Like the fat orange in the US office rn. A lot of gen Zers on the internet seem to worship him. He can do no wrong. They think that he actually cares about them. When in reality, he's just another rich a$$hole who couldn't give 0 sh\*ts about you.

Or when Kamala was running, it wasn't on a cult like level like then fat orange is. But ignored her when she supported a certain group (can't say the name here or else it won't go through) Basically ignored the bad parts. She did have some good points. But at the end of the day, she's just a rich b\*tch who again doesn't care about you.

It wasn‚Äôt until I want to say 2 years ago when I basically gutted my entire friend group and started dating my bf that my life got better. I hung out with people who just worked so hard at everything it made me want to work hard. I also didn‚Äôt need to reassure If the people around me even liked me because they showed me. 


Also the people I‚Äôm around now match my freak way more. Like I was never one to decline a solid party the people I was around before were always acting like parties weren‚Äôt the vibe or it was something only popular people did. 

We go to the gym often and my friends put me on to some great healthy alternatives. 

My bf really cares about me and legit wants to get married like soon.

i recently found out one of my distant classmate took his own life because of academic reasons and depression. i didnt talk to the guy at all before that because he barely talked to people in class, he looked fine but i didnt know he was going through such a tough time mentally. he was a very online person which was the interesting thing, always active on twitter and discord and posting schizo alt right memes or something. looking back it might have been a way of coping. i have undergone periods of depression and anxiety myself and somedays wished i didnt exist at all. but after seeing the guy do what he did, i feel stupid for thinking that.

it seems surreal being on the internet - gender wars, politics and shit. but in the end what is the point of all this? i might delete reddit soon but i feel like we as a generation are hiding a very intense case of depressive nihilism behind irony and memes."

GenZ,"So burnt out from school and work, and I don't know what to do.",3,2025-05-01 22:22:00,1,"

Kinda of a long post 
I(28M) graduated from my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2020 (I was 23 at the time) during the pandemic. My first job after graduating was a janitor (yes im serious), I took this job bc during COVID while everyone was getting jobs, I was struggling a lot to find any job and I took this one by getting a reference from a friend. I was making $20 an hour and I was grateful. Then I decided to enrol into my masters full online part time in computer science but once I  started this program , I got my first tech job making 60k . So for the last 3 years my life has been studying part time while working full time. My work performance was great and now I am at 103k. 

Now im graduating in 2 days however I am so burnt out now that I am even looking forward to my graduation ceremony that I will be attending on Saturday and then my solo trip to Florida. 

My personal life has been more a joke, as I don't have many people in my life now. All of my friends are now getting engaged or married (same age range as me) and I moved out of my parents house bc we had our differences. In terms of dating, I struck 0 luck, as I was told Im too ugly to date or that I looked a predator. So I decided to quit dating because it was too much of a problem for me and it was my first time and I never landed a single date lol. The  only reason I am still here is because I have my therapist and ive been going the gym. 

Im so burnt out and I don't what to do, I don't want to leave my job since I have a decent income  but I want to just take a break from everything. "

GenZ,Am I too brainrotted?,2,2025-05-01 21:52:57,2,"I made this post already in r/adulting and I thought why not also ask this here. 

Is it just me but as a Gen Z (21) and I just don't find the jokes that older Millenials and Gen x-Boomers tell funny. I work retail and the amount of unfunny ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù ‚Äúkids‚Äù or ‚Äúshopping  addiction‚Äù jokes people tell drives me up a wall. I hate having to pretend to laugh at a joke that is just straight-up not funny to me. But idk, it might just be me. My type of humor is like stan twitter memes or like tiktok videos or fandom-related things. so that might be why but I‚Äôm finding it super hard to relate to older people. 

But, its not like I don't enjoy comedy. I like The Office, Parks and Rec, Bob‚Äôs Burgers, What We Do In The Shadows, and shows like that but actually everyday conversations are just so‚Ä¶Unfunny. Its even worse when I'm at like an event with older people or at Chrurch. They‚Äôre always making jokes that to me are super unfunny. Maybe I‚Äôm just too brainrotted from all the TikToks and random Twitter memes but that's just my humor and I don't see it ever changing. I‚Äôm not good at faking a laugh so I always just look stoically while everyone else is laughing and I feel weird about it. And I feel like even when I get older and to the age of 30+ I still won‚Äôt find those jokes funny or maybe Gen Z humor will be interesting when we‚Äôre 30+.

Y'know like your Jimmy Carrs and stuff, I used to love that shit when I was younger.

But after a while I started maturing a bit and honestly the pure shock edgy comedy just isn't funny to me anymore. Like I still do it rarely, but it just isn't funny as it used to be.

I still think dark jokes can be funny, but to me I feel like they need to have a bit more substance in them. Make you think for a second, those are my type of jokes. Kinda like what Bill Burr or Louis CK would tell.

GenZ,Liberalism on college campuses,0,2025-05-01 18:44:21,183,"Look, I grew up in a house that watched Fox News. I've heard the ""liberal indoctrination"" argument a million times. But I was wondering what you all thought about the topic: do universities ""train"" people to be more liberal?

From personal experience, I'd say it's kind of a mixed bad. I go to one of the less liberal colleges (Ohio State), but even then, there's a lot of..... I call them *college liberals* who get frustratingly fanatical/fangirly about politics. Like, the exact people who ""virtue signal"" and trot around with signs and proceed to have barely anything actually interesting to say. I don't have a problem with these people outside the fact they generally treat politics the exact same way fanatical conservatives do: as a list of axioms to rally behind, without much actual debate going on. That frustrates me a lot.

So I think there's certainly an aspect of peer influence, but when it comes to the actual teachers, I don't see it. I'm not in a humanities field, and I know it's more prevalent there, but there's certainly very little leftist bias in Engineering. And the other classes I took, like philosophy (environmental ethics), were usually pretty balanced, because they wanted to provide as much data as possible. 

But what do you think?"

GenZ,I pretty much hate all weddings. Is this common amongst our generation?,0,2025-05-01 11:36:48,27,"
I just really needed to rant about how much I don‚Äôt like weddings. If it‚Äôs important, I‚Äôm a Gen Z man, I‚Äôm really introverted, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, and I‚Äôm very ‚Äúcareful with money‚Äù (iykyk).

Anyways, I have pretty much never liked weddings. It‚Äôs possible that the above info about me has influenced this feeling, but I digress. So, here are my main gripes with weddings:

- **Clothing:** Since every wedding I‚Äôve been to has been semi-formal, I‚Äôve dreaded having to get dressed for them. I hate wearing suits with all of my being, it‚Äôs just so uncomfortable (regardless of quality). I always say that I feel like a circus animal when I‚Äôm forced to wear a suit to any occasion.

- **Music:** The reception after the ceremony is usually centered around music/dancing. Now, I like music as much as the next guy, but I hate it in group settings, and I probably hate dancing just as much. So this means that I end up just sitting at the table on my phone, while everyone else is up on the dance floor, leaving nothing fun for me to do.

- **Cost:** As I mentioned earlier, I don‚Äôt like spending a lot of money, so weddings would obviously be a nightmare for me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been to a wedding that didn‚Äôt look expensive. I just look around and think, ‚ÄúI bet they spent a ridiculous amount of money on this‚Äù, making the experience less enjoyable for me.

- **People:** There‚Äôs just *so many* people at weddings (see *The Office* ‚Äúwe need a new plague‚Äù scene). Like, I get that weddings are meant for this number of people, but it makes me feel overwhelmed, even just as a guest. If I was up at the altar in this situation, I think I would have a panic attack having that many people watching me, seeing me pour out my emotions and waiting for me to screw things up. I just wouldn‚Äôt be able to take it.

There are a few other minor reasons that I won‚Äôt go into here, but that is the gist of it. I will say, though, that there usually is free food at these weddings, which is practically the only way I can enjoy them. Let me know if you have any of the same complaints that I do, or if I‚Äôm just a loner that‚Äôs needlessly hating on weddings."

GenZ,A hypothetical scenario for a Presidential scenario.,0,2025-05-01 12:31:33,34,"What would happen if the President of the United States were the best we can ask for?

He introduces Universal Healthcare, taxes the rich to the point that billionaires can't exist anymore, makes college free, etc. 

However, after all of the positive things he's done to the country. Something dark comes up from his past. He turned out to have been a war criminal in Iraq who helped massacre a village, and a photo comes out of him posing with a decapitated head.

Id say I'm average looking and pretty average all round. Average interests (basketball, video games, movies), average height, weight, etc. I'm sure these are factors too for why I may not be having success too but I'm wondering if it's such a problem, how do I go about getting experience?"
GenZ,Question:,1,2025-05-01 03:47:01,4,When will Gen Z reach unc status?
GenZ,I'm tired of having a MAGA Karen as a father,304,2025-04-29 20:37:41,179,"When I say ""Karen"", I mean the ""can I speak to the manager"", ""nurses are below doctors"", ""vaccines caused autism, which is a disease"", and more. He consumes political BS spun by MAGA people the way methheads consume methamphetamine, and is always trying to make something political. 

He makes generalizations about how Gen-Z girls in general always dress slutty and when I tried to point out that many girls (and people for that matter) will be sexualized no matter what we wear, he kept going back to how girls specifically dress slutty. There were so many times when he has told me to cover up when I'm in a basic tank top and high-waisted shorts (that's important) because I ""don't need to draw attention to myself"". And when I once again tried to tell him that I'd draw attention in a full sweatsuit, he disagreed with me. 

He also loves absorbing political stuff, talking about it, and politicizing anything and everything whenever he can. He went on a rant just last week about how vaccines are the cause of autism because the numbers have skyrocketed within the last 20 years. When I brought up that it's because of more accurate testing, he shut it down. My SIL is autistic, and while I am deaf and not autistic, I was still offended because he talked about autistic people with so much disgust. 

He has so much hatred and thinks Trump is the greatest President, and doesn't even see the problem with people worshiping him and calling Trump ""the chosen one"" despite calling himself a Christian. He has the blood pressure of a hummingbird and blows up at me for stuff so easily that I'm unsure if whatever I say or do will set him off. It's all so exhausting, and I've asked him to stop multiple times, but he never does. He doesn't seem bothered or even care that there's talk about Trump wanting to cut funding and programs that help disabled people (like me, his daughter). 

I've communicated in every way I know how about how all the political stuff makes me feel and yet he keeps talking about it (again, like he's addicted to it). I really hope I'm not the only one struggling with a parent like this. It's so mentally draining and just adds to the list of other mentally and emotionally draining things I'm dealing with."

GenZ,I love getting an engineering degree with no actual plan,2,2025-04-30 23:02:37,6,"Like, I've only got the first year done as of yesterday, so there's time, but I honestly don't know what the end goal is. They always talk down at the university about like, having actual goals and a vision for the field you wanna be in.... but come on. I have a few ideas of things I like, but ultimately I just want something that's most likely to get me a job I can stand. 

So I'm in mechanical engineering to hope that, once I get out, I can weasel my way into the stuff I actually care about (I'm really interested in like, green engineering / power and would love to focus on sustainability). Like, a nuclear plant would be cool, the issue is that I don't know where the companies are, and most of the actual plants are in the middle of nowhere (there's one \~2 hours from me that I'm familiar with, and 3 total in my state).

GenZ,Do you scroll on your phone first thing in the morning?,33,2025-04-29 22:56:32,18,"most of us (I think) wake up and go straight into the loop notifications, tiktok, texts, doomscrolling. before our brain even realises we‚Äôre awake, we‚Äôve already consumed more input than our grandparents probably got all day.

and then we wonder why we feel anxious, foggy, unmotivated, overstimulated, drained by 11am.

i‚Äôm not judging, i did the same for years. but the one thing that actually helped (and i‚Äôve never heard anyone around me take seriously) is just getting outside first before any of that. like literally 2 minutes of sunlight on your face within 10‚Äì15 minutes of waking up.

no phone. no stimulation. just light and air.

sounds dumb. but it resets your brain. it anchors you in the day. and it‚Äôs actually one of the only free, science-backed things that helps with sleep, energy, mood, focus, all of it.

we complain a lot (fair enough), but if you haven‚Äôt tried changing the first thing you do in the morning, you‚Äôre skipping one of the easiest wins.

this helped me more than journaling, cold showers, or whatever else gets recommended.
sunlight. early. daily. before the feed gets to you.

Do you guys agree?

GenZ,Why is high school so glorified by American media when in reality most of us had less than stellar experiences in it?,106,2025-04-29 16:41:59,49,"Obviously everyone's lives and perceptions are different. But the general consensus I gather by most people in person and online is a lukewarm ""It was okay. I had some fun times, I liked seeing my friends, but I was happy it was over and I wouldn't want to go back"". And there's tons of people everywhere who had way worse experiences than that.

Yet many movies and shows love to present it like the ""best time of our life"". Casting attractive twenty somethings to play the characters who go about their lives partying, drinking, getting laid, spending days with their groups of loyal friends, going to all the school events, and falling in love. They might encounter a few issues here and there, maybe deal with some assholes/bullies, but everything works out in the end and they find who they truly are and who is really in their corner to defend them no matter what.

In reality weren't we all just kind of bored, irritated, tired, and confused in this time of our lives? Hormonal adolescents all forced together in a dull and confined place taking classes we didn't care about, seeing people we disliked, and we just couldn't wait every day for the bell to ring so we could leave. Social cliques are also WAY less prevalent than is depicted. And we likely worried about a bunch of stuff that actually didn't matter at all. 

So why does so much media continue to paint a different picture of the teenage life? Does anyone else feel that could partly be to blame of what made us disappointed or depressed in how things really turned out? Granted, in the last 12 or so years there has been an attempt to move away from that with more dramatic depictions of the teenage life. But even a lot of those make it seem much more ""exciting"" then it really is (such as Euphoria). When like I already said, it was just kind of ""meh"" for most of us. And for many it was worse than that. The more positive depictions I'm talking about are mostly from the 80's, 90's, and 2000's, so perhaps high school was better back in the day for previous generations? Is social media to blame for ""ruining"" it for us?

Now the question is that the majority of Incels are precisely in this age group (15 to 30 years old). Maybe it's not just a matter of them being inept or unpleasent, but simply a portion of men necessarily have to be single (basic math) in this age group."

He we go again with another divisive generational generalization war post‚Ä¶ People love to talk shit about Boomers, Millennials, Gen Z‚Ä¶ but honestly the most insufferable people I have dealt with are Gen X.

It‚Äôs like they are amplified boomers but with less class and more anger‚Ä¶ truly obsessed with kicking younger generations down and ensuring they are suckers and slaves to the man and status quo just like them - because accepting that there are other ways to live and be would mean accepting that they could have done that too.

I went to many football games, basketball games, dances, and prom. In senior year, I was nominated for two superlatives, and a lot of people signed both the front and the back of my yearbook. I also came out as gay to my friends and loved ones. I experienced people whom just didn't like me, but that never mattered to me, and I never experienced any bullying. And while I lost a lot of friends and acquaintances, I also gained a lot of new friends and acquaintances. Overall, while high school was four years of hell, it was also four years of heaven."

GenZ,"Why is it acceptable to point out physical differences between different ethnicities, but racist to point out that different ethnicities might have different forms of intelligence?",0,2025-04-30 16:50:53,36,"In society, it‚Äôs typically acceptable to acknowledge that different ethnic groups may have physical traits that give them advantages in certain areas. For example, some groups are known to excel at sprinting or long-distance running, others are better adapted to high altitudes, some have more resistance to UV radiation, while others are better at absorbing vitamin D in low-sunlight environments. We recognize these differences as natural adaptations to different environments over thousands of years.

However, when it comes to intelligence, it's considered racist to suggest that different groups might have developed different cognitive strengths. I want to be very clear,¬†**I‚Äôm not saying that any race is more or less intelligent than another.**¬†That‚Äôs not the point I'm making.

If we accept that humans have physically adapted to their environments, why wouldn‚Äôt we also consider the possibility that humans have mentally or cognitively adapted as well?

Depending on the group's environmental challenges, natural selection may have favored certain cognitive traits. For example, perhaps people whose ancestors were hunter-gatherers developed certain types of intelligence well-suited to that lifestyle, such as spatial awareness or short-term memory. In contrast, people whose ancestors lived in agricultural societies may have developed different cognitive strengths, such as long-term planning or social coordination.

I still need to do more research on this topic, and I‚Äôm not making any strong claims, but it seems like a question worth exploring.

GenZ,Shedeur sanders,5,2025-04-29 18:18:41,17,"This is really just for the NFL noobs or people who‚Äôve seen this blowup on whatever side of IG they‚Äôre on to hear the flip side of this coin, because Recently after the nfl draft a bunch of new influencers and social media people are complaining about how sanders wasn‚Äôt drafted in the first round nor first overall due to being a ‚Äúconfident black man‚Äù these assumptions are usually said by people who dont actually watch college football nor care about, these fans usually just hopped on the college football train when they heard Deion sanders was hired at Colorado and actually believed the hype and headlines around that program. 

Here‚Äôs the truth about shedeur sanders and why he fell to the 5th round. 

1: zero pocket presence, he holds on to the ball for wayyyyy too long and tries to make something happen that‚Äôs just not there, he‚Äôs not very mobile having -50 rushing yards at Colorado, he‚Äôs been sacked almost 100 times in his two years at Colorado setting an ncaa record I believe. Yes he didn‚Äôt have a great offensive line but at some point you have to get out of the pocket or just throw it away. 

2: average arm strength, and he cannot throw his receivers open. 

3: 45 completion percentage for any pass longer than 10 yards downfield, which is horrible. Most of his passes were screens which led to him having a 73 completion percentage but the reality is homie cannot connect on deep passes. 

4: his Attitude is insane, despite being a mid qb he carries himself like baker mayfield and Jonny manziel. Here‚Äôs the thing, if you wanna talk and act like baker that‚Äôs great I loved watching baker do that in college, but you gotta play like baker too. See baker mayfield ran his mouth and flipped off opponents and basically shit talked anyone and everyone on the field. You know what else baker did? He won. And he won a lot. Almost won the heisman twice and a national championship, led his teams to winning dominant seasons. Baker backed up every word that came out of his mouth, that dude was special. And come draft day he was still called ‚Äúundraftable‚Äù by several talking heads due to his attitude. 

5: he did not win, never won a bowl game and struggled badly against better talent, even in the game against a 3 win Oklahoma state he was still sacked 6 times I believe and they won that game 52-0. Yes he set Colorado records for passing yards but Colorado has never been a serious program, they‚Äôve had concession stand workers as their QB‚Äôs in the past, so it‚Äôs not really saying much to nfl scouts like setting passing records at a place like Oklahoma would. 

6: the media straight up just lied to yall about Colorado as a program and this kid. Soooooo much hype around sanders and not a whole lot of results, that‚Äôs just what it is at the end of the day. And it‚Äôs kinda the same situation with arch manning at Texas, hall of fame relatives but a whole world of hype for not much production (In arch mannings defense he hasn‚Äôt gotten much playing time being an underclassmen so jury is still out on him) "
GenZ,"What is something you don‚Äôt like to do, even though society expects you to?",18,2025-04-29 11:18:41,59,"As someone who values self-reflection and challenges societal norms, I often find myself questioning things I‚Äôm ""supposed"" to do.

For example, I‚Äôve noticed that society seems to expect everyone to constantly be ""busy""‚Äîas if productivity is the ultimate marker of success. But honestly, I don‚Äôt like always having something to do. Sometimes, I just want to take a step back and not be constantly working on something or filling my schedule with events.

It's damn rare that I pursue a romantic relationship so when I do, I mean business and these two women shattered me to a million pieces. First one I had something going on for 3 months (so I thought at least), we could only see each other every Saturday, so whether we did the dishes or watched a movie, it always felt incredible. I asked her out on a real date and I got these responses ""No, you are more like a brother for me"" ""I was just having fun, I flirt with all my male friends""... Hardly slept, ate or moved out of my bed for two weeks.

Second one, we hung out 3 or 4 days a week. I took it much slower given what had happened. It felt as if this time it was actually getting real and then, she gets a boyfriend and not long after she goes ghost.

You guys are actively ruining the fun of this sub with all of the bitter complaining. And I‚Äôm saying this with so much love. I love men. I love love love men. I never outgrew my boy crazy phase. 

Please, stop basing all your judgments off of the digital and online world and go outside. Look at the couples around you. 

Is every guy that is with a girl over 6 feet, with hunter eyes, a square jaw, a salary of 100k/year and fucking jacked? No? Maybe it‚Äôs because those things don‚Äôt really matter to most women and only matter to vapid, shallow, chronically online loser women! Any woman that insists you have to have all of the perfect traits to be worthy of sex and love is a loser and not worth your time. Why are you trying to impress someone that shallow? 

There are normal women walking around that probably have noticed you but have been put off by your bitter attitude. 

You want to get revenge on women for making you feel overlooked? Work on yourself so much that it‚Äôs impossible to overlook you. And I don‚Äôt mean in appearance. Study philosophy, psychology, history and science. Nurture your mind so that you‚Äôre completely unbothered when someone tries to make you feel less than. Build your self and your self esteem to be so high, that when a girl rejects you, YOU laugh, because she‚Äôs a fool to not recognize your worth. 

As a man, as a human being, you are never any less or more than another person because of your body and appearance. 

As a man, as a human being, you have more purpose than being a sex machine and provider. 

You get to decide what manhood is to you. 

There‚Äôs more to being a man than having sex with a woman. 

There‚Äôs more fulfillment in life than merely sex. 

You are not worthless because you haven‚Äôt had sex. And anyone who tries to say so is lying to you and trying to hurt you. "

GenZ,I do not understand the pressure around relationships,0,2025-04-29 18:33:43,69,"So many posts revolve around relationships and I just never understood the need for it. Now I‚Äôll be the first to admit I‚Äôm not the most social person but I do crave partnership but because I haven‚Äôt found someone I like I just make friends. It fills the need pretty well and I‚Äôd rather be alone than to rush into relationships. 

I also don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúgetting to know  someone just for the purpose of maybe dating‚Äù The few people I‚Äôve dated have been friends first and foremost. We‚Äôve known each other for months if not years and get along well. Getting into a relationship before you even know if you can handle being around someone for more than 6 hours straight is odd to me. It also lowers the ‚Äúnew relationship excitement‚Äù because you already know how to be casual around each other.

Another thing is the dramatic break ups. Like talk to each other and handle it maturely (I‚Äôm not talking about toxic relationships where people are legit getting hurt and need help.). Feelings come and go and if someone falls out of love with you it sucks yeah but you can‚Äôt force them too. It‚Äôs not always even an attack on you it‚Äôs just feelings change. Accept that and don‚Äôt let it make you miserable. 

Another thing that actually pisses me off is the lack of trust. I don‚Äôt need to be in contact with someone 24/7 if they can‚Äôt answer or see me or whatever then they just can‚Äôt. People are busy. Also don‚Äôt date someone you can‚Äôt trust that won‚Äôt make a healthy relationship. And if you‚Äôre not mature enough to trust your partner with their opposite sex friends then that‚Äôs a you problem 9 times out of 10. If there actually is something really bothering you about their behaviour talk to your partner. COMMUNICATE! 

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I‚Äôm not bothered at all by people being friends with exs (which seems like a hot talk sometimes). If they separated on a good note and maybe were friends before getting together they don‚Äôt need to cut each other off and if they do still have feelings for each other then they‚Äôre not ready for a new relationship and you shouldn‚Äôt be dating. 

My parents married mid thirties and had kids early forties and late thirties. It‚Äôs not too late to find a relationship. You didn‚Äôt miss out on some high school love story. Be comfortable and fulfilling on your own and good partners will come.

GenZ,Can y'all talk about something other than your own willfully depressing love lives?,1,2025-04-29 09:41:39,30,"This is a subreddit meant to be about discussing topics related to this generation.

More than half of y'all of our generation are already adults, I wouldnt mind seeing this on r/teenagers or whatever, but y'all are beyond this age of tolerance for stupidity...

Stop with the gender war whiny posts. Genuinely. Stop. I don't care. ""Then leave"". No. You leave. Genuinely. You give no value to this subreddit, you only bring toxicity and hate to this space, the comment sections ALWAYS devolve into the same cahotic and horrid sea of toxicity that never goes anywhere.

Let's get some things straight:

Today's word sucks. We have allowed our society and social life to be dominated by social media, and that has taken a toll, on everyone! Not just men. Everyone. It's confusing times.

And it's normal to hate this. I hate this. I hate the loneliness I feel from this society we live in.

But please, use the resources at your disposal. This includes introspection, this includes compassion, this includes professional help.

1. If you have the means, PLEASE, seek professional help. I will be honest with you: there are bad apples out there when it comes to therapists. But there are great ones as well. I speak from personal experience on both.

What I end up seeing here, night and day, is people whining about crap that can be resumed as the ""gender war"" online BS. It does not help you. It does not help anybody.

Let's start with some definitions, a though topic for some people: Incels. What is an incel. ""Oh nowadays women call everyone they dislike an incel"". ""These people cry about being lonely but then go on to hate women"".

Let's go step by step.

What is NOT an incel:

- Being lonely. You are not an incel because you are alone. Being lonely is a very natural human reaction. It's an emotion we all have and sometimes feel, and unfortunately some of us end up feeling it more than others.

- The simple fact of not having sex. This is not how celibacy works, and is the root cause of the misconception of this whole term. ""Involuntary celibacy"" is an oxymoron.

An ascetic is someone who willfully abstains from food. A starving child is not an involuntary ascetic.

Likewise a person who doesnt have sex, not out of choice, is not an ""incel""


What IS an incel:

-A person who blames their shortcomings in their love/sex life on the opposite gender.

We more often than not associate this with men hating women, but the opposite can also happen (what people call ""femcels"")

It is the act of being hateful of the opposite sex because they somehow are the reason for your issues in life.

Inceldom is not a natural state (i.e. not having sex), but a way of thinking. A toxic way of thinking because it HINDERS you.

Listen, if you want to be in a relationship so much, how is that going to happen when you're so hostile towards the opposite sex?

And let me tell you, when we form negative opinions, it is a slippery slope to just start growing and growing them through confirmation bias.

An example from earlier in the post: I've had bad experiences with therapists. But eventually got a good one. But imagine I hadnt? There's a good chance I would have started confirming a bias that ""Every therapist is bad, huh?"". May make sense for my FRUSTRATED mind, but it is not the actual reality.


So please exercise point 2

2: Introspection, intrsopection, introspection. WHY are you lonely? WHY are you alone? Think about that. We live in the age of chatbots, you can use them as private talk-back buddies to circulate ideas out of your head and into written form.

Dont let it allow devolve into toxic and unproductive biases. Reach the actual root of the problem. Only from there can we handle solution


And think before you allow yourself to be engulfed by the toxicity online.

Do you really think instagram/youtube/tiktok shorts reflect reality

Why do you think you only see shorts of men on the street asking what women want in a partner and all they say is ""6feet 6 figures""??? Because these vapid, superficial people EXIST, and they only post them because they are ENGAGING, and make the content creater money through views, like yours.

Hate is the currency of our time. YOUR hate. Dont be hateful just so you can make some tool on the internet rake in money from you.

3. Be compassionate. Compassionate and empathetic.

What do you want? What do you want in life? What do you like? What do you enjoy? Do you think people out there are so different from you on those things?


Lay aside your ""statistics"" and ""video evidence on social media"" and actually exercise your compassion. Heck, I know it is a cliche, but go outside. Meet actual real people.

You'll quickly see that those videos are nonsense.

You're not an incel for being alone. You're not an incel for being a virgin, even. Who cares if you're a virgin, seriously. People not worth your time, that's who.

You're an incel for hating on women because some tool online told you to. Don't be.

You only live once. And you're only young once. Do you really want to spend it being hateful online and hiding away from society because you're scared of the extreme ""what ifs""?

Please. Exercise these 3 things, they all come down to one thing: Loving yourself.

It's clich√© but true. Love yourself. You are worthy of unconditional love.

""But I am an awful person I dont deserve love."" 

Is that true? Have you done bad things? Said bad things? Who hasn't?

What matters is whether we want to move forward. Whether we want to improve ourselves.

There's a place for us all out there in the world, we just have to be willing to fight for it.

The men and women on the internet seeking to tell you tales of the hateful where ""Women are all this this and that"" or ""Mrn are all this this and that"" dont want you to love, they dont want you to even love yourself. They want you to be angry and hateful, so you keep watching their content and making them money.



There is no gender war. Just immaturity. Grow yourself, future yoh will thank you for it.

Women don't want someone who's going to make them look bad on social media. It's really that simple. Losing social status is the one thing they will avoid and gaining it is of extreme importance.

There's people online who will lie to you and say exceptions disprove generalizations. We had a word for people like that back in 2021, covid vaccine deniers. We have a word for people like that in 2025, gender affirming surgery deniers.

GenZ,Society didn‚Äôt just fail young men. It failed young people. And it‚Äôs your job to fix yourself anyway.,885,2025-04-27 16:40:13,799,"Point blank:  
most of the stuff young men are struggling with?  
**Young women are struggling with it too.**

The only *truly unique* thing that affected young men is that society failed them in their primary and emotional education.  
Women didn‚Äôt have it easier ‚Äî **we were just messed up in the opposite direction.**

And guess what?  
Those problems you have from being failed by your parents, teachers, and society?  
**They aren't anyone else's problem to fix.**  
Not women‚Äôs. Not the government‚Äôs.  
Yours.

You want to stop feeling worthless?  
**Getting friends or a girlfriend won't fix that.** Period.

You need therapy.  
You need to learn how to sit alone with yourself and not want to die.  
You need to accept that you are flawed, and that there will never be a day where you ""arrive"" perfect. You will always be growing. Always healing.

I was raised without emotional regulation too.  
I had severe depression.  
If I were a dude, high chance I would've become an incel.

I can even empathize with horrible people like school shooters, mass killers ‚Äî because I've felt that depth of malice. I've dealt with suicidal and homicidal ideation.

**Guess what I did?**

I got treatment.  
I got medicated (not everyone needs meds).  
I went to therapy.  
I learned DBT skills.  
I did DIY CBT on myself when I couldn‚Äôt afford therapy.  
I *put in the work.*

Nobody saved me.  
I **chose** to save myself.

If women invalidate your feelings?  
Learn the language to communicate that.  
If they still don't care? They're assholes. Distance yourself. Find better people.  
**There are always better people.**

Society isn‚Äôt going to fix your problems for you.  
Even if society caused them.  
It's unfair, but that's life.  
**Heal for yourself. Heal for the next generation.**

Young women are struggling too.  
It‚Äôs ***infuriating*** to hear endless media crying about ""how society is failing young men"" when it‚Äôs ***actually failing all young people.***

We are ALL getting ground to dust by:

* late stage capitalism
* a collapsing cost of living
* stagnant wages
* decaying social trust
* dead-end jobs (at least in Canada)

**You are not uniquely broken.**  
**You are simply living through the same shitstorm as everyone else.**

The emotional issues many young men are facing?  
**They're intergenerational problems.**  
You didn‚Äôt cause them ‚Äî but you‚Äôre responsible for stopping the cycle.

>""but men are lonely!""

So are women.  
I barely know how to make friends either.  
I spend most of my time alone.  
If I wanted a boyfriend, I'd want one who could be my best friend first and foremost.  
Because **a relationship without real friendship is just loneliness with extra steps.**

Honestly?  
A lot of men weren‚Äôt taught how to value real friendship.  
They were taught to seek validation through girlfriends, or not at all.

That's not your fault.  
But it's your responsibility to **grow past it.**

Beyond basic human rights, you are not *entitled* to anything.  
Not a relationship.  
Not attention.  
Not love.

You may never get a girlfriend.  
You may never get the validation you think you need.

**And you have to be okay anyway.**

Your value is not measured by whether you ""land a chick.""  
You are your own person.  
You have dreams, skills, and wishes beyond that.  
**Build your life for yourself.**

You deserve to heal ‚Äî but you‚Äôre the only one who can decide to start."

Sometimes I get the thought ‚Äúmaybe our generation is just lazy‚Ä¶ maybe we just don‚Äôt want to work as hard because of cell phone being bad or something.‚Äù But when you look at the numbers and the data on it, it really feels like the only thing we‚Äôre getting is screwed.

It‚Äôs like we all grew up, became actual adults and were smart enough to see what had changed, but by then, it was already too late to do anything about it. The drawbridge had been pulled up before we even knew we were supposed to cross it.

Sometimes I really wish smartphones and social media would just - poof - be gone, because I feel like more people would go out and find people to hang out with if they did't have a phone as a crutch from being bored at home.

Hopefully, this gen z subreddit can branch off into other gen z subreddits cause if I see another post about dudes complaining about their dating life and how at fault women are for everything, I swear to god-

I dont know if i would start the subreddit up, tho. I don't think I would be a good subreddit owner lol


Edit: i see the idea of a gen z non-political subreddit, people agree on.  A gen z subreddit for more lighthearted, unserious content. I think that would be nice"

GenZ,Survey for my research : How does GenZ work towards their goals?,3,2025-04-28 15:46:03,2,"I‚Äôm conducting a quick survey to better understand the challenges we face when it comes to setting and achieving our goals. Whether it‚Äôs career, fitness, personal growth, or managing multiple priorities, we all face obstacles, and I want to know what‚Äôs been the hardest part for you.

  
Here‚Äôs the link to the survey:  
[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLgJ6dB-Y30fad79W\_XYjTZBrDb5dhKu4FA9VRLj8ZtcGtdA/viewform?usp=header](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLgJ6dB-Y30fad79W_XYjTZBrDb5dhKu4FA9VRLj8ZtcGtdA/viewform?usp=header)

The survey is short (should only take about 5 minutes) and completely anonymous. Your insights will help shed light on the common struggles people face and how we can tackle them together.

**What I'm trying to learn:**

* What kinds of goals you usually focus on
* The biggest roadblocks you encounter when trying to make progress
* How you stay motivated or what stops you from reaching your goals

I‚Äôd really appreciate your input!  It‚Äôs all about learning from each other and finding better ways to approach goal-setting in our busy lives.

Thanks so much for your time! "
GenZ,any men getting called simp for treating women with basic decency nowadays?,144,2025-04-27 18:26:18,95,"i thought calling people 'simp' died off a few years back, its funny how people still say shit like 'simp' and ""she isnt going to sleep with you"" just because i smiled and asked how her day was?

GenZ,Guys if there is male loneliness epidemic why isn't there a female one as well,0,2025-04-29 07:11:17,65,"Like everyone keeps saying that men don't have any real life connection with women and how this lack of social connection and isolation is leading to societies destruction.

How lonely men who haven't dated women are increasing in number and will turn to far right.

But what about women? If there is a large number of men who haven't or are not dating women. Then it stands to reason that a large number of women also have no social connection with the opposite gender. And they are not dating as well. So why is there no female loneliness epidemic. Or are women just immune to loneliness?"
GenZ,"The Red, The Right, and the Lies. A writing by Aki Flowers.",0,2025-04-29 01:40:12,3,"There was only the sheen-a most calm color- called red.

Values by it stands of a crucifix' shares, where it withholds all sustenance for itself yet consume more not. When in time it dines in wine it drinks problems away without care. Glitter here and glitter there, glamorizing and moralizing, black and white, grey ambiguity only to serve red's rights. It cannot misconstrue nor does it polarize, it must be blue that makes evil arise. And if it did rise with red, that is fine too for the bread and wine are fine for my ignorant minds stew.

Right is right, there can be no other interpretation. A fact so loud 'I'm' proud that like right is white, clear without needing citations. A most hauntingly beautiful direction indeed that be it must. If not that then from there why is there a pungently defined musk? Would it be correct to ascertain it must be truth it must be tried or then would our truth be too much for ignorant minds to hide. But to the future its right of course its right where on discovery and destiny had manifest her for 'our' plight.

I've been using Reddit since 2016 and honestly, it's just a waste of time now. Every subreddit is toxic and negative. For example, go and ask about dating advice on Reddit. You got one forever alone loser saying all women want is a 6'0 Chad with money and how Western women blah, blah, blah. Then go outside you'll see plenty of short people dating. Then you've women on Reddit saying don't approach women in public we hate it. Go outside and ask around most women would love to be approached more. These are just two small examples. I'm not even going to attempt to touch on how politics has infected almost every subreddit now. Even when I go to my favorite YouTuber or social media person subreddit it's just them being extremely judgmental like they aren't humans with flaws. We only see 30 minutes of their day and you're writing an essay of how much of a terrible human being the person is. Anyway, I just want to know if anyone else feels the same way. "

GenZ,My phone journey,10,2025-04-28 04:27:19,9,"I got my first phone at 9 years old, which I gauge to be a little earlier than most of us on the older half of Gen Z. Here‚Äôs the journey.

Casio G‚ÄôZone Boulder (2011-2012)
LG Cosmos (2013-2015)
Motorola Droid Turbo 2 (2015-2017)
LG G6 (2017-2019)
iPhone XR (2019-2021)
iPhone 12 Pro Max (2021-2025)
iPhone 16 Pro Max (Yesterday-Present)

The Boulder was, well, a boulder. Solid phone that was super common. It was probably the ‚Äúevery man‚Äôs phone‚Äù at the time. I loved it as my first device.

All in all, the Cosmos was my favorite. The Cosmos/iPod Nano combo was awesome. Did I get picked on by the touchscreen kids? Yeah. Did I care? Nope.  

The Motorola was the coolest, but it ended up having the shortest life. It overheated crazy fast, especially while *off*, and burned me badly through my pockets during some state testing. Motorola had the sickest customization for their phones however. 

The LG G6 was the biggest let down. More overheating problems and it became sluggish after year 1. The camera quality was poor for a flagship phone. The Android OS customization on it was good however. Plus it was pretty damn sleek.

The iPhone XR was the perfect segue into Apple phones. Great mid-budget phone for the time. All in all a great product that I really didn‚Äôt need to replace.

The iPhone 12 Pro Max was a great phone, only a slight upgrade to the XR accessibility wise, but I really wanted the camera. Its service life was the longest, with the battery finally giving out recently.

The iPhone 16 Pro Max seems to be good so far. For all I care, it‚Äôs the exact same phone as the 12 but with an even better camera. I Urbex and don‚Äôt bother carrying digital cameras with me, so this is the best I can do. If not for that, I would‚Äôve gone for an older, cheaper option. 

How‚Äôd your journey look?

GenZ,Frat guys are so weird,479,2025-04-27 02:02:00,96,"After a year of college, my preconceived notions about fraternities and Greek life have not been proven wrong. 

Not to say that *every single* frat guy is a bad dude. Plenty have just been... well, dudes. But I won't lie, the majority of toxic behavior I've seen.... has been from fraternities. 

The most unabashedly sexist environment I've been in at college has been a frat party. Between the ratio bullshit, the obsession with women, the way they give out alcohol. The worst behaved people on campus are always the 2am kids coming back. The people who harass my friends the most are all the guys with those fucking hats that are half on their head. 

Even the music frat I did some stuff with had the weirdest masculine energy to it. Like, that really obnoxious ribbing was everywhere and even more annoying than usual. Never been called out more on being gay then around those guys, and they talk about women often enough that I either have to awkwardly stay quiet or mention it. 

Also my one friend from high school graduated a year before me, went off, joined a frat, and came back ranting about woke Disney. Literally can't make this shit up.

GenZ,"To all the Men in this Sub, this is for you. You need to stop and start something new.",0,2025-04-28 19:50:39,78,"Whenever I look at my Reddit feed, I see a message from this sub from a woman trying to advise us. It's usually very thoughtful and empathetic, but it cuts to the core of what needs to be done for many of us to become better. Then y'all come in and just attack them constantly. It's frankly really upsetting. Like the advice they give is generalized ideas on how we can change; don't y'all realize that? If a piece of it doesn't fit, you can change it to fit, or ignore it if you want (though I think you should not ignore it).

Look, I'm a guy, alright, and I can promise you that it is all goodwill. This advice has been given to us for god knows how long, and a lot of dudes just don't listen. So it makes sense that now, the people outside of the burning room we are in (which is surrounded by a larger burning house) is trying not to sugar coat what we can do to help ourselves.

Like, we are ALL suffering, please don't forget that, men. There are internalized gender issues on both sides, that sadly fall on both sides to fix. Men aren't the only ones suffering; hell, I'd argue we all know that men are the oppressor group in this situation. (This of course, coming from me, a poc perspective). This at the end of the day is my answer to why I was so fucked up when I first started college, and how I've pushed myself to be better.

With all that being said, I'd like to offer some free insight for anyone reading this, even those of use who don't fall under the male gender tag. I've done years of work to try to be better, so maybe this hand down might help someone of my group. This might also give some insight on ""why are we like this"".

Doing my mental work on trying to figure out why I (uniquely) was messed up like this. I realize that in general (and this is news to noone) we men are socialized to believe we can ONLY be vulnerable with women we perceive to have a close relationship with. You see this a lot in movies, where the male lead is just ""given"" a woman. Then all the scenes with that woman are usually these like... tender, vulnerable scenes of the man letting down his mask. That or just general... mommy issues you see in a lot of men. I see this leading to the whole ""women therapist"" situation that happens alot.

That, mixed with how our society puts sex as a main marker for maturity for men, a lot of men see sex as a gateway to vulnerability. Those relationships with women will finally ""give us"" a chance to be vulnerable. To be mature, to fix whatever is fucked up with us. Which leads into alot of men with standards they don't understand, getting into relationships, and hurting women in the process.

And bam, men do something stupid, get hurt, and eventually fall red pill pipelines since that is the only LARGLEY accessible community for men in this fucked up ass patriarchy twisted up in capitalism.  OF COURSE its way more complicated then that, but thats... a general view on the root of alot of male issues. This fucked up dance between wanting to be understood, wanting to be loved, vulnerability, and just a lot of hurt feelings. ITS FUCKED. And this is just a generalization of it, based on what I saw in myself and what I saw in the people around.

MEN, this is to you. Listen to the women on this sub. It might hurt, but it hurts because deep down you know it applies to you. You know there's something wrong. Nothing wrong with asking questions, but we sadly are the only ones that can fix our issues right now in general. That is the sad truth. Women are understandably fed up bc when we hurt, we hurt them on some level. Sadly the most common outcome being... death or worse for them.

**Outside of the advice the women on this sub give us, I have some that helped me in the beginning.**

1.) Read feminist literature focused on the Gender condition. BELL HOOKS is an excellent place to start.

2.) While you're at it, read a lot of romance. It will help you cope until you can get back out into the world and try to find love. Read some yoai, trust me, it hits.

3.) Make a VERY VERY intense list of your icks, and standards you want from a partner. This will help you and the women in your life so you can stop seeing every woman in your life as another romance option. RAISE YOUR FUCKING STANDARDS DEAR GOD. IF you do that, you'll prevent ending up in a relationship that will hurt you and someone you care about.

4.) Work on your empathy towards people who aren't like you. Be empathetic towards the women in your life. There's a time and place to talk about your issues, its NOT when women are talking about theirs. If she says ""I HATE MEN"" she isnt talking about you lil bro. Stop this ""NOT ALL MEN"" Crap. Don't get defensive. Just listen, and try to understand why she is suffering. This street goes both ways, but you need to be willing to listen and digest what your female friends are saying. For example, when I say ""I hate white people,"" most of my white friends understand that I love them, and I'm making a generalized statement. It's not about them in particular.

5.) Try to kill the idea of what a man should be in your head. That shit was fed to us by the dudes in power right now. YOU DECIDED what being a man is, not them. Hell, not even me. Fuck their approval. Engage in things that are more fem. That is the best way you can fight this.

6.) Build your confidence healthily. Work on your hygiene, get some clothes you like, and go to your local bar at least. Go talk to some people who AREN'T in Discord, or Tumblr, or Reddit. You see someone who is pretty? Go tell them that, and wish them to have a fun night. THEN GO DO SOMETHING ELSE. BE KIND TO OTHER PEOPLE WITHOUT THE INTENTION OF GETTING SOMETHING BACK DEAR GOD.

7.) Speaking of which, BE KIND to the people around you. Men, women, whoever. Compliment people, tell them nice things. Be caring. But also hold people who are shitty accountable, even when someone isnt watching. That is the kindest thing you can do. If we all did that, we would all be better off in the long run.

8.) Get a hobby. Even if its hard to keep up with, get a hobby. This is another way to cope. Preferably something productive so you feel a sense of accomplishment. Sewing, art, reading, running, whatever it is. Make sure its something you can track, and tangibly see the progress of around you. If it's gaming, make a gaming list of all the single-player games you've completed at least. Physically keep track of it.

9.) Once you have that hobby, find people you can physically see in front of you, and do the hobby together. Talk about the hobby. Trade info about it. Join a club around your hobby. MAKE a club around your hobby. This is another way to cope. This will also help your social skills.

I'm sure there's more I could give, but this is off the top of my head. Stop pushing our issues onto women. Stop blaming them for our issues. I will say that these issues are resolved by being just a bit more kind to yourself, to the people around you, and by just...... not being online as much. ALOT of people are more chill in person. And do things won't just STOP your issues. They will from time to time call out to you like the Joker mask, and you just gotta say no. Have the strength to say no.

If... anyone wants to pick my brain. Im willing to answer, but this is all from my perspective. Healing is not a journey with an end, its something you do every day. Lord knows I still have a ways to go. But I'm working on it.

Take this from a 27-year-old, 300+ lbs man, it gets easier if you are willing to do the work to be better. Women will love us more if you just fucking work on yourself. Please. It's not about your looks or the job you have. It's you, and who you are. Fix yourself, and it will all get easier."

GenZ,Opinion: everyone should grow their hair out at least once,18,2025-04-27 17:35:06,11,"I have been growing my hair out for 8 months and it has helped me learn so many things about my hair and hair care my two most important lessons from this was finding out where my hairline is/where my hair naturally parts, and I noticed and learned to live with regular hair fall"
GenZ,For all us that need to hear it: dont be so hard on yourself!,13,2025-04-27 18:36:33,23,"As an older Gen Z it‚Äôs hard to hear what the media says about our generation. We are supposedly the most educated and ‚Äúpromising‚Äù generation, but we also lack soft skills, attention span, work ethic, etc.  
  
I often internalize such criticisms and seek to be exactly what everyone wants us to be; perfect. Which, I believe, despite being an unrealistic expectation, is a fundamental feature of our generation. We internalize information and seek to improve; to be better than and learn from the mistakes of those that came before us.
  
However, this often leads our generation to be, as the media puts it, ‚Äúoverly sensitive.‚Äù Because we internalize criticism and seek perfection, it leaves us especially vulnerable to those criticisms and has us chasing an unobtainable goal.  
  
I‚Äôm sure every generation has dealt with this to some degree, but exposure to the internet has certainly played its part in exemplifying the problem, as we can read the articles ourselves rather than just hearing it from parents and colleagues that can coach us through it, or finding some dark corner to get away from it all. Leaving us exposed to the full brunt of the attack. 
  
For instance, if you are like me, growing up with the internet has been hard. We are constantly exposed to information that is constantly changing and we are expected not just to make sense of it but also to do so better and faster than older generations.  
  
For older generations out there who don‚Äôt understand the problem, I will equate it to one of the prevailing questions in astrophysics: how tf can we figure out how everything in the universe is moving when we do not have a stationary object for reference.  
  
In other words, the reason Gen Z is so ‚Äúclueless‚Äù is because everything around us is constantly changing and we have no fundamental knowledge to act as a lens by which to read that change, because even the ‚Äúfundamental knowledge‚Äù is disputed.  
  
For all the millennials and elder zoomers out there who were originally taught that Pluto was a planet, only for its status to be changed a short while later, you know exactly what I mean. Now imagine that similar ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are changing at an exponential rate and you can understand why we‚Äôre so stressed to try and keep up.
  
So what am I getting at?  
Simply don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself, because you are already dealing with so much more than anyone before you could ever understand. I mean, come on, even the astrophysicists don‚Äôt have it figured out yet lol!  
  
Take the time to figure out what you want and need out of life and let that be your foundation rather than trying to build off of everyone else‚Äôs unrealistic expectations. We got this!"

It's about the fact that out of the 4 billion female humans currently existing on this planet, not a SINGLE one has ever found you attractive.

It's about the fact that no girl has ever smiled while looking at your picture. It's about the fact that no girl felt a small flutter in her chest while interacting with you. It's about the fact that no girl will ever imagine your hand wrapped around hers. It's about that no girl has ever spent an hour anxiously waiting for you to reply to her text. 

People will say ""Romantic relationships aren't that important!"" when in fact, **they are.** Because if they weren't, most people would be voluntarily single their entire lives and you and I probably wouldn't have even been born.

Teenagers date. Old people (60+) date. Even a lot of **asexual** people date. 

Go read a book. Watch a movie. Listen to a song. What are they usually about? Romance. The oldest love poem actually dates back to [Ancient Mesopotania.](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/750/the-worlds-oldest-love-poem/)

idk, all i see is people above 40 protesting and look back on any revolutionary movement, it‚Äôs always been the youngest generation leading the cause at that time. Look at the 70‚Äôs there were groups of peaceful protests and also groups of private militias because the police were protecting the people with money and not the general population. This is what not caring about what‚Äôs going on around you leads to, people end up having to defend themselves and create private militias to protect their communities. 

I feel like the need to be nonchalant and doing stuff solely for social media has rotted people‚Äôs brains to the point where they think this is going to end and someone else is magically going to swoop in and fix this. when in reality none of us are showing up tells people that we are okay with this. cuts to college loans and programs that help students, my monthly payments went from $20 a month to $600 minimum.

GenZ,Dating/Height Preferences: What causes them?,97,2025-04-27 05:13:12,260,"I've seen a recent post claiming that men are ""actually mad at the patriarchy,"" that aesthetic preferences would not exist in a vacuum, and that most people don't actually care about height or attractiveness in dating.

I wanted to look into whether this was true. How inherent are height and aesthetic preferences in dating? Does it even exist?

Most judgements on dating apps are snap decisions made within seconds, although if someone passes the basal attractiveness threshold, then there may be further examination, such as of their bio. [Women are also several times more selective than men in swiping.](https://mazeoflove.com/tinder/) (over 10 times higher!)

The post also claimed things such as ""height"" were simply a patriarchal standard that men held other men to. For me, common sense and basic life experiences dictate this isn't true, but to be rigorous, all academic literature is incredibly consistent in that both women have a strong height preference for men significantly taller than them (i.e. more than the average male-female difference), and that women have far stronger preferences for height than men.

[See here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0054186) \- we expect 2% of couples to have a taller female by random chance, but in reality, it's closer to 0.14% (14x lower!)

[Women typically prefer men 25cm (10in) taller than themselves, men typically chose women 7cm (3in) shorter than themself](https://www.gertstulp.com/pdf/Stulp%20et%20al%202013_Anim%20Behav_The%20height%20of%20choosiness.pdf)

So not only do we have consistent evidence that there exist significant height preferences in dating, but also, if height preference¬†*was*¬†due to patriarchy, we would observe a similar height preference (due to expectations for male masculinity and female femininity).

Over the past six decades in the West, we've seen social movements that shifted traditional norms, the internet, and alongside the latter, online dating. ""Patriarchy"" has only¬†*declined*¬†in prominence during that time. It could be an interplay of factors (like patriarchal standards being realized in dating due to apps), but it's definitely false that these preferences just outright ""don't exist,"" and constant denialism doesn't help.

I filled my vehicle today and the teen on the other side of the gas pump just pulled the nosle out of his vehicle while still holding the handle causing gast to hit his car and his pants. He then just got in his car just acting like nothing happened. 

I kid you fucking not. I then looked at the pump that was in the same lane but down a row. Another teen kept hitting buttons and then just dispensing gas on the ground see if it worked. Then he put it in the car and after 5 seconds, I assume he ""thought"" nothing was coming out. So he to pulled it out of the vehicle spraying his vehicle, his pants, and a large pool on the ground. This one was happening in slow motion and his reaction was like it was normal. Because he then started hitting buttons again on the pump and hit his car. I finally yelled, ""what the FUCK are you doing"" but he to just got in the car. 

If this is some TICTOC trend, I swear to God. 

All that to say, I really believe this was not for some video and these kids just literally did not have their parents teach them any life skills. Seriously, put some time in teaching some core skills. "

Each word from you, a gentle flame,

But now I know what I‚Äôve missed so long,
A place where I don‚Äôt quite belong.

Still I stand, where shadows grow,
With love you‚Äôll never get to know.

I am just telling you right now if your happiness is solely based on having partners or not then your relationship won't last long anyway.

How can you mantain a meaningful relationship if you can't even be happy without partners. It just common sense that if you can't make yourself happy what make you think you can make other happy? Relationship aren't free happiness card. It is a commitment to make other happy, something a lot of you guy seem to be forgetting. 

Instead of trying to find partners. Focus on try to make yourself happy first. Find a hobby, go excercise. Make new friend or hang out with old friend.

I started college last August and decided I wasn't going to try and find anybody. I needed to have a better sense of myself and better communication skills. And of course, those things are going to *have* to get better once I get into a relationship... but you gotta start somewhere. So I just focused on making my social network, had a few different interests I'm active with. Got all my work done, that sort of thing. 

So honestly I'm glad I didn't try and find a relationship. I think I'd have probably caused a lot more problems that way, and I'm still mostly happy with where my life is right now. 

I don't really know when I'll try, actively. Probably in a few months. I've got the summer to get ready."
GenZ,Is anyone else grieving the future they thought they‚Äôd have?,978,2025-04-26 03:11:08,186,"I 22f can barely afford rent. Buying a home? Not even on the radar. Everything is just so fucking expensive, and honestly, the state of the world makes me feel sick.

It feels like our laws don‚Äôt matter anymore. The U.S. keeps starting or funding wars, backing genocides, hurting the most vulnerable people. Climate change is getting worse. The economy‚Äôs trash. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs always another crisis waiting to drop.

I‚Äôve accepted that we have to work 3x harder than our parents just to survive. I‚Äôve accepted that being a POC in this world means carrying even more weight. But what‚Äôs been quietly breaking me is realizing that I might never be in the right place, financially, emotionally, mentally, to be a parent.

And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really been messing me up.

I grew up thinking that if I just worked hard, got good grades, stayed out of trouble, I‚Äôd eventually get there. I imagined having a home, a partner, a family. I imagined being a parent. That was the dream. And now I feel fucking robbed, because Ik I‚Äôll nvr be selfish enough to have a family I can‚Äôt care for. 

I would be okay with renting forever,  not having much to spend on me, or no vacation, but we can‚Äôt even get that anymore. 

Anyone else feel this way too?

GenZ,Does anyone miss the 2010s music era?,9,2025-04-27 03:11:30,15,"I really miss the 2010s music era. When I was a kid, I listened to party and club music. Artist like Justin Bieber, Pitbull, Rihanna, Usher. Songs like Dynamite, Break Your Heart, Beauty and a Beat, Give Me Everything, Wild Ones, Rude, Cheerleader. I miss that energy so much.

Music today is just depressing. It's all about sadness and mental health. I get that those topics are important, but when I was younger, I thought my teen years would be full of party anthems and club hits. Now when I turn on the radio, it is all autotune, robotic-sounding stuff that feels lifeless.

Same thing with celebrities. I miss the Disney, Nickelodeon era of actors and singers like Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber. People who actually had to work their way up. Now it feels like most new celebrities are pure nepotism.

Like when I see female artists today, like Sabrina Carpenter and Tate McRae, there constantly sexualizing themselves to promote their music. I get that sex sells, but it pisses me off.

I don't know where music is headed anymore. There is still  good music that comes out, but most of it feels like it is made for TikTok and social media trends, not out of real passion."

This includes friendships, dating and life in general.

In terms of friendships, I am doing my best to make new friends all the time, after COVID, all my friends I use to talk to pre-COVID kinda just went their own way.

In terms of dating, I cared so much about this one and I realized how selfish I was being through out, so now with my therapy, I have given up on trying to find someone. To be more clear I am learning to not care and learn to continue to live my life and if it happens it happens. I quit on caring on find someone, learning to be more patient.

In terms of life, I have my own place now and have picked up many hobbies including traveling. Every year I get to travel to countries in Europe and Asia, planning to go to Australia this year or next year for sure. 

I wanted to provide context so what advice you have for me from one GenZ to another?

TLDR: Got an amazing career and education, however lacking in social areas and wanted advice from another GenZ.

GenZ,Do you want Women? I'll tell you how to get them.,0,2025-04-27 22:53:53,77,"Don't try to get them. Its honestly that simple. Focus on yourself and your grind. Make your own life better, get hobbies you actually enjoy. Only once you've built a life worth living, that can stand on its own, will you notice women's attention shift your way. No woman anywhere wants a guy who will live for her, its extremely unattractive. They want a man who has built his own world that he enjoys, and then they will get into a relationship with you to experience that life and be with the caliber of man who built it. Look at the great men throughout history who built our world and civilization. Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon, Alexander the Great. How many of them are known for their women and their relationships? None. You are a man, your life does not REVOLVE around women. Your job is to seek greatness, it is a woman's job to be a homemaker and a nurturer. Build a ""home"" she wants to be apart of.

  
This is reddit so I'm sure a lot of people will disagree and downvote, but i'm telling you, if you follow this advice, you will succeed. It is inevitable. "

I had my Bi awakening about 7-8 months back. Now, I have a particular taste in guys. And in my hostel building there's this guy, who is exactly my type. I mean perfect for me. Now, i don't know much about him. But last year in December we talked a couple of times as we both go to library. I made a similar post then and somehow he got to know about it. And he dmed me on reddit but ig he wasn't interested much. Eventually he ghosted me but damn God, he looks so fucking cute üòç ü§ß üò´  i mean how can someone look like that????? He's like a twinky tall guy straight from a manga. His voice, soft like a cuckoo, I could literally listen him all fucking day. Last weekend, he wore a beanie and he has long hair, pretty long and man I am not able to express in words how good he looked. He sits with his friend and together they were laughing and all and he looked so cute. I saw him today morning during breakfast. I legit felt good üò≠üò≠ 


Although, I feel all this about him, he ghosted me so it doesn't matter tbh. But i couldn‚Äôt keep it in myself. Wanted to express myself. Girls in my colleges are pretty good tbh and in school i had for all 12 years 2 crushes and one relationship/situationship but here everygirl i see i like them for one sec and move on but him, he's my only constant in last 6-7 months. I like want to hold hands with him, talk with him all day, kiss him, hug him ü§ó ‚ù§Ô∏è but alas not happening. üòïüòïüòï  so seeing him makes me a little happy, feels good but never getting to talk makes me a little sad too "

I will keep my observation very simple, you are Russia on the western front or at the very least that's the active direction you're heading in. Innocents getting handed out cruel punishments without due process, protests being made illegal, arrests made on bogus grounds, constant propaganda, full force unitary executive theory, the oppression of minorities and countless more factors at play. 

The only thing I'm wondering is if you still have hope for your country? Do you still believe there's a way to create a free state that treats its people equally and respectfully?

GenZ,The Incoming Fall Of America,0,2025-04-27 10:08:19,53,"Hi guys and gals and NB's!

There's been endless talk about tariffs and other political going on's. The stock market crash. The crypto scams run by the president and insider trading over the tariffs timings.

The deportation of American citizens being shipped to 3rd world slave labor prison camps ( without due process ). The arrest of judges trying to install fear into the state's independent judicial apparatus. School shootings by brain broken Maga fanatics.

What I'd like to hear from you about is the economic side of this.

I keep seeing Americans not understanding what has happened with their economy fully in a lot of discussion.

You are in a recession. 1000 %. You are in the next great depression. China accounts for over 30 % of all incoming goods in your country. They have paused almost all trade. All rare earths. Critical supplies for the majority of your industries. Then there is the finished goods and services, that places like Amazon directly import.

Watching everyone on reddit talk about the state of the world, the economy, there is this fascinating sense of watching people not understand the severity of the impact, of what is happening and is about to happen

The world has moved on from you. All your trading partners are now in private negotiations with one another and forming new trading blocks and filling in each other's gaps that the hole of American trade has left. This includes major multi billion dollar contracts that go to your military industrial complex. When the world doesnt even want to buy your weapons, because you have firmware that can remotely turn off our missle systems , no one is willing to rely on that technology anymore

You have demonstrated, that every 4 years, your country is now so unstable and untrustworthy, that the people can and will elect the most unstable, dishonest, uneducated, ideologically fascist , rights abusing fascists candidates that you can manage to put forward. NO COUNTRY on the planet, is willing to base their military defense systems, their raw earth supply chains, their technological systems or their food , on places with such instability or lack of regulation.

Here's whats going to happen to America now. The earthquake of trumpism economics hit the world. It hit america... This is like watching a japanese earthquake IRL. Earthquakes are silent in the sea. The water is retreating from the coast line. And you are all standing on the beach with this dumb look at the sea ""would yah look at that!"" not realizing what this means. There is a TSUNAMI of economic damage coming for you.

China has won a global super power war by doing NOTHING. They were not and are not the enemy. You offshore handed them global manufacturing and they used socialism as means to reach peaceful communism, as a mechanism to enrich their people and their quality of life. Rather than have a few hundred billionaires pocket all of the profits.

Here's your short term future -

1. Your tourism industry is in a free fall collapse right now
2. China ceasing trade causes more economic stock market crashes.
3. Your port's have mass layoffs as there is no longer shipping containers coming in at the volume as demand.
4. Your trucking industry collapse with your ports industries and shipping industries.
5. Your major import driven business's face economic down turns and closures, solidifying monopolization over what's left of your corporations
6. Your exports slow down dramatically once the clown show finally decides what each countries tariffs are, as every other country placed / places reciprocal tariffs on your country in kind.
7. Amazon lays off hundreds of thousands of employees due to no stock and tariffs.
8. The gig economy implodes due to lack of jobs and consumer trust.
9. Treasury bonds are exited at a rate that demonstrates global lack of confidence in the U.S as a reserve currency
10. Rampant inflation hits as the FED is forced to over print money to cover the interest on the national debt
11. PURE recession hits at this point. Think, government cheese and bread lines of the 1900's.
12. Civil unrest is coming in waves over each of these steps.

I could speculate further but I think its important to note that at this phase of reactions to what has happened you are hit with the ""Tsunami"". The clear and obvious reaction to something that happened 3 - 6 months prior.

That's the thing with what's happening. I think a lot of Americans are not understanding that all of these decisions have very tangible real world consequences, but that the effects of these consequences have delayed visual responses.

As you see these steps and other very obvious demonstration's of warning signs of what's to come, remember these are delayed reactions and there are more and more earthquakes happening right now.

I thought it would be prudent to at least share this basic knowledge in the face of so many people's lack of awareness. I'd really like to hear how this generation is feeling about this. What this generation is going to do about this.

You have been conditioned to feel like you have NO POWER. You have all the power. You are the consumer. The worker. The youth. The country literally stops and turns at your united leisure and whims. You can kick this political institution out at any time. You can rework your stance on capitalism at any time. You can rework your democracy at any time.

They want you to be doomers and feel powerless. This is the most exciting time to be alive in history . For the first time in global civil conflicts, we can all talk to one another and see each other as fellow humans. Rather than have newspapers and radio repeat government approved propaganda to force conscription to go fight a war on some other persons land. You can just talk to those people in that land. And see.... We are all in the same war

GenZ,"Do you think the idea that ""as long you have a degree, you'll be fine"" is no longer true for Gen Zers?",105,2025-04-25 22:28:31,105,"There seems to be this sentiment, especially from the older generations, that a university degree opens up tons of doors, and that unless you go to school for something specific like engineering or finance, your major is pretty much irrelevant, and you can find gainful employment as long as you have a degree. But I'm beginning to question if this is really true. 

I have a social science degree and pretty much job I come across on indeed wants a degree from a specific field (often relating to fields like accounting, business, etc), or they want a masters/PhD, OR they want 5 years of experience.

It's mostly my boomer and gen x relatives who keep telling me this, and it might've been true that in the 80s/90s, yeah as long as you had a degree you were fine, but times have changed.

As much as I WANT this to be true, I'm beginning to doubt that it is. I feel like BAs are becoming the new high school diplomas, and unless your BA teaches you tangible employable skills you might be SOL. 

Maybe I'm just being too pessimistic, though. What do you guys think? I'd love to hear stories of gen zers with ""useless"" degrees who still managed to get a decent job because I'm beginning to think I might need to go back to school and get a finance or law degree or something if I don't want to be making minimum wage for the rest of my life "

So, how much of this education do we use in daily life? Is it a lie? What are we doing with ourselves? What does it mean to be educated anymore? Do you just stop informing yourself once you graduate high school or college? Does your pursuit of a higher education mean you‚Äôre more intelligent than before? I don‚Äôt know your grades, or test scores, so anyone could say their degrees mean something. ‚ÄúCs still get degrees,‚Äù remember that?

I used to want to be a graphic artist, but I steered clear at the last minute to pursue a biological anthropology degree, and now I‚Äôm in healthcare.

I currently have Bumble, Hinge, & Match. My first question: Is there a more laid back dating app for those that are less social? Or maybe it‚Äôs just me. I ask that because nearly every female profile I see is the following: Travel, Concerts, Festivals, & Exploring New Cities (which just feels like traveling said differently üòÇ). Which is clearly not me, and more often than not I end up swiping left because why waste your time and mine right?

Second question: Are people‚Äôs profiles usually more interesting than they actually are? I haven‚Äôt gone on a date yet so I obviously can‚Äôt say üòÇ. I would say mine is accurate which might explain the lack of interaction, but I could also just suck at taking photos‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also been told since childhood that I have an ‚Äòold soul‚Äô for whatever that‚Äôs worth ü§î‚Ä¶ Should I be shooting my shot at a nursing home or assistant living facility? ü§£

Brief overview of profile if it helps:
28(M) & no I don‚Äôt have kids.
Interests: Anime, Movies, Horror, Museums/Art, Music, Video games, Free-writing.
Dating Range: 24-48.
Dealbreaker: Has kids/Wants kids.

GenZ,"For Gen-Z men and women who are leaning more towards religion, why? What is the draw?",59,2025-04-25 16:57:43,253,"As someone who was raised religious, but not evangelical or anything, I found being religious to be super stressful. Especially in my early teen years when I was having *so much* cognitive dissonance trying to convince myself that what I was taught was true, when I very obviously was finding things that didn‚Äôt make sense to me. 

When I finally let go of religion and became agnostic, I felt freed. I can now live by my own terms and rules and nobody is telling me I‚Äôm a bad person just because I‚Äôm a human. I can figure out what I want for my life fully for myself. 

So, why are you guys leaning more towards religion if you have chosen that path? I know it does give some people a path and help bring clarity. Also, I am an elder gen-z at 24 so perhaps I‚Äôm just not connected to what the younger end of gen-z finds important. "

For the sake of argument let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm relatively handsome (well mom n grandma think so) and I actually am athletically inclined so just getting the ‚Äúrule 1 and rule 2‚Äù thing out of the way..

How does one proceed now? Where do I go? I‚Äôm never gonna hit on my female friends (coz i value that friendship more) and asking strangers out at a bar just feels weird like what do you even talk about with a stranger?

Plus I think I have this tendency to be super friendly so I cannot flirt/ escalate I feel.

And even if I do manage to get a date with said stranger‚Ä¶ do I tell her I don‚Äôt want anything serious right there? Or on the actual first date?

I‚Äôve noticed a shift recently on Reddit, Reels, TikTok, and Shorts where the content is getting aggressively anti-Millennial. There was a ‚ÄúBitter Reddit Millennial starterpack‚Äù yesterday on r/starterpacks that was crazy negative. I also saw a Millennial Squidward Short on YouTube where he destroys a nice, vintage home and makes it ‚Äútrendy‚Äù. 

Before the memes were like, ‚ÄúMillennials wear no-show socks and have no fashion sense‚Äù. Now they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúMillennials are horrible and destroying society‚Äù.

Idk, it just feels weird. I‚Äôm friends with some older Gen Z, and I‚Äôve had coworkers who are younger Gen Z and we‚Äôve gotten along great. The hate feels out of nowhere for me.

So, I just wanted to get your guys‚Äô opinion. Does Gen Z actually hate Millennials? Am I being a try hard snowflake that needs to be loved by the youth?

GenZ,AI Is Ruining Younger Gen Z,129,2025-04-25 06:41:08,54,"For context, I went to an AI philosophy lecture about whether neural networks have souls(surprise surprise...they don't) as a an extra credit assignment for one of my gen-ed classes about intelligence. 

The lecturer was a catholic theologian so I didn't expect much but his argument ended up being the typical arguments about how there's no true communicative intent behind the words and how the words, calculations, sentences, etc it chooses are based on extremely computationally expensive statistics at the end of the day. And some stuff about abstraction and immateriality that got long-winded. Conclusion was that AI shouldn't make critical decisions for us. Overall made sense.

First student in the Q&A section objected to him arguing that AI can ACTUALLY THINK now due to the THINKING feature on the new AIs, and that the pictures it generates are extremely nuanced and complex therefore they actually have real understanding.

Bruh.

Am I going crazy over here? I have used so much AI since the advent of gpt in 2022 and I have not once thought it was real human intelligence.

Professor gave a long winded philosophical rebuttal, I got kind of frustrated so i raised my hand and explained quickly that the thinking feature is not actually thinking but a metaphor for adding extra conditions and steps that betters outputs of an AI... still computational and extremely complex statistics at the end kf the day. It's not LITERALLY thinking.

Next two questions were about who's responsible for the actions of an ""extremely smart and deep AI"", and another question about how advanced the image generation is and why that wouldn't be considered real intelligence.

It really seemed like some of the students missed the point here. I really expected more questions about how we can move forward positively with AI rather than negatively, stuff like that.

AI research is still in the rich investors best interests right now, as well as megacorporations. Profits are the motive at the end of the day. Huge water and carbon impact. Critical thinking skills going down. We humans are very easily manipulated, even the 1966 language system ELIZA had people trusting it super easily. Combine that with corporate propaganda... and yeah more and more people are thinking AI is amazing, which it is, but then they go a step beyond that and think it's actual intelligence. That's scary to me.

This whole experience makes me want to use AI much less now.

What do you guys think? Is AI screwing us? If so what ways? Economically? Pedagogically? Generationally? Everything?"
GenZ,Why is our generation so social online but wallflowers in person?,12,2025-04-25 18:22:40,8,"I know, I know, I don't want to paint us all with the same brush. I'm sure there's people that don't subscribe to the ""social recluse"" stereotype of us.

I just noticed how, even when making friends, I notice most of my friends aren't even Gen Z.
I think it's important to at least have one good friend in your age group going through a similar life stage, but it's so hard to make friends in the 20-25 age range recently.

If I didn't count people from other generations as possible of being friends with, I'd have 0 friends.

There's so much fear surrounding everyday interaction socially in this generation. 

Personally, I'm not afraid to make small talk with the cashier. 

I'm not afraid to call and make an appointment with a doctor. 

I'm not afraid to stop and ask for directions. 

I know there's definitely some people my age (24) who are still afraid of things you definitely should know before you move out on your own.

Some things might be trust issues, some people operate as if you have one chance and if you mess it up, the friendship is over, or they'll quietly ghost you, which is more cowardly and hurtful than having a real conversation about ending a friendship.

It can't all be because of the pandemic, can it?
Or the long-term effects of social media?

When I was taking a class in college, all the friendships I made were from me doing the initial approach, anyone who looked relatively my age were just to themselves, with earbuds in, looking down at their phones. 
If I never said hi or walked up to them, we would have never been friends.

I don't know if we just judge a lot based on first impression or maybe there's just like a risk/reward metric when it comes to being social with people that's like, ""Is the risk of offending someone or looking cringe lower than the reward of making a new friend or person to network with professionally?""

They were happy to be my friend but it was me who had to take the initial step, no one seemed very open towards connecting with people.

Even in public, it's just, people walking by, avoiding eye contact, looking at their phones, listening to music.

I don't really see many Gen Z young adult friend groups hanging out at all, I'll see the typical pod of teenagers hanging out, adults in their 30s having some camaraderie, families with their children.

What happened to us, and is it fixable?
Is it how our parents parented us that made us so risk-averse?

Maybe the first step is not being so glued to phones. There is no lockdown anymore so it's not like we need to stay 6 feet apart socially?

Will this subside with time or will we just keep being individualistic?"

GenZ,Is a Fear of Failure Real for GenZ?,27,2025-04-25 12:17:35,27,"In my time interacting with GenZ I‚Äôve come to find that the biggest flaw GenZ has is they have a fear of failure on a level far beyond what I see in other generation.

Many times I‚Äôve seen someone GenZ age give up on something at the first sign of adversity or not even try at all. Older generations will say it‚Äôs ‚Äúlaziness.‚Äù However, I never really bought that explanation. It felt like that explanation was actually what was lazy. I decided to take a hard think about why this seems to be the case.

The conclusion I came to was that GenZ isn‚Äôt afraid of hard work or anything they‚Äôre accused of. In fact, many of them are the hardest working people I know. The actual problem, as far as I can tell, is that GenZ is simply horrified of failure. Externally, this appears as ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù to older people (hence the GenZ stereotypes), but is a separate issue entirely.

This to me actually makes sense though. The consequences of failure (or perceived consequences of failure) are higher. With increased cost of living and stagnant wages the financial cost of failure is higher for young people than ever before. With social media people‚Äôs failures can be put on blast with thousands of strangers dragging them through the mud online. With the age of information, people feel they have less of an excuse to be unknowledgeable and therefore have an aversion to behaviors that can make them appear that way. Sometimes, it‚Äôs simply that GenZ age people have been afforded less opportunities than others to fail and grow from their failures in their formative years, leaving them without the ability to be comfortable in new, unknown situations.

Discussion/TL;DR: Do you guys feel this an accurate description for GenZ? If so, how can we as a generation overcome this so we have a better chance to grow and become successful?

*Disclaimer: I am also GenZ but as an elder GenZ I find I generally relate to millennials more in certain regards. This topic is one of them. Hence the third person language I use.*"
GenZ,Dating scene for Gen z is so absurd,437,2025-04-24 19:54:44,785,"Bruh for Gen z dudes dating is so ridiculous, at least in the U.S. I'm 25- and somehow still a KHHV. I've used every avenue of approach, including way too much tinder/bumble/hinge. I keep wanting to give up on those but when I get rejected irl I can't help but turn to them. 

All I really look for in a girl is that she be around my age and not too overweight. I'm slim and fit so that feels like a reasonable ask. I guess there are some girls who meet that who I wouldn't date but they're so rare I haven't met one irl that I can think of. 

And all this not to mention that once you do get a drop of water in this desert, there's no guarantee it won't be poison...

Along with apathy, many articles label the Gen Z generation, as ""unmotivated, disengaged, disinterested in education, friendships, work, family life, and relationships."" 

What I'm interested in learning is whether Gen Z-ers (at least within Reddit) feel that, in general, their peers, and perhaps themselves, are apathetic, or whether that label is incorrect. Possibly, it might be true in one area of their lives and not others. 

For context: I'm a female in her forties who never had kids. My family and friends consist of Milennials through Boomers who enjoy complaining about younger people, without asking the opinions of younger people. I've often asked myself how much of these older generations' opinions have validity.

I do them just because.

Whenever I try to volunteer something or attend something, an inner voice keeps saying youre too old for this.

I feel I haven't achieved enough for a 22 year old but ye sadder thing is I know I might not achieve them even when I'm 32.

It's not like I'm alone or don't have friends. Although I am chronically single, im grateful that I have friends and family who love me a lot. At dot 12 am my family called me in a group vc. My friends called and will be ready to celebrate my birthday with utmost love and enthusiasm. I know I'm the pillar of my friends and family. But deep I feel alone. Very alone.

I've been worse the last couple years, but the growth I've had isn't enough. I now know what's good and wrong for me but I dont implement it. I stopped doing the wrong but haven't started doing the right.

Those fictional works often feature some sorts of human relationships. When I look at booktok alone and especially the girls who talk about books they mostly read romance novels with different genres like you have the fantasy romance novel the one in a science fiction setting etc. I think most people can't deal with the real world anymore and escape into fictional worlds of all sorts. I dont think it will get better it will get worse when we have good enough A.I. chatbots we probably end up like in the movie Her where a guy falls on love with his A.I. assistant. If they get advanced enough people will go to those A.I. Chatbots to get their human connections and if we each the point we build realistic artificial body's for the advanced chatbots who can afford it will simply buy themselves a partner or even whole family. Like you could buy android children and every couple of years to simulate growth they get a new body if you want of course you also would have your 5 year old looking android daughter for eternity. Of course I don't know how realistic all this is and if I even see it in my lifetime but I think that where we heading I think the advanced A.I. chatbots indistinguishable from humans I will see.

GenZ,Genz Women and their fear of Marriage,481,2025-04-24 12:24:39,431,"I see so many posts about how women have gained so much independence and clarity in recent years that they‚Äôre not as open to the concept of marriage. My little brother brought this up the other day, and in explaining my thought on it to him, I realized something. 

This is a generalization, and my own experience of course, but I think it still applies and I‚Äôm curious to see how many women (or men!) agree to this. 

I grew up with a mom who worked just as hard as my dad, (actually made more money than him and worked longer hours), but regardless, she came home and did ALL of the housework, pretty much all of the childcare too. Maybe back in the day, women would grow up and see their moms doing all of this housework and assume the role in their own marriages without much thought. Kind of like how men grow up, seeing the sacrifices their mom‚Äôs make for them, and expect the same out of their future wives. 

But I think moms can have a tendency to favor their sons, and try to keep their true feelings on the matter to themselves. Or, as I‚Äôm realizing, to their daughters. 

Because I know so many women who grew up watching their mother‚Äôs slave away. Listening to them beg for their daughters not to settle, not to have kids too soon, not to skip out on their education. To do anything to avoid the same fate. 

It‚Äôs certainly shaped my outlook on life, and apparently, a lot of the women our age too. 

My brother‚Äôs views on our upbringing are completely different than mine. He saw a woman who worked hard and made our dad‚Äôs life easier. I saw a woman who was severely unhappy and trapped in a life she had no idea how to fix. Now my brother (also gen z by the way), is shocked and put off by the fact that no woman is willing to make those same sacrifices for him that our mom made for our dad.

All to say, go and show your mothers some love, first and foremost. 

But the fears Gen z women (and some men) have over marriage isn‚Äôt baseless. And while there‚Äôs certainly tons of other disconnect between genders right now, one things for certain. We can‚Äôt keep the expectations of marriage that our parents have clung too, from years and years ago when the men took on the jobs so the women had all of their time and energy to dedicate to the home and the child rearing. We all have jobs now, sucky ones. We‚Äôre all just as tired to come home and have to take care of ourselves and our significant others. (I don‚Äôt know how those of you with kids do it, but you amaze me lol)

GenZ,People get so weird talking about college and trade school,18,2025-04-25 01:04:44,19,"I feel like this hits me especially hard, because one half of my family is nearly entirely engineers, my mom went to med school, and my dad's whole family are carpenters or electricians. 

There's a really big push these days about questioning the value of college. It's really fucking expensive, and it takes a lot of time, and plenty of people basically just get told they *have* to go regardless of their own plans in life. 

It's just, a lot of people seem to get this weird complex about trade school and other two-year programs. I can't really describe it, but they just talk about them like they're these secret passages to *subvert* the colleges or something. 

But like, they're *literally just a job*. Ideologically, going into trades is the same thing as something like engineering, the difference is just what you're being trained in. Lots of college degrees functionally just give you a toolbox of things, the same way becoming a mechanic or carpenter or plumber or electrician gives you a (often literal) toolbox. Now, it's definitely different from like, a liberal arts degree, and I'll give you that. But I've always been struck with how fundamentally similar a lot of it is.

And they're good jobs that make good money. They'll have you set, if that's what you want to do. But don't look at them as some mystic secret. They're just another way to have qualifications. "

This setup would allow people to hold a long-term lease of a part of land owned by the non-profit. Individuals and families will be able to build equity in improvements on their leased land while ensuring the land is continuously used for the non-profit mission of sustainability and affordable housing. I also imagine communal recreational areas and gardens where responsibilities and harvests are shared. 


Right now, I am just a person with a dream and a potential source of a ~$50,000 donation. I truly do believe in this way of life and hope to utilize grants and donations to make this dream a reality for people who are often priced out of these communities. The LGBTQ+ community has been a safe and welcoming space for me and I‚Äôd like to help create a safe and welcoming space to give back. 


I need as much help to make this a reality as y‚Äôall are willing to give. Hit me with your knowledge, wisdom, advice, successes, fails, things you wish you‚Äôd considered along the way. If anyone is willing to be a more long-term mentor, that would be much appreciated. 


I am also looking for 4-6 likeminded individuals or families who are willing to put in the work with me to make this a reality for ourselves and others. While the financial burden for a setup like this is lower, we will need to spend much more time applying for grants, fundraising, and ensuring we‚Äôre compliant with federal non-profit regulations.

She was 23 and said she was lazy and that means unambitious and I didn't like that she smokes. It unfortunately wasn't someone I could see a potential future with.

I had an online final for one of my classes, we were given 24 hours to actually take it online, however I missed the window.

Why? Because all my attention was focused on another class that i found way more intensive and important, which caused me to go 42 hours without sleep in order to study for that exam. On my way home, I was literally micro sleeping and swerving on the road because my brain kept trying to go to sleep, so when I got home i immediately fell onto my bed at 8, thinking a quick Power Nap would do me good.

I woke up at 2am, 2 hours after the exam had closed. It was honestly the worst feeling I‚Äôve had all semester, which is saying a lot.

I‚Äôm so stupid and idiotic for not just taking it immediately when I got home. I just sent my professor an email, asking for a 1 day online extension so I can take it online like everyone else.

Pray for me guys, pray that my professor can find it in his heart to help me out and give me an extension."

- okay with starting a family at some point

I think it's important that we establish a trusting, healthy relationship, and ensure we both are capable of supporting each other emotionally and financially.

We can start by spreading our buttocks wide and inserting various objects into them as trust exercises, eventually working our way up to cacti and maybe even insects of some sort. Next, we will re-enact the process of creating life by lathering eachother in various condiments and spreading our delicious excrement across the bedsheets. Finally, to truly build our bond with each other, we will dance without cloth to hide our body, in the street, before being dragged away by tired carriages and letting our flayed skin decorate the city with our love. Only then will we truly be engaged."

Pretty much every generation beta that I've met has been a NEET. Most live with their parents - which is fine - but the issue is that they just lounge around all day without contributing to the household even with chores. 

Even despite this, they are also very entitled and lazy, like, demanding their family members bring stuff to them instead of getting it on their own. Plus, I see a lot of them sleep during the entire day but end up being loud as fuck during random times at night.

From what I've experienced, gen beta is also super selfish - like, you'd think they just aren't capable of empathy from the way they act. Weirdly though, they also don't have that much self-respect either. Most of them won't even hold their heads up.

I also just straight up don't understand their slang/language quirks. They just don't communicate well. The other day I was at the grocery store and I saw some Gen Beta girl screaming at the top of her lungs in public. MF wasn't even saying what was wrong, just complaining for the sake of it idk.

GenZ,Indeed. Biggest root cause of misogyny of young men is misandry they see online,0,2025-04-25 06:22:09,48,"This was told a while ago here and claim was met with skepticism, as it was not proven by any sources, just anecdotal.  So I made a small research and figured out why some men are holding negative views towards women.

Indeed - their experiences online are the leading cause. Experiences with women IRL are close second. It is difficult to say who was in the wrong when a man and a woman who know each other offline feel pissed by each other.

However online is different. A tiny ratio of toxic women: entitled tiktok princesses and misandrist ""scholars"" or ""activists"" can produce content, that is magnified x1000 by the internet. Ragebait works. Media algorithms are working on reactions of users, reposts, which are fueled by emotions and hate is the strongest emotion.

It is relatively safe to poke men into eyes online, because misandry is widely not recognized as a big problem. Men saying similar things about women would end up in trouble. Women just get more views, reposts and  monetization.

This leads to a tiny fraction of toxic women to be over-represented in the web. For young men whose communication with women offline is very limited - this minority of toxic women becomes the representation of women as a group. And this way misandry fuels misogyny.

Last time people tried to interpret it as blaming victim, blaming women for misogyny. But come on, a tiny fraction of women is spreading misandry online, while much larger group of (other) women are affected by resulting backlash.

A lot of people say that misandry is sort of justified because some men rape women and act like AHs towards women. Isn't it same?

Also note that convenient politically correct explanation of men being indoctrinated by other patriarchal men is the least important. Male grifters, eeeevil manosphere, lingering patriarchy are the tiniest contributor to overall misogyny."

I mean, sure, people do hate the Pauls ‚Äî don't get me wrong ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not that universal, red-hot, foaming-at-the-mouth loathing Bieber got. He was the punchline. You couldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúJustin Bieber‚Äù in a middle school hallway without someone screaming ‚ÄúHE SOUNDS LIKE A GIRL‚Äù like it was a national emergency. People would casually talk about wanting to kill him, you NEVER saw this with the Pauls.

Look at the comments from this video:

[Justin Bieber gets shot on CSI Special Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36RTvZ8NjUQ)

They're from 2021, celebrating it. I thought everyone moved on to hating the Pauls... guess not. Why did they seemingly get a pass despite being much more obnoxious?"

GenZ,What is with Gen z and having this mentality?,124,2025-04-23 20:47:52,51,"Just because you haven't been discriminated in a certain way doesn't mean that others haven't. 

I almost want to blame social media because it's given people a platform to feel like they're the most important person in the world and that their word is law. 

But honestly I feel like this is always been a people thing. It's just more exposed now than ever. 

But our generation needs to help break this mindset! 

No you may have not been affected by whatever law change or discrimination but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. 

Our generation needs to have more empathy for others. Even people who *gasp* DISAGREES WITH YOU???...yes. obviously. "
GenZ,"I‚Äôm 25, lost, angry, severely depressed,envious, tired, and just done with life. Whats the purpose? Has anyone else been lost like this? I basically lost all faith/hope",80,2025-04-23 22:38:05,47,"
I‚Äôm a young tow truck driver, and I kinda hate the job but it‚Äôs the only job i‚Äôve ever had and i‚Äôm tired of driving trucks. I had a co worker he was hit a and killed at my 2nd company, and that really affected me. It made me look at life differently. The job just makes me even more depressed. I also have a CDL-A, but zero experience with it. Soon as I got it, I started doing non cdl driving. People keep telling me I should start driving over the road, but I know I would hate it. I‚Äôd fucking kill myself being trapped in a damn truck for weeks. I want to find another non cdl job. Something I could use the tow truck driving experience with, but no luck.

Been sorta unemployed for months. My depression has gotten 5x worse. I ended up getting fired at my 2nd company a few months ago. I recently went back to my 1st company(way smaller company btw), but my truck broke down within 2 days, so once again i‚Äôm not working. Also my dad was arrested my first fucking day at work. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I dont know what i‚Äôm doing here in life. I hate being this way. I promise i‚Äôm not a bad person. I dont know what to do, i‚Äôm so lost in my life and it makes me sad. I wish I was someone else . I know this is all over the place, i‚Äôm just so damn lost.

I‚Äôm just so tired of suffering. I‚Äôve been severely depressed with suicidal thoughts since I was 16, 25 now. I just believe God is against me. I‚Äôm not one of his favorites. Why did he force me to suffer with chronic health issues at such a young age ( 6y/o to 22 y/o) . I had meningitis at the age of 6. I nearly died, but ended up with lifelong symptoms, better now tho.  Why did he give me a toxic family that i‚Äôm forced the live with? ( My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic, father is angry/bitter and loves going back and forth with her crazy ass). They‚Äôve been arguing since before the damn twin towers went down. I hate the fact they‚Äôre my parents. Why has my life been nothing but back to back struggles? Why does he want me to kill myself? I hate my damn life man. Whats the point of this shit? Having faith in a God who‚Äôs ignored me my entire life. If God is real, he fucking hates me, and I hate him too. Everyday, I have to battle suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôm not one of his favorites that he hands out blessings to just for existing. If he exists, he fucking hates me. I just wanna die man

I know this is all over the place, i‚Äôm just so damn lost man. Btw yes i‚Äôm in anti depressants, and yes I tried therapy with multiple different therapists. Haven‚Äôt been since I was 18, and it was pretty useless honestly. That shit ain‚Äôt cheap so whats the point in going back"

GenZ,My Gen Alpha Sister.,0,2025-04-25 00:36:06,3,"I'm the middle child (14F). My brother (18) and my sister (10, almost 11) are both less than productive; they are ADDICTED to electronics. My screen time isn't the best either, but they put it above basic human needs sometimes. But this isn't about both of them; this is about my sister. She's the worst of the two. She takes my mom's iPad without asking constantly to play Roblox with her online friends and CONSTANTLY asks my mom to bring her food and refill her water, and while yes, I know every child is different, I was VERY capable of doing those things, and she's taller than me, so her height isn't an issue. Physically, she can do it just fine; she just refuses to. If it was between getting up and pulling a screen away from her damn face and going to get something to eat or starving but staying to watch whatever brain-rotting YouTube video she has pulled up, she'd pick the video UNLESS IT'S MY FOOD. The number of times she's finished off food my parents buy for ME and she knows is MINE is insane. Our parents usually try and keep one kind of chip we each like in stock so we have our own bag of chips. Yes, we do share, but we always ask and never get the last of the bag. NOT HER. She's finished off my Cheetos hundreds of times, and today she just ate almost a WHOLE BAG OF GOLDFISH that she knew was mine. I had one recommended serving size, and my dad had a handful or two, and she ate it all in one sitting, rotting her brain on my mom's 'stolen' iPad. Am I probably overreacting a little? Yeah, but I've been thinking about those goldfish all evening since I left for my play rehearsal, and I've had a headache the last hour, and I've been having period cramps all day, and I came home to her having eaten the whole bag, which had a lot left, and that CAN'T be healthy for her. If she was that hungry, she should've gotten a little goldfish on the side and something more filling. I'm just so tired of her lately. All she seems to do is be annoying, especially since she started playing 'Dany's World' on Roblox. I swear she's addicted to it. She always says, 'I'm busy' when we ask her to do something while she's playing, like no, you're not busy; you're being an iPad kid. And then she sits there and denies that she's like the other Gen Alpha because she doesn't watch Skibidi Toilet or whatever. I can't even avoid her because we share a room! Part of me wants to help her somehow, but I've been trying for years, and I'm sick of it. I just wish she wasn't so bitchy and constantly doing something she shouldn't. Anyways, if there's anything at all you can tell me, whether it be consolations or advice, anything is appreciated. Thanks for reading."

Listen to advice.,0,2025-04-25 05:42:30,81,"It‚Äôs so infuriating to get on here and see so many people (mostly men) complaining about having never dated or never been liked before, then to see people extend an olive branch to give some advise, only to be responded with ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm shy‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt make that much of an effort‚Äù. Please just look at yourself and think, even if the world is shit and you don‚Äôt like ‚Äúxyz‚Äù thing about the dating pool you still need to be the change you so desperately look for. You really attract what you put out. 

Currently I‚Äôm not looking to be in a romantic relationship, I only really wanted to make friends, and this term I made a bunch of friends who I absolutely adore spending time with and I haven‚Äôt really gotten much interest from potential dates because I don‚Äôt put out that ‚Äúenergy‚Äù. Is it an easy change? Not necessarily, it takes effort. 

I‚Äôve been trying to push myself to be more approachable for over a year now because breaking down those walls takes time. But when I was truly willing and able to be friendly and be receptive, not in a performative way I truly felt like I was able to be open, everything fell into place. Now that I have more friends I have to push away that little voice in my head that tells me that spending time alone is much better. I have to be sure that I truly just want to rest or if it‚Äôs just my ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù mind saying something to get out of going somewhere. 

I know half of the people that post on here just want to be told that they‚Äôre not the problem. That it‚Äôs ‚Äúsociety‚Äù. But we got one life, what else are you gonna do? Sulk? Or change?"

Age discrimination is real. People say email hiring manager, but they just reply ""just apply online dude"". They want 3 years of experience for entry level, but ends up hiring via Nepotism. Bachelor's degree and personal projects mean nothing to them. There's no way to convince them to hire you if they find someone who has experience for low level jobs.

GenZ,The addiction no one talks about....Why we can‚Äôt stop craving approval,6,2025-04-24 07:45:50,7,"why do we need other people to approve of us so badly? Even when we know we should validate ourselves, there‚Äôs still that itch to hear, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI see you, I value you.‚Äù And when we don‚Äôt get it? That doubt creeps in.

It‚Äôs wild when you think about it. Logically, we know external validation shouldn‚Äôt define us. But psychologically? We‚Äôre wired to seek it. Humans are social creatures..our brains are literally designed to seek approval because, for most of human history, survival depended on being accepted by the group. Feeling excluded? That wasn‚Äôt just rejection; that was a death sentence back in the day. So yeah, this runs deep.

But here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. When you rely too much on external validation, you give other people control over how you feel about yourself. If they praise you, you‚Äôre on top of the world. If they don‚Äôt, suddenly you‚Äôre doubting everything. That‚Äôs a dangerous cycle because you end up chasing approval rather than building real self-worth.

Self-validation, on the other hand, is like an internal muscle..you have to strengthen it over time. It‚Äôs about being able to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of myself,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI trust my own judgment,‚Äù without needing a round of applause to confirm it. And the more you do it, the less dependent you become on whether or not people give you that stamp of approval.

Any thoughts?"

The good parts are 1: you start off making 60-70k and VERY quickly rise to 100k. 2:you don't need any education for the career 3: you get HALF THE YEAR OR MORE completely off, during which you can travel the world with your passport.

Obviously it's not perfect. You are gone for multiple months, which has obvious downsides for family and your spouse. Just thought I'd leave this option here because it is something of a hidden career."

Skibidi Toilet is art. This statement sounds absurd, but why wouldn't it be art? It is obviously surreal, but would you say that Salvador Dali didn't make real art?

I see the same shit repeating over and over again, with a young generation getting bullied by their older peers for being stupid, naive or uncultured. Then they grow up and do the same thing to their younger peers.

I really think that this generational divide is the real brain rot and it has plagued humanity since at least the ancient Greeks. It is time to not only respect our elders (who have literally profited from the destruction of this world) but also to respect our youngers, who will take on the responsibility of this world at some point in the future.

I am ashamed to be gen z when I see my peers make fun of gen alpha for Skibidi Toilet.

I've had about 5 partners so far and I can firmly say that the inauthentic way of meetinging people and the fact that we veiw dating profiles as applications and first date and like week or two of talking to the person are basically just interviews. It's toxic and completely removes the human aspect of it. We're not intrigued by the person, but the photos and who they say they are. It's a lot easier to detect a liar in person, it's a lot easier to get a feel for who they are in person. This isn't even mentioning the constant feeling of ""someone better"" because the apps just throw profiles at you and the idea of potential partners is always there.

GenZ,Irony Poisoning Is Ruining Our Generation,55,2025-04-22 17:36:06,35,"So I don't remember where I first got introduced to this, might've been on YouTube or maybe another post here, but I wanted to bring this up on this sub because I feel like I not only see it on TikTok quite a bit, I see it a lot on reddit (and yes this sub as well)

If you don't know what irony poisoning is, it is essentially becoming so deep into ""ironic"" jokes and memes that you start to espouse these views unironically. As an example, I see a first step being the lowkey doomer edits that you see on TikTok. Usually someone walking alone on a road with the cloudy background talking about how hard life is. Then a lot of people will use self-deprecating humor as a kind of irony, and because of how social media algorithms work, they will be shown more and more content like that. After so many times, it doesn't become a joke anymore. It will literally become the person's worldview.

  
When I think about how people in our generation become things like doomers, NEETs, and incels, I think that, generally, irony poisoning is a huge part of the reason why. People are using irony as a shield to not be vulnerable, and all it does is leave the person isolated and alone. I feel like a lot of fringe ideas (mostly around redpill terms such as Alpha Male, Beta Male, etc.) have entered mainstream discussion because of irony poisoning, and we are seeing the effects that this has had on not just our generation, but also on gen alpha as well. Some far-right symbols even started as a result of trolling and irony poisoning (as an example, the ok sign üëå, obviously there is still its original use as well, not trying to claim it is only used that way)

A side note is that we are a generation that is very afraid of being vulnerable, and being seen as cringe. The way we put ""cringy"" behavior on blast and essentially promote bullying means that no one wants to be their authentic selves no more and badly wants to fit into the mold to be accepted. Hell, notice how so many people's fashion styles are literally the same nowadays? Its so boring and again I think a side effect of the amount of irony poisoning. "

Or covid made people unable to find jobs because it made them introverted. Or how covid made people feel self entitled and blame it on covid for making them this way.

It's usually the negative stuff. But I really am quite bewildred, I went through covid and had the worst happen but now the pandemic's over - I don't really feel any different.


Like, it was a short stint of shut in and bad behaviours, racism towards chinese and false pseudoscience (see: red onion cures covid).

It's beena long awhile since, how valid is it when people blame their personalities on covid still now?


I understand if financial circumstances changed, health changed, views towards racism changed but ...the base personality of someone having so many drastic flaws all because of covid, seems rather, I don't even know how that works? I have read articles on it trying to understand it but it's all ""may"" ""maybe"" ""may have contributed"".

But to change someone's personality on a base level, how true is it? Or were these things always there?

Also, side note, this started when HR asked me to take a look at their hiring protocols and I saw the transcript of one interview where the interviewee said something like ""If you ever think I'm not good enough for the job, it's because covid19 affected me. I'm better than the rest but you can't blame me for the pandemic.""

I was a bit, how to put it, bewildred? Like, does covid really do that!? I have my doubts but I'm trying to suss out if people are skeptic about this too or just accept that as a valid reason."

Like, most of my friends are white.

Now if you wanna go out and do stuff, you‚Äôre spending so much money. Like a movie, I would love to go out to the movies more often just to get out but 20 dollars for a movie that could be mid?

GenZ,Family keeps asking when will I (21M) get a girlfriend and it bothers me. Is that wrong of me?,48,2025-04-22 02:23:38,46,"

Went to visit my family over the weekend. When I visit my older relatives  they keep asking if I have a girlfriend. I always respond with no I don't. They usually leave it at that but sometimes they ask why. I don't know how to respond but I just usually say I'm not sure. Every year like clockwork I get asked this.

My one cousin (21M) specifically rubs it in. A little background information is that he does have some learning disabilities. He can function like anyone else it's just he talks a little differently and he doesn't always make the best decisions both financially and other things. I visited him as it was his birthday as well, and his girlfriend was over visiting him too.  When it was just us he kept bosting to me how he's in a relationship and keeps pestering me when am I ever gonna get a girlfriend.

I want to clap back because everyone knows while this girl is his girlfriend he's more like his caretaker and I wanna clap back with that, but that's not good.

Am I wrong to be bothered by my family keeps asking me when I'll get a girlfriend. I'm honestly trying but just no luck and it's a constant reminder of that I'm failing "

GenZ,Need a suggestion about Deliriant use. Please answer if you're aware.,1,2025-04-22 21:04:56,6,"God knows why I'm asking it here, but anyways.

So from many past many times, I'm curious about specific Deliriant. It's datura stramoniun also goes by the name of Datura. 

It's easy to find here as local plant and can be also find in shop related to religion practices as well as nursery(seed in small amount). 

I have heard many potential danger associated with that and what extent it can goes. But most specifically I'm curious about it's haluginating factor. I've heard that it gives a kind of hallucinations which is hard to disguise from reality. 

I'm deeply curious this halugunation effect. That's because what I experience regularly. I generally imagine a kind of scenario which never happened, and Problematically I use to get confused if that happened in real Or not. It does effect my daily life sometimes. I also experience lucide dreams sometimes. 
I perfectly know that I'm not mentally healthy and I will work seriously for that, even I'm working for that like collecting money or trying my best to do what ever I can personally which can help me improve my Detoriating mental health for now like sleeping in daytime in a shifts of period of times instead of night because I generally use to get more dreams in night instead of day because I generally confuse them with real memory after a period of time Or keep a writing of every doubt-full memories which I know can be potentially my imagination which I generally cross-examine with person associated with that memory. 

 I will have to keep these things deeply to myself only as I can't involve my parents for that matter because it will make it worse only. 

Anyway, I need the answer of my question now because I will be alone at home this weekend and monday after, total three days. It's perfect time to try that. 

I want to knowthe full potential of hallucinations just for the sake of curiosity once before I go for treatment as it's getting worse and worse every day without any substance lol. I wonder what will happen with substance. 

Edit: it will be my first time taking any substance, not even a tobacco or alcohol yet.

GenZ,Why do Gen Z leftists resist coalition building and optimism?,118,2025-04-21 17:40:31,346,"Even in the face of America‚Äôs greatest threat? Why? It seems like the young progressive left just wants to stage a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party like Trump did to Republicans but aren‚Äôt organized, strong, and business friendly enough to do it. Is it because they don‚Äôt feel Trump is effecting them? 

Why do they also reject the abundance agenda, the only optimistic potential platform that‚Äôs been pitched and caught on in decades? Why would it be bad to have such an excess of essential goods and services that everybody can afford them? That doesn‚Äôt exactly inhibit progress towards single payer healthcare, it just gives people something to look forward to in the near future and is politically viable in a legitimate system this decade. Why is optimism across the board to young leftists generally considered corny? Why do we have to be angry all the time? Why not be strong, fortuitous, and looking towards the future? That‚Äôs what people vote for. 

Americans don‚Äôt want to dismantle capitalism, because in case you haven‚Äôt realized, we implemented, refined, and regulated it more prominently than any other nation. Imagine working so hard to immigrate to America only to find its now fascist or socialist? Seems a little unfair, no?"

GenZ,"Thinking about the future as the population of the USA gets both older & smaller, w/ less young people, I suspect colleges to become paradoxically more competitive institution.",0,2025-04-22 14:32:03,4,"I think universities will paradoxically become more competitive, as smaller universities who can't fund themselves with the upcoming smaller class size will fall away leaving only the bigger more powerful more expensive schools with a monopoly. I imagine that the result of that will be less people go to college, and schools continue to raise tuition rather than cut costs in order to stay elite institutions that can attract students from across the world.

* I think this especially because right now, as these smaller schools close the reaction from the government hasn't been, well 'let's try to keep our local schools open through gov funding.' But rather, 'let it all burn and only the elite will stand in the end.'
* You may actually see the big Northeast vs the rest of the country divide widen, as states in the northeast whose culture, and industries are based around education will do everything to prop up their school.

my thinking came from these articles:

essentially apps to these elite schools are increasing, while smaller schools are collapsing, hence I think were already seeing a consolidation of american colleges. "

Also, look at the amount of studies and courses in university that only cater to women (ig it makes sense because college attendance for men dropped off a cliff, libs dont care tho!)

However, the shiny light in the tunnel is that Gen Z men realize this hypocrisy and are outright rejecting it. We realize the gaslighting when it comes to women geting to pick and choose ""patriarchal"" beliefs depending on what conveniences them. For example, they still want men to be ""gentlemen"" and ask them out first, drive them around, hold stuff for them, buy them lunch, etc. In genz relationships, the man has to cater to the women 100% of the time and its bullshit.

GenZ,Is there something I‚Äôm missing from the Kilmar Garcia case?? (Explanation below),0,2025-04-22 17:26:20,96,"So Ive some my best to look into and actually read the documents and here‚Äôs what I got so far:

In 2019, Garcia was detained by ICE in Md, the ICE officers that detained him filled out a gang field interview sheet and said that he had apparel on that was synonymous with MS-13 and because an informant said he was, he was with three others and two of them were found to be ms-13 members

In deportation proceedings (the documents produced by DOJ) he requested bond and was denied and then he appealed it and he was denied bond again on suspicion of being involved with a gang, before his 2019 hearing, authorities told the court that their evidence of Abrego Garcia‚Äôs gang membership was limited to the ‚Äúgang field interview sheet‚Äù from the Home Depot arrest, and they had nothing further to add

When he eventually had his deportation hearing, The court granted withholding of removal as long as he checked in with authorities annually, something he attested to doing in court filings. This gave him legal status in the United States temporarily and allowed him to receive a work permit.

Since then hes had no criminal convictions, hes had no arrests and has checked in with DHS every year on time, the only thing was the temp protection with his wife, but it seems like it got solved

I keep hearing that he doesn‚Äôt get due process, he‚Äôs already had due process, hes a violent meme we of MS-13

My question is simply what am I missing from all this?? Because if he was a member of ms-13 why didnt they jjst appeal is withholding of removal and take him to court?"

GenZ,Adolescence show is misleading.,0,2025-04-22 19:04:48,25,"Okay, so the YouTuber really took issue with a few specific things that yanked them out of the show's reality.


First off, there's this scene with the teenage girls, right? And one of them just drops the word ""incel"" like it's everyday slang. The YouTuber practically facepalmed at this. They were like, ""No way do regular high school girls just throw that term around!"" It's a term with a whole history and baggage from specific corners of the internet, and it just didn't ring true coming from a typical teen in that context. It felt like the writers just wanted to name-drop something edgy without really understanding who uses that language and where.


Then, there's this other moment where the girls are dissecting Jaime's looks, and the YouTuber felt they were doing it through this weird ""red pill"" lens. They didn't quote exact lines, but the way the girls were talking about his attractiveness (or lack thereof) and linking it to his potential issues just felt off. The YouTuber's take was that teenage girls usually don't analyze guys using that kind of framework. It felt forced and inauthentic.


Moving on, the YouTuber called out the show for how it handled Andrew Tate. Apparently, there's a point where they kind of lump him in with the whole ""looksmaxing"" scene. The YouTuber was quick to correct this, pointing out that while there's some overlap in online spaces, Tate isn't exactly a guru in the ""how to improve your appearance"" world. It was a small detail, but for someone familiar with these online communities, it was a red flag that the show's understanding was a bit shaky.


The big one for the YouTuber was how the show seemed to pin everything on Jaime's dad. They showed this distant father figure, implying that his lack of connection with Jaime was the root of the problem. The YouTuber wasn't saying parents don't matter, but they felt the show completely glossed over all these other huge pressures young guys face today. Think about the constant barrage of perfect images online, the soul-crushing experience of online dating where you're judged on a few photos, and just this general feeling of being disconnected in a hyper-connected world. The YouTuber felt the show took the easy route by blaming the dad, instead of diving into these much more complex and relevant issues.


And this leads to the YouTuber's point about what the show didn't explore. They were surprised the show didn't touch on things like body dysmorphia and the insane pressure guys feel to look a certain way, thanks to social media and online trends. The YouTuber felt that would have been a much more direct and honest way to explore male insecurity and isolation, which seemed to be what the show was aiming for anyway. Instead, they went with the more traditional ""bad dad"" trope.


Finally, the YouTuber touched on why some guys actually do find a weird kind of comfort in these online spaces, even the ones that might seem messed up from the outside. For guys who feel like they're failing in the real world ‚Äì with dating, with social stuff ‚Äì these online groups can offer a sense of ""Hey, I'm not alone in this."" Even if the advice isn't great, just finding people who get what you're going through can be a relief. It's a place where they might feel a sense of belonging, even if it's a bit twisted. And for guys obsessed with improving their looks, it's about taking back some control when they feel powerless in other areas of their lives. The YouTuber felt the show completely missed this aspect, only painting these online worlds in a negative light without understanding their initial appeal or the flawed sense of support some individuals might find there.

GenZ,Perfectionism is ruining my life,8,2025-04-21 19:05:49,9,"This is going to be really hard  to write out in words, because I'm really bad at articulating myself in a way that makes sense but I'll try my best.

Perfectionism is deadass ruining my way of life. I feel like I need to be perfect in order for people to like or accept me, because I know if I fuck up around people they're never going to let that down and only focus on the bad, and its the reason why I try my 100% best not to make any mistakes as possible.

 However it's getting to the point where it's severely hurting my mental health. Trying literally anything fucking infuriates me, because if i cant get the hang of it within minutes, ill have a full on mental breakdown that I cant do anything right. Literally a few weeks ago I tried going to a Dnd club at my university to try and make friends, (even though i don't like Dnd).... Well it's safe to say that I won't try and pursue friends probably ever, because when people were trying to teach me how to play it I got really pissed, and it wasn't even at them, it was because I couldn't learn it as fast as I thought I would, and would take ages for me to fully understand it. Also trying to be social to them felt hard, because I was trying to be perfect, and try my very best to not sound dumb instead of just being myself. So after that breakdown I just left (bet they thoughtk i was some weirdo) 

It's even effecting my hobbies (video games, anime/manga, and gym) If I'm playing a game I HAVE to be playing perfectly or there's no point in playing the game (main reason why I don't play games with others) or If I'm watching anime or reading Manga I have to be in the perfect mood, or else it disrupts the way I read, and if im not in that mood, I'll re-watch or re-read the same chapter or episode over and over again until I feel that perfect feeling again (same thing with the music I listen to)

It's effecting almost every aspect of my life, even cooking is something that needs to be perfect. For example yesterday I tried making rice, with asparagus and beef cuts, and had to re make it THREE times because it didn't satisfy the way I wanted it to causing me to basically waste money. 
Making friends and getting a relationship is borderline impossible, because I'll need to constantly put a mask on to other people that I'm good enough to be around, and its really pissing me off. Like I want to let go, but it's superhero to when you're practically conditioned to think like this."

One trait that‚Äôs been held constant through generations of men as a sign of masculinity is stoicism. I‚Äôm not saying to bottle up your feelings or not speak up when you‚Äôve been slighted, but to temper it by reducing the frequency you bitch and moan about shit. 

There is nothing more masculine than maintaining a cool, level head in the midst of chaos. Constantly crying over height, or money, or body counts is just‚Ä¶ Pathetic, y‚Äôknow? It does not exude the confidence that a masculine man should have. 

Sometimes you just want to be heard, to point out double standards and injustices‚Ä¶ But you have to learn to not allow it to affect you mentally. 

Learn to roll with the punches. This will help you in damn near every area of your life.

The argument is ridiculous once you stop straw manning people with different political 
opinions. The Left isn‚Äôt trying to destroy white peoples lives, Christian lives, or men‚Äôs life, and the Right isn‚Äôt trying to destroy LGBTQ lives, minority lives, and immigrants lives. The Right isn‚Äôt pro life because they view women as baby making objects; they view the fetus as having inalienable rights. The Left isn‚Äôt pro choice because they love killing babies; they value the mother‚Äôs right to have control over her body over the life of the fetus.

People should largely choose their friends over similar hobbies and interests. People should value their friend character not what political side they fall on a divisive topic.

GenZ,"Lonely genZ guys, DO NOT listen to Redditors for dating advice.",6,2025-04-21 12:47:30,67,"Especially leftist redditors, they continuously give  unhelpfull, unproductive and counterintuitive advice.

As an ex-lonely genZ male who now has a girlfriend, I want to lay out very specifically what I did to get myself out of my situation, and why listening to reddit would have gotten me nowhere.

The main crux of why reddit sucks for dating advice for men is they will routinely say:

 ""Stop treating women like a monolith, stop trying to get a girlfriend, just live your life and be nice and love will come""

This is good dating advice for women, not men. 

Yes, I DID have to go out and actually ""get"" a girlfriend, I actively pursued it, and it worked.

Here's what I did to get a girlfriend:

I visited this social hobby club, dressed well, that I otherwise wouldn't have gone to in my university, once I got there, I scoped it out, and made sure to sit next to girls I was physically attracted to, and that i haven't spoken to before.

I introduced myself to both girls sitting next to me, and, started up the conversation and let it go where it went naturally. It went really well with one of the girls and she asked for my contact.

The next day, I texted her to get lunch, we hung out for hours, we did this one more time and at the end of the second time, I asked her out, I was very clear that it was a date, and she said yes.

Our dates went well and after 4 I asked if she wanted to stay committed and be official and she said yes.

So here's what I learned:

-look good as possible, get fit and dress well.

-YES, AS A MAN YOU DO HAVE TO ACTIVELY PURSUE A RELATIONSHIP, IF YOU WANT ONE, IT WILL NOT FALL IN YOUR LAP.

-The best place to find a gf is somewhere where you can sit down and get to have a conversation with women that you don't know, ideally while partaking in some activity but not one thats too distracting, to see who you vibe with.

-repeat these things and it's actually not that hard to get a gf if you simply don't listen to reddit. "

I don‚Äôt forget major events that happen or long term changes, but I keep thinking that I did something and then finding out a week later that I didn‚Äôt do it. For example, the other day my mom went to Trader Joe‚Äôs and saw that they were selling tote bags (you know, the new cute ones). I had mentioned this to my gf and she said ‚Äúthe tote bags are cute.‚Äù Today, my gfs relative gives her a tote bag and I say, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt I ask if you wanted one of those and you said no?‚Äù But I went back and checked my messages with her and this literally did not happen. It makes me upset with myself when I try to be as considerate/think of her as much as possible and I somehow invent scenarios like this. I‚Äôm sure this has to do with short form media - I‚Äôve been working on reading more but picking up my phone is still a bad habit, and using it when there‚Äôs lulls in conversation or when commuting to/from work. But this short term forgetfulness or thinking that I didn‚Äôt something that I actually didn‚Äôt is killing me. "

GenZ,I feel like I live in times where women have to chase men.,0,2025-04-22 02:21:18,120,"



I‚Äôm a conventionally attractive woman in her 20s. I feel like I have to chase men, that I have to struggle and put in effort to find a male candidate. Men seem uninterested in frienship with me in real life. In dating apps they seem they intrested in sex only.

I think dating apps have made men avoid forming relationships with women in real life. They take the easy way they open an app, pick a woman, and that‚Äôs it. 

I feel like people are scared of talking to strangers. They open apps and book people like they book tickets, hotels, etc. That‚Äôs why normal human connection in real life is fading because they‚Äôre scared of the unknown, of reactions. It‚Äôs easier for them to click on an app, browse social media, and back off by just deleting a profile if something goes wrong.  

So now, for women, it‚Äôs literally a must to be present on dating apps, on Instagram, etc., to present their profiles and pictures like objects for sale. People market themselves like objects nowadays.  

It‚Äôs a pity that normal human connection has died. In public places, among strangers, there is silence. People don‚Äôt even look each other in the eyes. They‚Äôre hunched over, staring at their phones.  

It‚Äôs painful to observe. Very few people reflect on it. They behave like NPCs millions of the same copies. Nobody thinks deeper about it because it has become a habit for them. And when I look at these people, I feel contempt. Like I don‚Äôt fit in with them, and I don‚Äôt want to be part of them and their habits.  

In previous generations, men would literally fight for females because it‚Äôs human nature. They would see a woman they liked and talk to her in a friendly way. Now, if men approach me, they straightaway reveal they want to go on a date with me or demand that I GIVE THEM my number, my contact, etc. Instead of OFFERING their number like gentlemen who used to offer their ""business card"" now men approach women as if they‚Äôre cheap prostitutes.  

Give me your number, go on a date with me, you look pretty,"" nice ass etc. Zero friendly, human, neutral conversation about surroundings just being an abrasive creep who immediately treats you like an object, not a human who shares the same ground, has dreams and goals. They treat women like they‚Äôre just walking ass and tits, and that‚Äôs all they notice.

GenZ,Women are Lonely also!,450,2025-04-20 02:18:18,324,"  There has been gender wars between the two groups on here. Almost like everyday. I see men make blanket statements. Saying women have it so easy in friendship and dating. This is downplaying our struggles.

I am a woman but I‚Äôm a mono-racial Blk woman. Who is ND. Dating apps have been awful. I know for sure I would get way more interaction if I was lighter or had loose hair. I think I am cute. Just not hot. I have a baby face also. So most men don‚Äôt approach me in public. I‚Äôm also skinny. I look like Skai Jackson when it comes to having a baby face.  I have high cheek bones. Most guys just want sex. I also get attached to easily and want phone calls. I may text too much also. It‚Äôs hard to read social ques over texts.

My one friend I have is moving to St. Louis this summer. To help take care of her best friend who is pregnant rn from college w twins. She will only be there for six months. But I honestly think she will be there longer. Bc she is working to get a license in counseling over there. She is graduating like me soon. She wants to go back since  she did undergrad there.

I am now back at square one üòÉ. Just in time for summer. When it comes to friends. I have never had a boyfriend. I am a virgin. (I don‚Äôt care about this anymore). It‚Äôs just rare at my age. I don‚Äôt want kids. So dating will be harder. My extended family isn‚Äôt close. It‚Äôs also hard to make friends in the U.S.A. Ppl are individualistic. I am even thinking about joining religion just for community. Im am not a strong believer though. It‚Äôs so hard to fake it and be genuine. I so badly wish  I could be religious. I don‚Äôt know if I overthink about it. I am also the oldest sibling. So I have no big sibling mentor. The point is does it look like I have a social life or community. You men aren‚Äôt the only one who struggle in this area.

TDLR: Women have social issues also, not just men. We all have it bad.

When I was 14 people thought I was 10 or 12 and now I'm 18 and people think I'm at least 14 or 15 years old. 

I'm not complaining but I get nervous whenever someone wants to know what I look like (well someone I want to be friends with) and I show myself and they compliment me but a few say that I look too young for them. Yesterday a guy I wanted to be friends with me completely ghosted my ass even I told him I am 18. 

I'm now slightly worried that any guy I want to befriend or a guy I fall for will see me and leave me because they don't think I am the age I told them I am.

Men aren't claiming to experience heightism out of maga craze, and most women IRL don't actually even pretend to care about or hide it, so i don't know why people online try so hard to do it for them.

Feminism isn't the worship of women. Women are just people, and everyone is constantly saying how shallow and superficial and uncaring and inconsiderate people are. Its more bigoted to say that ""people"" somehow doesn't include women when speaking like this. I personally have no idea why if that is true, that it would be so profoundly unfathomable to anyone that women could possibly be shallow or superficial. 

Its not bigoted to express your own personal experiences, and men aren't responsible for warping their own memories or perception of reality to make up for the fact that there are women in the world who are themselves bigoted with a misandrist spin instead of a misogynist one. ""I have noticed over the course of my life a preference for tall men, as well as rich white blue-eyed ones"" is an objective statement. The proper response is ""Why could that be?,"" not ""You must be a violent sexual predator and its your fault."" (Don't pretend that's not a common response.)

THERE AREN'T NOT CONSEQUENCES TO ALL OF THIS LYING. 

Yall spending the last like 15 years having fun making fun of guys having a tough go at life has not been free of side effects. As we just saw with the 2024 election in the US, not nearly enough women of any generation including ours are themselves progressive or feminist for themselves to protect their own rights. Because of this:

YOU CANNOT BE VIRTUE SIGNALING AND CLOUT CHASING AND MAKING FUN OF OTHER MEN AT THE EXPENSE OF POTENTIAL PROGRESSIVE MALE VOTERS.

This is my biggest concern when seeing all of the shameless gaslighting online that's been going on for well over a decade at this point. Youre alienating men from progressive ideals by pretending to be progressive (heightism is bigotry and defending it through denial of its existence makes you a bigot) and invalidating them. 

Discrimination of any kind I believe is inheritly political, and heightism is no different. Im sure I'm going to get a few losers typing nonsense like ""Omg you're schitzo what does this have to do with politics"" and guess what, tons of people have always said the same thing about racial and religious discrimination. While height isn't the most profound subject, it's something that affects pretty much an entire half of the population and almost entirely in a negative way.

Im 5'9"" - 5'10"", I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF SHORT. DO NOT COMMENT THAT I HAVE AN INSECURITY ISSUE RELATING TO MY HEIGHT FOR UPVOTES.

All of my exes have made remarks of varying degrees and frequency about me either just being shorter than they'd like or at least being smaller than some exes of theirs. I've also lost all of my exes directly to guys taller than me, paler than me, with blue eyes unlike me, and with richer parents than me, as well as all being more conservative than me to the point of some of them displaying confederate flags on their property and all being openly MAGA.

I AM NOT ALONE AND WILL NOT BE TOLD OTHERWISE OR THAT I WAS SOMEHOW THE BAD ONE. I VOTED FOR BIDEN (and would have voted Kamala, I planned to go twice but have just been very sick for a few years now and had an especially bad flare up that week and couldn't leave the house I'm sorry.)

We have to stop pretending this isn't happening and HAVE REAL HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHY THIS IS IF WE WANT ANYTHING TO CHANGE.

I could write a book about this and I'm sorry this post is so long, I'm just so sick of seeing people still be debating if this shit is even real after years and years instead of asking each other what we can be doing to stop it. We should be way farther along than this.

Happy Easter yall.

Edit: Yeah I should have known better, aint no way even 1 person bothered reading past the first like paragraph and everyone is just taking the opportunity to virtue signal and troll. At least when Trump wins 2028 too I can at least say I tried saying something somewhere."

GenZ,A response to the male loneliness posts,144,2025-04-19 18:47:49,441,"I'll give it to you straight.

Lonely men, almost no one likes depressed guys.

I get it, you think a relationship is the cure for your depression but that isn't fair to your would be partner. You would expect them carry the baggage of your emotional distress until you manage to fix it.

Why would a woman choose you when you come with a heavy burden? Maybe you think a woman should invest in you with unconditional love in order to earn your unconditional love? It's not an attractive offer for most women.

You may be lacking self esteem because of your looks or personality or even what little you own. But that's not the main reason for women rejecting you. Ugly men get into relationships, assholes and scum men get into relationships and even people that own nothing get into relationships.

Don't push your problems on women and expect them to fix them by lowering standards or accepting you as you are even if you're not enough for them. You need to fix your problems yourself.

You will see people tell you that you need to improve yourself, and they are right. Workout to improve your physique, improve your posture, style your hair and dress better, try to empathise with people to get a better understanding on how they feel, educate yourself, Etc. There are countless ways to improve yourself to become attractive enough for women to accept you.

Learn to love yourself, it will fill you with joy and cure your low self esteem.

Also you're allowed to have standards you don't need to accept any woman, my whole point for this post is that you need to straighten up in order to appeal to the women you would like."

GenZ,What going to happen to the dating scene in 10 to 20 years?,2,2025-04-20 17:22:10,157,"
For men it‚Äôs becoming common knowledge that being average isn‚Äôt enough anymore and the black pill is becoming more popular than ever, with the ideology being commonly spread across tiktok, youtube, and shows and movies are being made about it so of course a good portion of the youth is bound to be affected.

There is a lot of misandry going on in social media with a rhetoric that all men are evil and useless now

Dating apps are proven useless for everyone except the top 10% percent of men. Cold approaching is demonized and is practically at a point where it‚Äôs no different from tinder since the average woman knows they have plenty of options waiting for them on an app. And of course women in real life will actively purse the top 10% of men as-well.

As for women many have become ok with not having a romantic partner at all or just waiting for a chance with a top 10% man. Pretty much every woman now knows that they can be independent and rely on friends and family for their emotional needs instead of a man. Also there‚Äôs the fact women are now just as independent financially speaking so money is less of a draw for women attraction wise.

So what happens in future? Is there gonna be population decline ? Do more ideologies pop up? Do beauty standards continue to raise to impossible heights? Are men and women going to be more divided?

GenZ,How do I (21M) become more attractive personality wise?,1,2025-04-20 19:25:33,29,"
I want to be more attractive and I know I can't do much on the way I look. I know personality is a big part of attraction so I thought I could change that.

I'm described as pretty quiet I don't say much when around other people and in the past usually do things by myself or am usually by myself. 

When I do talk to people, I've been told I'm quite awkward. Some examples are I stutter quite a bit, Im soft spoken, I SOMETIMES have a tendency to break eye contact, and when I try to tell jokes my jokes have terrible timing or delivery. I think these mix of things don't really help so how would I go about changing those things?

I also don't have the most self esteem. I genuinely believe that I will fail or make a fool of myself every time I talk to a woman. I also find myself thinking that no girl would even want me as their first choice. I believe this as I have made a fool out of myself when talking to girls as I try to talk to women but they either flat out don't want to talk to me or they just put up with me and just walk away from me. For not being the first choice, I have dated someone a couple years ago and I found out she only dated me because her ex didn't want to be with her and chose me. Once her ex decided that he wanted her again, immediately broke up with me and got back with him."

GenZ,"Being short sucks, because it‚Äôs one of the few things you can‚Äôt work on",58,2025-04-19 19:56:10,128,"TLDR: Being short (5‚Äô4) sucks and I‚Äôve tried to compensate and improve myself in other ways, and it still screws me. Nobody cares. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. 

All you can do is compensate in extreme ways, either with wealth (like I have to do to even have a chance) or a literal perfect personality.

I see all these comments telling us short guys to simply ‚Äúhave confidence bro‚Äù or ‚Äújust work on yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúget over it, life is more than relationships‚Äù. It rings so hollow for me and, in fact, makes me angrier, because it reeks of dismissal and lack of empathy.

How can I be confident when I get literally zero matches on dating apps (despite paying for premium subscriptions and working extensively of my profile) for weeks on end and literal looks of disgust sometimes? How can I just work on myself more than I have (I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on therapy and courses to fix me, and the improvements have only been marginal)? Sure, I guess I could get over it, distract myself with other stuff, but that nagging feeling and frustration of never being able to find a real partner while my friends all happily partner up and get married will always be there, and the fact that it‚Äôs due to the one thing I can‚Äôt control (unless I cripple myself with an $100K surgery) makes it even worse.

I simply don‚Äôt know what else to do. I‚Äôve spent thousands of dollars on self improvement, have put myself out there, have improved how I dress, have improved my physique, have improved my personality with meds and therapy (despite my autism), I don‚Äôt know what else to do, and all I get when I bring this up is dismissal and in some cases even condemnation for even feeling this way. It sucks."

They also don't seem to realize that by taking that very job, they're also denying somebody else who may need that job more than them?

funny,Frightening My Daughter,49,2025-04-30 23:29:53,6,"I‚Äôve been binging the Stephen King audiobook Holly Gibney series for a couple weeks while wearing my Beats noise cancelling headphones. Sailing away into a creepy fantasy world that only Stephen King can create imo. 4 hour drive to Nebraska for my sons college football spring game, Stephen King. 2 hours that night in a sketchy Motel in Lincoln (Thanks to Expedia), Stephen King. 2 hours the following morning. 4hr hour drive home. In the Garage ‚ÄúMan Cave‚Äù (I‚Äôve named the ‚ÄúGarage Lodge‚Äù) that night. Pretty much any free moment I have, Stephen King. Because Im not a very jumpy type person, my wife finds it funny to sneak up behind me while wearing my noise cancelling headphones, absolutely engrossed and scare me. Now my 11yr old daughter thinks it‚Äôs funny too and has joined Her Mother in startling me while listening. So when I was cleaning up the ‚ÄúGarage Lodge‚Äù and heard the scraping sound of dragging 1 of 2 trash cans up the drive after trash day to put back along the side of the house, I decided to get some retribution. I grabbed a ‚ÄúScary Movie‚Äù type hood/mask from the garage, creeped to the exact corner of the house she should arrive at, and waited silently. When the perfect moment was upon us I leapt out and made a frightening sound only to see the little neighbor girl doing an act of kindness by dragging our trash cans back for us. She stood there absolutely frozen and eyes wide as I quickly removed the hood and my grimacing face and said, ‚ÄúOmg, honey!! I‚Äôm sorry. I thought you were my daughter and I was trying to scare HER!‚Äù
‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúUmm it worked.‚Äù 
Right then, my daughter came walking around the corner carrying her backpack with a big grin on her face. ‚ÄúLet me guess, my Dad thought you were me and tried to scare me and got you instead. Good try Dad!‚Äù And they started walking away while she telling her how they‚Äôve been scaring me and looked back at me shaking her head with a grin and said, ‚ÄúYou failed!‚Äù üòÇ"

amitheasshole,AITA for letting my daughter host a sleepover on the day of her Birth Mothers funeral?,2016,2025-05-01 19:06:57,450,"I'm a 39 year old man who has a 14 year old daughter, when my daughter was 1 I was awarded sole custody of her and also granted a  non-harassment order against her birth mother (basically a restraining order for those who don't know what that is). My former partner was a danger to my daughter though i'll spare you all the details as it goes against the rules here and it's hard to think back on. Her Maternal Grandmother is allowed one 3 hour supervised visit each week but that's it and is her only tie to that side of the family. 

When we heard that she had passed away my Husband and I sat her down to break the news to her, she didn't react particularly strongly either way, she is aware of why they weren't allowed to meet and had never shown any interest in her before. She asked us if she had to go to the funeral clearly not wanting to and I told her i'd prefer she not go as I don't want her exposed to that shitshow or the potential guilt tripping from them. My husband then told her if she wanted to do something on that day though she could, and I was in agreement with this. She asked if she could have her two best friends stay and go to the movies. After a brief discussion we agreed to this and they'll be going to see the Minecraft Movie on Friday and coming home to sleepover and have Chinese takeout. 

It was fine and we didn't think anymore on it until her weekly visit with her Grandmother. Her Grandmother told her she wanted her to come to the funeral to ""say goodbye"". My Husband and I shot that down immediately saying that we had plans on that day so no, she wouldn't be going. She got visibly upset at this and asked what we had planned that was more important than her daughters funeral (frankly i'd feel a root canal with no anaesthesia would be more important though I didn't say that). My daughter then revealed she was having a sleepover and going to the movies and her Grandmother was angry at this saying it was psychotic behaviour to have a sleepover the day of her Mothers funeral and how she had to go and ""forgive"" her for both their sakes. I shut her down at this point and made it clear my daughter didn't have to ""forgive"" anything, and that she'd be attending the funeral over *my* dead body and that she didn't have room to talk about psychotic daughters, that was too much I know but I lost my temper at how upset her words had made my daughter. 

This led to the visit being called short with the social worker who supervised stating both sides needed to cool off and take a break, advising we miss next weeks visit to give everyone a chance to calm down. My daughter was very upset and ended up crying when we got home, i've spoken to some of my friends about this and they agree holding a sleepover on the day of her mothers funeral is rather crass and we should have just done it the day after, AITA? My husband and I feel we're doing the best for her but maybe we're too close to the situation to judge it fairly."
amitheasshole,AITA for ruining my SIL's birthday by crying?,3517,2025-05-01 14:05:50,891,"I (43M) am an Advanced Paramedic in Critical Care. This means I‚Äôm trained to treat very serious injury and illness, and also work in my service‚Äôs Emergency Operations Centre to monitor emergency calls and dispatch other AP-CCs. Because it‚Äôs a high-stress job and my shifts can easily overrun, I usually only commit to social events on my days off.

Recently, my SIL (40F) booked a meal at a nice restaurant to celebrate her birthday. I initially told my partner (44M) I couldn‚Äôt go as I had a 6am-4pm shift that day. However, he really wanted me to go, so I got my shift changed from Ambulance Crew to EOC, thinking it would decrease the chance of being too late or too drained to go.

The shift was awful - my country‚Äôs healthcare system is extremely overburdened and I had to make a lot of difficult decisions prioritising calls. Near the end of my shift, I had to input on a complex, distressing call which took almost 2 hours. I left work 90 mins late and got to the restaurant about 20 mins late, in uniform and very tired.

When I arrived, SIL sarcastically said it was nice of me to finally show up and to make such an effort with my clothes. I apologised, saying I had a call that overran. My partner asked about the call, and I said I didn‚Äôt want to discuss it as it was upsetting and probably inappropriate for SIL‚Äôs daughter (8F) to hear. BIL (38M) said it was just a call and I wasn‚Äôt actually there, so if I‚Äôm going to use it as an excuse to disrespect his wife I should tell them what happened. I said it wasn‚Äôt an excuse, I couldn‚Äôt just hang up emergency calls when I felt like it, and SIL said I shouldn‚Äôt have taken the call when I knew I had to leave. I said I was the only AP on duty so what was I supposed to do, make a junior dispatcher do my job for me? SIL said not everything was about me or how important and special my job is, especially not her birthday.

I was honestly so overwhelmed I started crying, although I know it was probably an overreaction. I was also really embarrassed as I don‚Äôt cry in front of others, so I went to the toilet to calm down. My partner came to check on me and I said I just wanted to go home. He said it was fine, he would explain to SIL and BIL, so I left.

When he got home later, he said SIL and BIL were furious that I‚Äôd ruined the meal by making it about me, as they felt I should have made sure I was on time and out of uniform, or at least been more understanding about why SIL was upset. I said SIL made it about me by being rude over a 20 min delay when I was clearly exhausted, and he said I couldn‚Äôt expect others to manage my stress for me when I chose a high-stress job. I said I *was* managing my stress when I said I couldn‚Äôt go, and he said he also has a stressful job and still doesn‚Äôt use it as an excuse to flake on his family.

He wants me to apologise to SIL, and I‚Äôm still hurt over the situation. However, I feel really bad for ruining the meal, and I‚Äôm worried I did overreact and make everybody cater to my emotions. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not leaving my planters or landscaping my lawn when I move?,1084,2025-05-01 16:07:45,176,"So I'm moving soon.  I bought a house and I can't wait!!! Recently the people who bought my current house stopped over which I always thought was a no no unless you are selling to people who you actually know.  Which is not the case.  The reason for their visit was because they want me to leave my lawn decorations including my planters and they also want me to landscape the lawn for them.  They said they saw pictures of the lawn last year and that was one of the selling points.  And they want me to do do this at no extra cost to them.  

I told them no that the planters were very expensive and the cost to buy the plants and do the work was more than I wanted to take on when I have a new lawn that I need to take care of.  They said that they may need to back out of the sale if thats the case. 

Here's the thing.  I know a few things about Real Estate.  My mother and her husband work in Real Estate and so I have picked up on a few thing.  Both houses are under contract and if they were to try and pull out of the sale then I can exercise a no cancellation clause. I could either sue them or force the sale of the house on them.  I told them this as well. I also told them it's a small lawn and between the two of them it wouldn't take long to do and they can add their own touches. 

They called me an asshole.  And one of my neighbors told me I should just do it to leave the house on a good note.  I told them I'm already leaving on a good note because I'm scrubbing all the rugs, washing the windows and painting and fixing holes aside from just the general deep cleaning.  

So AITA for not leaving my planters and landscaping when I move?"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking people to stick to the registry and being frank about it?,1346,2025-05-01 14:56:21,1338,"So I (30f) am pregnant with our first. There are a lot of things we need but one thing I am giving free rein over is the clothes. We‚Äôre not asking for clothes, but if they see an outfit they want to get for baby to feel free to buy it and attached a guide of the season and what size baby will be. So if they‚Äôd see a summer outfit to buy clothes to 12-18 months instead of 6-9, but emphasized we REALLY needed stuff from the registry.

Anyway, this is where my mother called me the AH. I‚Äôve discouraged (her friends in particular) from straying from the registry. During my wedding they got us items that we ended up regifting or donating. Mostly it was because the items they got us we already had or had gotten. Example: we asked for new towels in dark blue and we asked for enough so we could donate our old ones to the animal shelter. We got the ones we asked for, but then her friend got us two sets of expensive wine colored towels. 

We donated them to a homeless shelter because 1) they didn‚Äôt match with our color scheme and 2) it made me feel good knowing someone else who would value them more got them for free. I still sent her friend a thank you note, because she still spent money on a gift. 

Anyway, recently my mom informed me that a friend was printing something for our nursery and I told her to basically shut it down because we already have the baby‚Äôs decor picked out (and mostly bought) and think of this being something that is about a 2x2 sign that would be over the crib. It didn‚Äôt even go with our theme at all. 

My mom‚Äôs argument is that you can‚Äôt tell people to stick to the registry. I agree but I can be frank and tell them that we don‚Äôt have a use for it. 

So AITA if I tell her friends directly ‚Äúhey, now that our nursery is fully decorated, we are asking guests if they would like to get us anything to please stick to the registry and clothing guide.‚Äù


Edit: our theme is woodland fairy theme and the sign is a picture of that coco melon baby with the baby‚Äôs name. 

Edit 2: we‚Äôve already mentioned on our shower invites to not feel inclined to get a gift but if they would like to, to please refer to our registry at _____. Most of our big ticket items are already bought. 

Edit 3: the sign‚Äôs design was sent today and I had my mom‚Äôs phone and saw it. She has not made it. The purpose of telling her friend is to primarily avoid the conflict of when pictures of the nursery are shown and the sign isn‚Äôt up there. I‚Äôll be post partum by then and don‚Äôt want to deal with being nagged about it putting it up. The sign has not been printed. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs using her cricket or getting it professionally printed but either way since it‚Äôs a custom sign, that is why I said she‚Äôs making it or it‚Äôs homemade.

amitheasshole,AITA: asked for 1grad pic for my daughter with my ex husband.,783,2025-05-01 17:19:44,225,"AITA?
Here's the story, all!
I divorced my husband 8 years ago, he has since remarried and I have never been happier for 2 similar people to be together. I cannot stress this enough.

Our daughter graduates high school in 2 months and I asked the ex if he will stand in one picture with me, our daughter and just him so she has a memory from this milestone with just her parents.


This simple request has spiraled.
He's ok with it, but is worried his wife will feel left out. Turns out, the resistance is coming from her. (For my daughter's grade 9 grad, he first said yes to a picture and then suddenly on day of, said no, because of his ex wife argued she too is part of this family). 

Its just one picture. She will be in plenty of pictures as the step-mom, but seems to have struggles making concessions for this and now all of a sudden, this is all about her again and not the grad. 

(For context I should also add she has admitted she reads over every text I send him (all kid related. We don't talk outside of kids whatsoever),  and he can't email me without cc-ing her. For the last 6 months I have ensured I have no contact with her, just him, as her intensity and wedging made me uncomfortable. 

But, now my daughter is mega stressed with all this and fails to see that this spiral of a simple, normal ask 1) should have never been an issue in the first place, and 2) isn't rooted from my end. 

The worst part is, my daugther WANTS a picture with just her parents and has asked for this explicitly yet her dad is on the fence based on what Wifey #2 will say. In my opinion, she has no voice here. But then, that makes me the 'asshole'."
amitheasshole,AITA for not taking over childcare duties until the parent actually left?,3300,2025-05-01 08:10:18,224,"

I (44 F) agreed to watch my nephew(29) son (2) for an hour while he took a shower and relaxed. We live in side-by-side duplexes, so it‚Äôs easy to pop over and help out. 

About 30 minutes in, he is still at my place, hanging out and talking. The baby poops, and I say, ‚ÄúPerfect, you‚Äôre still here‚Äîyou can change him.‚Äù He smirks and says, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm not gone be able to do that,‚Äù and starts going on about how he‚Äôs got other family members ‚Äútrained.‚Äù He said when he goes to his siblings‚Äô homes, they change the baby even if he‚Äôs still there.

I told him, ‚ÄúLook, I change at least two poopy diapers a day‚ÄîI‚Äôm just not gone do it while you‚Äôre standing right here.‚Äù (I‚Äôm a school nurse and have a couple of students with special needs that I assist with daily.)

He changes the diaper, but then spends the next 20 minutes venting‚Äîsaying how he‚Äôs trying to get a break from the baby and how it doesn‚Äôt make sense for him to come drop the baby off and still have to do anything. He said next time he‚Äôll just leave right away instead of staying to catch up, or maybe he should‚Äôve just taken the baby back with him.

At one point he even asked why my mother (who lives in the duplex on the other side of me) couldn‚Äôt change the baby, and how she needed to spend more time with him. I was like, ‚ÄúSo you think she wants that time to be spent changing a poopy diaper?‚Äù

He started raising his voice, and I had to say multiple times, ‚ÄúJust go take your shower. You‚Äôre wasting time arguing.‚Äù Eventually, he cooled off, took his shower, and came back to pick up the baby.

I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole because I agreed to watch his child, but refused to take over since the he hadn't actually left.

For background: I‚Äôm divorced mom. I have a 5-year-old and a 27 year old.. I‚Äôve been parenting for a long time, and I‚Äôve always handled things myself. I was happy to help once he actually stepped out. For context, the child‚Äôs mom was also at home but in an online class.

amitheasshole,"AITA for insisting on being paid the remaining amount for a wedding we managed, even though the client (a family friend) says he‚Äôs short on cash?",397,2025-05-01 19:10:39,74,"So I (36F) run an event management company, and last November, we managed the wedding of a client who also happens to be a good friend of my husband (let‚Äôs call him R). When R approached us, he was very clear that he had a limited budget. Because of the personal connection‚Äîand my husband‚Äôs involvement‚ÄîI agreed to take on the event at a very minimal cost, basically just enough to cover expenses.

We delivered everything R asked for, and even threw in a couple of extras from our side to elevate the experience. My entire team was involved, and we barely broke even. It wasn‚Äôt a profitable job‚Äîit was a favor, plain and simple.

Now here‚Äôs the issue: it‚Äôs been over five months, and R still hasn‚Äôt paid the full amount. There‚Äôs a pending balance of ‚Çπ70,000 (~$850). Every time we follow up, he says he‚Äôs short on cash.

And I say we because my husband has also been following up with him regularly, trying to keep things friendly. We‚Äôve both been extremely patient and understanding because of the personal history.

But it‚Äôs starting to feel like we‚Äôre being taken advantage of. While there‚Äôs no flashy social media display or bragging going on, we do know that he‚Äôs still spending freely in other areas. It‚Äôs just clear that paying us isn‚Äôt a priority, even after everything we did to accommodate his situation.

I‚Äôm now at the point where I want to pursue the payment more assertively, even if it means things get uncomfortable.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for wanting to draw a hard line and formally chase down this long-overdue payment‚Äîeven though we originally took this job as a personal favor?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not making my childhood best friend my best man because he slept with my ex right after we broke up?,2044,2025-05-01 09:55:57,399,"hey so this may be a lot but please bare through and read for me, so i‚Äôm about to be married soon and this has been eating me alive because i‚Äôve got people telling me alot of things as far as let it go but it‚Äôs not easy at all especially for someone i ‚Äúthought‚Äù i trusted. This has been a long time coming, but now that the wedding is approaching, it‚Äôs blown up in my face. so please read 

I (30M) am getting married in a few months. I‚Äôve been best friends with ‚Äújosh‚Äù (30M) since we were 12. We‚Äôve been through everything together. high school drama, college parties, family stuff. He‚Äôs like a brother to me.

About three years ago, I was dating ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù (now 29F) for almost two years. It was serious, and we talked about moving in together. Then things fizzled. differences in goals, lots of arguments. The breakup was mutual but hard.

Not even a month after we split, I found out Josh had hooked up with her. He didn‚Äôt tell me. I heard it from another friend. When I confronted him, he admitted it but said, ‚ÄúWe were never close. You guys had already broken up.‚Äù I was stunned. I told him it was a massive betrayal, even if we were technically broken up. He apologized but doubled down on the whole ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything wrong‚Äù line. We didn‚Äôt talk for months.

Eventually, we started talking again, mostly because of mutual friends and time healing things, I guess. But it‚Äôs never been the same. I kept it surface-level things like‚Ä¶.fantasy football, group hangs, polite stuff. He clearly thought things were back to normal.

Fast forward to now, I asked my other friend (the friend that told me about Josh and Emily hookup) to be my best man. Josh seemed genuinely shocked and later texted me something like, ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd be standing beside you on your big day, bro.‚Äù I responded and said, ‚ÄúYou made a choice that permanently changed our friendship. I‚Äôve moved on, but I haven‚Äôt forgotten it.‚Äù

Now he‚Äôs telling people I‚Äôm being petty and holding a grudge over something from years ago. A few mutual friends are saying I should let it go, especially since I did forgive him and let him back into my life.

But I never said we were fully good. I just chose to be civil. He thinks he deserves a place of honor in my wedding, but I honestly don‚Äôt trust him like I used to.

So, AITA for not making my childhood best friend my best man because of something he did years ago, even though we technically reconciled?"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to compromise on food rules I have for myself when cooking for two people?,723,2025-05-01 14:56:05,301,"I have eaten mostly vegetarian for years with the exception of a few days a month (when i‚Äôm menstruating) and on those days, I eat meat. It‚Äôs kind of a stupid thing and probably has no real benefit, but it‚Äôs how i‚Äôve fed myself since i started needing to and it‚Äôs become an important part of my routine. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loves meat and has it with almost every meal. 

I love cooking and make most of the meals we have together. Recently, he has been hinting that if he‚Äôs eating with me more often, I should eat meat with him. I made steak a few weeks ago and then his birthday happened when he asked for the same thing, he got quiet and distant after I made myself something vegetarian and said it would have been nicer if I had eaten the same thing as him. 

This all came to a boiling point last night when he brought chicken for me to cook for him. I told him I was happy for him to eat it himself but if I wasn‚Äôt eating it, I wasn‚Äôt cooking it as I had already made a perfectly good meal. 

He doesn‚Äôt treat me as a housewife or expect me to cook for him daily but he doesn‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt do this for him, since i was already cooking. I explained that I wasn‚Äôt doing it specifically because i was already cooking and that I was offended that he didn‚Äôt believe that the meal I made was good enough on its own. He got frustrated and later when talking to his friends, he mentioned it as a joke and they sided with him. I doubled down when i overheard this and he said that I should compromise if i‚Äôm making meals for both of us, and consider his tastes when deciding what to have. 

Am I the asshole? "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friend everything everyone has been afraid to tell her?,2701,2025-05-01 07:51:20,206,"I (17f) have a friend who got a new boyfriend a few months ago. Our friend group (5 girls) was really happy for her at first because he‚Äôs nice.

But it‚Äôs gotten to the point where they can‚Äôt be apart for more than five minutes.

He lives in a different city yet somehow he‚Äôs always here. When we‚Äôre at school, they FaceTime constantly. The moment school ends, he‚Äôs already waiting at her house. Whenever our friend group hangs out, he‚Äôs there too. It‚Äôs gotten really annoying.

We literally can‚Äôt be around her without him being there or at least being mentioned. And when he is there, she won‚Äôt even look at us. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre invisible. it feels like she‚Äôs not our friend anymore.

Last night, our group planned one of our usual late-night hangouts. We like to meet at around 10 p.m. and walk around all night just talking. But three hours in, it was obvious that she and her boyfriend were just walking ahead of us, talking only to each other and ignoring the rest of the group. Everyone else kept whispering about how annoyed they were and how mad this situation was making them. I wasn‚Äôt enjoying myself at all.

I asked the girls if they wanted to just leave them, because honestly, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd even notice. One girl said yes, but the other two didn‚Äôt want to abandon her. So I left with the one who agreed. We said goodbye, and only then did my friend finally notice us for the first time that night. She asked where we were going. I was so annoyed that I just told her that we‚Äôll talk about it later and left.

We went to eat ramen and continued our walk and honestly, that night was more fun than anything we‚Äôve done together with her in the past month.

The next day, she showed up at my house unannounced and of course, her boyfriend was with her. She demanded to know why we left. So I told her. Not just about last night, but everything everyone had been too scared to say.

I told her that she and her boyfriend are obsessed with each other. That ever since they got together, she doesn‚Äôt care about us. That she treats us like we‚Äôre only there for her convenience, like punching bags when she‚Äôs mad. That she acts entitled and thinks that just because she‚Äôs had a rough past, she deserves everything. That she‚Äôs rude. Possessive. That she thinks we owe her something just because she was the one who brought us all together.

I unloaded everything. She was crying by the time I was done, and she left.

But five minutes later, she started the argument again in the group chat, which annoyed me even more. So I said all the same things again, but this time I gave examples of every single thing I brought up. She left the group chat after that.

Now the other girls are mad at me, because some of the examples I gave involved things she had done to them, not just me.

I don‚Äôt know what to think. Am I the asshole? I don‚Äôt like how we all complained behind her back, but no one had the guts to say anything to her face but I feel bad that I made her cry."

I chip in for petrol every month. Her car started having issues back in August, so she decided to look for a new one. She found one at the start of September, but had to get a small loan to cover it. 

She‚Äôs paying ¬£100 a month on it and asked if I‚Äôd pitch in ¬£50. I agreed but made it clear that‚Äôd be my only contribution since I‚Äôm not on the title, and she was fine with that. I also said that I‚Äôd like to use the car myself when she‚Äôs not using it, and she agreed.

Last week, I had a day off work, and she was working from home, so the car was just sitting there. I asked if I could borrow it to go see family since she didn‚Äôt need it that day. She said no and that she‚Äôd rather I didn‚Äôt drive it without her for a while. 

When I asked why, she just repeated that she didn‚Äôt want anyone else driving it right now. I reminded her of our agreement and pointed out that I‚Äôm also paying toward the car loan.

She still said no, so I told her that if she‚Äôs not going to let me drive the car, then I‚Äôll stop paying toward it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to contribute if she‚Äôs going to refuse to let me use it on my own. She told me I was being unreasonable, but I don‚Äôt think I am.

AITA for refusing to keep paying towards the car when she won‚Äôt let me drive it?"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling a friend exactly why my wife and I wouldn't go on a trip with her.,7641,2025-05-01 01:04:37,643,"My wife and I (both 32, both F) have a friend named Anna (33). Anna is so sweet, very funny and can also be very naive. While this isn't *always* a bad thing, she is at times ignorant of how the world works/news etc. 

Anna has family that owns a large vacation property in another country. She's long wanted to take a friends trip there, and is finally planning on doing so. Multiple people have been invited, and this past weekend when she and I got coffee, my wife and I were invited. 

The problem is, homosexuality is criminalized in this country. In case you missed it, I am a woman married to a woman and I would not feel safe traveling there. I would especially be worried about my wife- she has a very classic ""butch"" look whereas I am more feminine. I know a lot of times these laws will pertain more towards gay men, but still. We would not feel safe, and that's what matters. 

(FWIW, my wife knew we were probably going to be invited and said ""fuck no"" to any idea of traveling there when I mentioned it. I didn't make a choice for the both of us by myself.)

I told Anna, no, I'm sorry but my wife and I would not be able to travel there. Well, she pressed why, I said ""because we're gay. That country criminalizes gay people."" She just said ""oh"" and kind of awkwardly changed the topic. 

Later though, I got a text. She said she felt I  embarrassed her for not knowing and while she didn't know, it's not like she's homophobic or anything, just that she wants to go on a trip there and why did I have to be so blunt about it? 

I'm really frustrated, and also- I feel bad. I'm not sure why. I guess I could have made an excuse, that airfare is pricey right now or we had something else planned but? My wife is saying I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know. AITA? 

EDIT- forgot to add, but I didn't include which country because I felt it was wrong. The government etc makes these choices- I would feel bad putting the blame on a whole country that certainly has an LGBTQ population, hidden or not. It's in the Middle East and that's all I'll say. "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to change someone's baby's diaper?,21437,2025-04-30 19:15:11,1906,"My wife and I have been married 10+ years and have a few kids.  

  
SIL and her husband had a baby 2 years ago.  No major complaints - they just tend to ask for people to do stuff that I would think they'd do themselves.  

* They'll come over our house (they live an hour away) and they'll ask ahead of time if we have their kid's favorite crackers on hand.  Why they don't just pack the crackers, I don't know (they are well off, money not an issue). 
* If one of them leaves the room, they'll ask one of us (my wife or kids) to be ""in charge"" of the baby - even if the other parent is right there, just scrolling on their phone or something.

 But whenever I say something to my wife, she says I'm being too much.

The other day, we're having a dinner at MIL's house when the baby had a poopy diaper.  SIL looks at me and say in the sweetest voice ""Uncle (my name), can you change the diaper?"" (she frequently does this when we're there but this was the first time I was asked)

I answered, politely, ""No, I'm sorry, I don't do that.""

""You....don't do diapers??""

""No, I don't do other people's kid's diapers if their mom or dad is around.  I mean if I'm babysitting, sure thing, but yea - if the parents are around - I just feel like its their job.""

SIL looks like she's ready to cry ""Well...I feel selfish.""

I smiled to try and set her at ease, ""Not trying to make you feel any way, just telling you a boundary is all.""

The table got really awkward as she got up and did the diaper.  Afterwards my wife blamed me for making SIL feel bad and said I could've just changed the diaper.  

Not trying to make anyone feel bad - but I've had 3 kids and I always took responsibility  -I watched them, I packed for them, and I changed them.  I'm not looking to be a secondary parent for this kid.

amitheasshole,AITA for kicking my foster daughter out?,73,2025-05-01 21:29:45,48,"My husband and I(47) have fostered many kids. We‚Äôve adopted 2, that we were fostering as we were able, and we have one biological daughter. A few years ago we had sisters come to live with us one was 15, the other was 7.  We had hopes to adopt them both but we were just currently able to adopt the youngest last year and her sister had already aged out. Her sister is now 21. Her sister and I never got along and it wasn‚Äôt her fault, she had issues with the law, trauma from men, and was also diagnosed with bipolar. At 18, she completely took off when I told her she would still have a curfew and rules because I couldn‚Äôt have her coming in late and waking up the other children. 

Last year she reached out again and about 7 months ago she was in a rough situation so I let her move back in. I noticed little things like her being weird towards my husband but I just told myself she has to see him as a father there‚Äôs no way, but then last week, she had gotten drunk and was making my husband and her drinks and he explained them as ‚Äúespecially strong.‚Äù Then I watched her on our camera try and crawl into his lap. He immediately pushed her away and told her this wasn‚Äôt okay to get away from him. She ran off to her room not aware that I had witnessed it as well. I went into her room and told her to pack her bags she had to leave. 

She got upset with me and said that wasn‚Äôt fair I‚Äôm suppose to be her mother and her sister lived with us, how she had nowhere to go, I said I am suppose to be your mother but that is suppose to be your father and you‚Äôve crossed the line. I told her we‚Äôd discuss how we‚Äôd go about with her visiting her sister but she needed to leave now. She just started shouting at me caled me a bitch and left. She‚Äôs also sent me a few demeaning text messages as well..

My mother thinks I was too hard on her because of her upbringing and actually let her stay with her a couple nights. AITA?

Add: He wasn‚Äôt originally drinking with her. My BIL and his wife came over and them 3 were drinking outside. She came outside and asked to join and my BIL said that‚Äôs fine. This occurred after they left."
amitheasshole,AITA for getting suspicious about my inheritance share after my uncle asked me to pay for his house repairs?,420,2025-05-01 11:56:13,89,"About two years ago, I (31F) found out I was named in my grandfather Lee's (87M) will. We weren‚Äôt close ‚Äî complicated family dynamics ‚Äî and he wasn‚Äôt wealthy. I figured I‚Äôd get ‚Ç¨200 ‚Äî lovely, but not life-changing.

Updates dried up, so I assumed it wasn‚Äôt worth chasing ‚Äî until earlier this year, when my parent (64), who‚Äôd declined their share, casually mentioned I might be due more than expected.

Fast forward to last week, when I got the weirdest email from my uncle Jack (61)

First, you need to know the key-players:

\- Jack is my parent's brother.

\- Annette (36F) is Jack and my parent‚Äôs half-sister.

\- Me, the grandchild ‚Äî my parent is Jack‚Äôs sister.

Here‚Äôs what I learned the next day:

Lee lived in Paris for decades but owned a house in Germany worth around ‚Ç¨600K. When he got very sick in 2018, Annette ‚Äî who lives in Paris ‚Äî cared for him and tried to help him sell the house to pay for care.

Instead, Jack flew in from Germany and persuaded Lee to sell him the house‚Ä¶ for ‚Ç¨300K. Half the market value. That sale makes up about 98% of the inheritance.

Jack ‚Äî who has earned tax-free income and ‚Ç¨5K/week in tips for 40 years ‚Äî ‚Äúrenovated‚Äù the house during COVID. Now he‚Äôs trying to sell it for over ‚Ç¨600K.

So what did his email say?

It wasn‚Äôt a friendly update. Jack asked Annette and me to ‚Äúredirect‚Äù ‚Ç¨3,000 from mine and Annette's shares of the inheritance to him ‚Äî to fund an issue with the roof of this house he bought at half price from his dying father. Specifically he suggested we each pay ‚Ç¨1,500.

This is:

\- An issue that‚Äôs apparently existed since 2002,

\- That would‚Äôve shown up in a building survey (he didn't do one because he ‚Äútrusted‚Äù Lee),

\- That he now claims he can‚Äôt afford to fix (while also reportedly trying to launch a business),

\- That he thinks I should chip in ‚Ç¨1,500 for.

Despite me receiving just 1/7 of the inheritance.

Bear in mind, he‚Äôd already screwed everyone out of an extra 100% of the inheritance by buying the house for half price back in 2018.

By this point, I didn‚Äôt exactly trust him or his maths. So I asked some basic questions:

\- Was the inheritance split he quoted actually correct, or just his interpretation?

\- Could I see the will?

Within 24 hours, I‚Äôd learned the split was correct. Before he passed, Lee had agreed to divide my parent‚Äôs share between his other two children ‚Äî Jack and Annette ‚Äî giving them each 3/7 and me 1/7.I wasn‚Äôt told this at the time. And to be clear: I don‚Äôt have a problem with it, if that was my grandfather‚Äôs wish.

What wasn‚Äôt fine was:

\- The weird, sudden cash ask,

\- The assumption I‚Äôd cover 50% of the cost,

\- The implication in a later e-mail that I‚Äôd been harassing the executor (who I hadn‚Äôt even contacted yet).

 I now feel like I‚Äôve been labelled ‚Äúthe difficult one‚Äù simply for asking questions about a situation no one explained.

So ‚Äî AITA for getting concerned and asking questions about my share of the inheritance after being asked to cover someone else‚Äôs home repairs?

Clarification: Jack selling the house thing to do with the inheritance. The inheritance comes from the money that Jack paid to buy the house in 2018. "
amitheasshole,"AITAH For telling my Dad that if he didn't ""Shape up"" my Mom was going to leave him?",120,2025-05-01 18:02:37,92,"Hello everyone! I posted this on AITAH but figured I might as well post it over here too. I have never posted on Reddit before so sorry if this goes against the guidelines or anything. For context, I am a 16 year old girl and my Dad is a 57 year old man.

I love my parents a lot, and I am so grateful for all the things they do to provide for me. However, me and my Dad have always had a bit of a strange relationship. He is not very good at communicating, and sometimes it feels like I can‚Äôt talk to him about anything.

This does bother me, but the real issue in our house is that my mom does EVERYTHING. Every day she makes dinner, does the dishes, laundry, etc. On top of this, she recently started remotely working full time again, AND she is currently going back to college to get her masters degree. I do everything I can to help her out, but I can only do so much. My Dad works full time, and that's it. He never does any chores or helps around the house at all. He does work a labor heavy job, and I understand it's tiring, but he could at least give our dog a bath or make dinner for himself or something. Both me and my mom have said many times that we want him to help around the house, and he always says he will, but he never does anything. He did the dishes a couple times, but he didn‚Äôt do it thoroughly enough and there was still food on them so my mom had to rewash them.

I‚Äôve honestly gotten really tired of this, as it‚Äôs been going on for years. Well, here is where I might be the asshole. This happened three days ago. My mom was in class that night, so she hadn‚Äôt gotten an opportunity to do the laundry yet, and there was a basket of dirty clothes in my parent's room. My dad offhandedly remarked ‚ÄúGee, there sure are a lot of dirty clothes laying around.‚Äù This made me really annoyed. I told him that he was a grown man and if he wanted clean clothes he could do a load of laundry himself. My dad looked surprised at this and told me to calm down. I have a tendency of speaking harshly to people when I‚Äôm irritated, and this was unfortunately one of those moments. So I told him that ‚ÄúI swear to God, If you don‚Äôt shape up and start doing some actual work around here Mom is gonna want a divorce.‚Äù I knew immediately I shouldn't have said it and he left the room looking really angry. Not sure if it's relevant, but he has been married 2 times before my Mom.

I told my mom about this and she says that while he should do more work, what I said was really mean and the divorce comment was completely unnecessary. When my dad got home from work the next day I tried to apologize, but he completely ignored me and just went outside. It‚Äôs been three days and he hasn‚Äôt said a word to me, even though I‚Äôve tried to say sorry multiple times. My house is now really tense since my Dad is also mad at my Mom because he thinks she wants to get a divorce . I feel horrible but honestly, deep down I still agree with the comment I said to him. So, AITAH?"
amitheasshole,AITA for winning my mom‚Äôs storage unit at auction instead of giving her the money to save it herself?,4536,2025-04-30 22:19:40,286,"I (24F) was in and out of the foster care system. My mom would lose custody of me and my three siblings, only to do the bare minimum to get us back, just for the cycle to repeat. I eventually aged out of foster care, went to college, and moved to another state. I still check in with my mom every week. She was diagnosed with heart failure. (which came on from other terrible decisions). I offer support when she reaches out, whether it's with money, food etc. Most of the time I don't hear back. And when I do, it's usually because she wants something. She has a long history of lying to and stealing from all of us. She's currently homeless. We have offered her a place to stay if she gets clean and she wont. After we turned 18, we reconnected with our extended family, grandparents, and cousins, and those relationships have become important to us. A couple of months ago, she called me in a panic at 2:00 in the morning. She said her storage units were about to be auctioned off, that she wasn't even behind on payments, and that the owners were trying to scam her.
She needed $1,000 immediately because there were only 15 hours left before the auction. I told her l'd check in the morning once I got to work and see what I could do. The next day, I did some digging and looked at the contents of the storage units. What was listed broke my heart: family photos, vases from great-grandparents, personal documents (birth certificates, Social Security cards, my mom's clothing and tools, and everything from my grandmother's house (she passed away just last year). I decided to bid on the unit myself and ended up spending nearly $1,200 for it. Afterward, I spoke to the owners, who told me they'd been trying to help my mom for months: discounts, payment extensions etc. But eventually, she just stopped answering them. They said they had no other option but to auction it. I was devastated. My siblings said that if I hadn't stepped in, all of those memories and important documents would've ended up in a stranger's hands. My siblings were relieved and grateful... but my mom? She accused me of violating her trust, told me l ""emotionally robbed her"" , that I stole from her, and said I was a mistake. She even claimed our grandparents would be ashamed of me. I ended up taking a few days off work, drove out of state to the unit, and went through everything. I only kept what belonged to me and my siblings-photos, documents, anything tied to our family history. I didn't throw away a single item of hers. Instead, I rented a new storage unit just down the road, moved all her belongings there, and paid three months in advance. I gave her all the info. Now I'm stuck with this heavy feeling. I can't shake the guilt, like l crossed a line or sank to her level somehow. But at the same time, I couldn't bear to see everything important to us vanish, especially knowing it would probably happen again in six months. AITA for buying the storage unit out from under her?"
amitheasshole,AITA if I don‚Äôt want to help take care of my spouses disabled friend for the next 30 years?,157,2025-05-01 16:04:48,92,"I (M27) and my spouse (F26) have been together for a few years (no kids none planned) and her best friend is disabled unable to walk or get around as much her current family who takes care of her is absolutely neglecting the entire house talking about hoarding and disgusting. I am set in a government career path for the next decade where I will be moving around 3-5 times and sometimes out of country, meanwhile my spouse is in school and hopefully will have a job in the medical field. We had minor discussions in the past about my spouse wanting her bsf to move in with us as her family house is filthy and she seen how nursing homes treat and abuse patients and don‚Äôt want her friend to be in one. Today we had a deep conversation about it where I told her that unless if we build an smaller house as an extension of our home then I‚Äôll be comfortable with it but under the same roof I‚Äôm just not comfortable sharing my private living space with someone not considered my family I‚Äôm not even comfortable with sharing my immediate living space with my own parents and siblings unless if it‚Äôs an extended home. Financially my career alone can take care of the both of us to get by but I‚Äôm not sure if it can take care of more. My spouse was not happy that that‚Äôs the only option I‚Äôm open to and argued that since we will be moving around frequently we cannot have an extended home at every house we get to. When I also brought up that what if we get forced into a place where only government employees and spouses are restricted to live in a government area, my spouse said she can buy a place to rent for her and her bsf. When i mentioned what if her bsf gets bored doing nothing my spouse mentioned when she gets done with work she can go hang out with her friend. Mind you we rarely see eachother because of my job and her school. This makes me feel like she is prioritizing her relationship with her bsf over our relationship. In the end she was upset that I was not more open to the idea and was willing to leave her bsf to continue living in the house she is at. AITA?

TLDR: spouse bsf disabled, bsf family is neglecting the house and bsf. Spouse wants bsf to move in permanently with us. Nursing home and bsf family is a no. I‚Äôm not comfortable unless if it‚Äôs in a separate extended house. Spouse mad. AITA? 

Update: Her friend has some type of disease I‚Äôm not exactly sure what‚Äôs the name but it degrades the body and bones overtime. Something as simple as opening the hand or walking is impossible. My spouse tells me it breaks her heart seeing her friend wither away overtime and promised to look after her before we met as she got the medical training to do so. She says she doesn‚Äôt want to lose another friend. I told her I know where she‚Äôs coming from but there‚Äôs too much variables and not enough planning done with not knowing when she would like her bsf to move in. Things got extremely heated and she said some very hurtful stuff that most people would have called it quits which I attempted but I backed down cause I don‚Äôt want everything we have done to go to waste. This is the only thing we have ever argued to this intensity. "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friends how strict my mom is?,326,2025-05-01 12:02:11,164,"I (17m) was playing games on my computer with my friends, just having a good time. Then I overheard a conversation between my mom and dad, where she was shaming me for ""not working enough"", and that i needed to do more around the house.

For context, i do work that other kids get payed huge amounts for, for free, every single day, and i have been for a long time. I had never gotten any sort of pocket money until i turned 16, when i started to go broke, and only then would i get a few 10 dollar bills. I would not get these very often, but when we talk about it, she calls me greedy and ungrateful. 

Now, this last incident was different, because she had no reason to be mad, at all. She just decided to talk shit about me, for the fun of it. Since i soon turn 18, i figured enough is enough. So, i told her that if she keeps goong eith all of that complaining, i would stop helping her fully.

Then she snapped. She went and got scissors, and cut all my cables, after she had turned of the brakers for my room, and made my powersuply explode (not like kaboom, but yk). 

The next day i told my friends avout it, and apparently, one of them had told their parents about it, which then they told back to my mom. And now, she hasn't talked to me since then (2 days). 

So, am I the asshole?


EDIT: I see a lot of people who think my point is asking for money for the chores, but that aint the case. I just want them to not yell at me for ""not working"" when i work just as hard as all other kids in my area, and in some cases even more than that. And that is where the money part comes in."
amitheasshole,AITA for openly practicing my religion even though it upsets my family?,140,2025-05-01 16:06:56,70,"Family situation: Me (15F), my dad, my step-mother, 2 stepbrothers (12, 11), 1 half-brother (5). My mom died of cancer when I was little, so the step-family has been in my life for 8 years. I don‚Äôt see my step-mother as my mom and I don‚Äôt really like her much, but until all this happened I tried to go with the flow because she makes my dad happy. I have mixed feelings about my step and half brothers, but I get along with them.

My parents were Christian, but only kind of culturally. Like, I was baptized as a baby and went to church on Easter and Christmas and that was about it. My step-mother is Very Christian. Like, church every Sunday and Wednesday night activities and family bible time and so on. My dad goes along with it to make her happy and I don‚Äôt like it but I went along with it, too, to avoid fighting about it. It‚Äôs boring, but I usually just read instead of paying attention.

So I‚Äôve always really liked history and ancient cultures and last year I had to pick a topic for a research paper and presentation, so I picked Ancient Greek religion. It was super interesting and I kept reading about it and different Greek philosophers after the project, and I think Neoplatonism and Hermeticism are maybe the most interesting things I‚Äôve came across.  It makes complete sense. So I started kind of practicing it in my own life.  It‚Äôs nothing crazy, I meditate and have some little rituals I do daily. I try to practice ethics and I decided to be a vegetarian. It actually makes me feel really calm and I feel like I do better at life instead of being stressed all the time.

I didn‚Äôt really hide it from the family because I didn‚Äôt think that was the right thing to do and my step-mother HATES it. She does whatever she can to get in the way, like bursting into my room to make sure I‚Äôm not doing ‚Äúdemonic magic‚Äù or something and she puts some kind of meat product in almost everything she cooks now and gets mad when I won‚Äôt eat it. She has my step-brothers convinced I‚Äôm practicing witchcraft, so they‚Äôve been acting weird around me.

After she found me meditating last week, she had a fit and my dad asked me to just not do that stuff at home to avoid upsetting anyone.  I told him that if she can practice her religion here, I should be able to as well and nothing I‚Äôm doing is bad. Now my step-mother is even angrier and my dad is mad at me for not compromising.

AITA? I like what I‚Äôm doing, but if it‚Äôs upsetting everyone this badly maybe I‚Äôm TA for not hiding it.

amitheasshole,AITA for deleting my bf‚Äôs Face ID off my phone?,103,2025-05-01 17:19:54,117,"Hi me and my bf have been together for about 9 months now and we‚Äôve had several talks about privacy when it comes to my devices and such. However this had only become an issues several months ago when I upgraded from an android to an iPhone. We have always shared passwords and such to each others devices but what he did kind of shocked me. One day when we were together I asked him to check something on my phone for me. He picked up my phone and swiped up and immediately he was inside my phone. This came as a surprise to me because I never knew that he had put his Face ID on my phone. When I asked him about it he kinda laughed it off and said something like ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter we already know each others passwords.‚Äù what my issue is, is that all of my really important information such as my banking information and other important documents can be accessed with Face ID. Yes there are other ways to log in however he doesn‚Äôt know my information to log in. The Face ID is like a cheat sheet and he could get in and see things on my phone that I don‚Äôt want him to see. The other day we hung out and we were talking about our finances and how much money we each have in our bank accounts and I made a joke about how my balance is so low that I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. Instantly he grabbed my phone and went to look in my banking app. I didn‚Äôt like that so I tried to grab my phone back but he is he kept dodging and me had almost gotten into it before I managed to grab my phone back from him. I told him that I didn‚Äôt like that but he just laughed it off. After we each went home, I called him and was talking to him about it and he seemed upset. The thing is my fingerprint is in his phone. However I told him that since I don‚Äôt want his face on my phone then he should also delete my fingerprint off his phone so that it would be fair. He kind of went quiet on me and ever since we haven‚Äôt spoken of it. Also just as side note: I do realize that I might seem as if I don‚Äôt trust him or anything however my family and I have gone through similar situations with people who deceived us and stole money from us so i can admit that when it comes to my money and finances I am very strict and uptight and my walls are up. Despite all of that, I still love my bf very much and I hope for us to one day get married. I know that if that time comes then I won‚Äôt have a problem with sharing my finances and information with him bc he‚Äôll be my husband, but I think that for now since we‚Äôve not even been together for a year, it‚Äôs a safer precaution I should take bc I‚Äôm not sure of what might happen.

They‚Äôve been ‚Äústable‚Äù for the past 3 years or so and moved in together during that time. Megan has talked to me several times about wanting to get engaged and blah blah. Never really thought too much about it because I honestly don‚Äôt like the guy so didn‚Äôt have too many comments on it.

I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (now fianc√©) since 2019. We met in senior year of high school and started dating then. We‚Äôve talked many times about getting engaged but we didn‚Äôt really want to rush it considering our age and starting out our careers. 

3 weeks ago, Megan got engaged ‚Äî it was at beach she used to go to as a kid. It was a nice proposal. I noticed my boyfriend was being really antsy when he heard the news but still congratulated them. 

Last week, my boyfriend proposed to me and I had no idea it was happening. We were so happy! But I had a feeling Megan would make a comment or two about it being ‚Äúclose‚Äù to her proposal and make a big deal about how the attention wouldn‚Äôt be on her. I wasn‚Äôt wrong.

Megan invited my fianc√© and I over to her place last night to just catch up and talk about my engagement. She had already seen me 2 days after my engagement but didn‚Äôt get to see my fianc√©. While talking, she made a ‚Äújoke‚Äù about how my fianc√© copied and followed in HER fianc√©‚Äôs footsteps by proposing. She said ‚Äúwell I guess [her fianc√©] really influenced you to propose‚Äù. It was such an uncomfortable comment. She laughed and then made a passive aggressive comment saying ‚ÄúIt was so close to our proposal! He could‚Äôve lowkey waited‚Äù.

At this point I was already annoyed and said kind of stayed quiet the rest of the day. She texted me later on when we left about something unrelated and just tinged her messages. I really wanted to say ‚Äúwell your fiance had ages to propose and didn‚Äôt so how is that relevant here?‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say that to avoid confrontation, but I should‚Äôve. 

She ended up telling our mom that she thinks I‚Äôm upset at her but I am because she made by fiance and I both uncomfortable with her unnecessary competition. The funny thing is, my fiance had already bought the ring 2 weeks before their proposal (showed me the dates and everything) but i had an unexpected work trip to attend to. AITA for getting upset at my sister‚Äôs comments? 

Edit for more info: my sister knows my fiance bought the ring weeks prior but disregarded this entirely when she made the comments. My fianc√© asked for my hand a year ago so our parents knew but wasn‚Äôt aware my sister was getting engaged. Our rings are drastically different and the the proposal settings aren‚Äôt the same at all. "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my sister I‚Äôm not getting her the stuff she wants for Mother‚Äôs Day?,58,2025-05-01 17:45:56,159,"I (21F) told my sister (27F) a couple weeks ago that I will not be following her wish list for Mother‚Äôs Day this year because I‚Äôm tight on money as I just got a new car and want to get our mom something nice for Mother‚Äôs Day this year. She was upset and told me she didn‚Äôt want a gift card and that me and my brother could go half on a gift for her. My brother is also tight on money due to his financial obligations and he could barely afford to get our mom flowers on her birthday a couple weeks ago. 

She brought it up again and I told her the same thing, she would still get SOMETHING from me, but i‚Äôm not in the position to ‚Äúgo all out‚Äù for three people this year, because my brothers birthday also falls on Mother‚Äôs Day this year. For a bit of a back story my sister has very expensive taste, going half with my brother would mean at least 50 coming from me or possibly more to cover a little more of the cost for my brother. For her birthday I went half ($100) on a purse with my mom for her, and with a new car payment and insurance, i can‚Äôt afford something nice like that for two people. 

She was upset when I said no again and said again that she didn‚Äôt want a gift card or a card or flowers. I said that she was ungrateful, the day is to acknowledge her as a mother, and I told her that she isn‚Äôt even MY mom, she‚Äôs my sister, and I wanted to get our mom, the person that birthed me, a nice gift because with the year she had I really think she deserves it. She ended the conversation, and is very obviously upset with me and hasn‚Äôt said a word to me since. 

So, AITA for telling my sister I won‚Äôt get her exactly what she wants this year but that I will still get her something to acknowledge her being a mother? 

Edit: I should have added this originally, but my sister isn‚Äôt married and she is no longer with her baby‚Äôs father. My niece is 18months‚Ä¶ not old enough to get her something quite yet. I wanted to get her something SMALL because I feel bad and don‚Äôt want her to feel left out/forgotten

Last year I didn‚Äôt get her ANYTHING material. I made a card for her with her baby‚Äôs hand prints on them. That‚Äôs it. "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to let someone check my phone after a coworker accused me of taking pictures of her?,6623,2025-04-30 16:36:25,533,"Throwaway account

So this happened at work. I (18M) was on my stuff normally, scrolling through my phone and watching YouTube videos, when a coworker (17F) suddenly accused me of taking pictures of her. That caught me off guard. I told her I hadn‚Äôt taken any photos and that I was just watching videos on YT, but she didn‚Äôt believe me and started getting louder and kinda annoying, drawing attention from nearby coworkers.

She said that if I had ""nothing to hide,‚Äù I should just show her my photos. Luckily, the manager was nearby and came over because of the commotion. We both explained our sides. The manager said that if I wasn‚Äôt hiding anything, I could just show the last two pictures on my phone to clear it up quickly.

But the thing is that had a lot to hide that I didn‚Äôt want to show ‚Äî nothing illegal, creepy or weird, and definitely nothing involving her ‚Äî but still private stuff that I didn't want anyone else seeing. So I refused. I told the manager I was willing to prove my innocence in other ways, but I didn‚Äôt want to compromise my privacy.

As a good faith gesture, I showed my phone‚Äôs battery usage stats, which clearly showed I hadn‚Äôt used the camera app recently. I also suggested to check the security footage. After reviewing the footage, it showed my phone was pointed at the ground the entire time and the angle wouldn‚Äôt have even allowed me to take a picture of her. So I was cleared.

Even so, a few of my coworkers later told me I should‚Äôve just shown the photos because ""She had the right to know if she was harrased"". I told them that the evidence proved my inocence and there was absolutely no need to show anything. Specially not to her, someone who I've never trusted.

So, AITA?"

My company is downsizing and some will be offered early retirement, others will eliminated outright, still others will be unaffected. I won‚Äôt know which group I will be in for three weeks. 

When I shared the news with my husband of 31 years, 62M, he was irritated that I shared the news and said he would rather I kept this to myself until I had an official answer so he didn‚Äôt have to worry about it. 

I was very irritated and told him he was being selfish and unsupportive by expecting me to handle this on my own.  Now he‚Äôs sulking.  AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking a customer‚Äôs daughter to wear her shoe at the restaurant? - F&B part timer,28,2025-05-01 20:45:57,20,"I work part-time at Saizeriya SG. Today during lunch peak hour, it was just me and one full-timer handling the entire floor‚Äîseating guests, clearing tables‚Äîall while managing the 40-minute queue outside.

While checking the Drink Bar orders (since some customers try to share the $2.90 free-flow drinks), I noticed table 47 had only paid for one but took two. I added the extra drink. Later, when handling payment at table 46, they pointed out that the child at table 47 had taken off her shoes and placed them between the table. Shoes aren‚Äôt allowed off at Saizeriya, so I asked the mother to have her daughter put them back on.

Soon after, multiple guests reported the same child was walking around the aisle , blocking other customers who are holding hot drinks. I again addressed the mother, asking her to ensure her daughter stayed seated. She was furious.

At payment time, she shouted at me, accusing me of ‚Äúcommanding‚Äù her child, though I had only spoken to her. She jabbed a finger in my face, yelling, ‚ÄúWHERE IS YOUR NAMETAG?!‚Äù
I called my manager and explained everything. The woman continued screaming, claiming I was rude, that the floor was wet (it wasn‚Äôt when I brought her to the table), and her daughter had to take her shoes off to avoid the water. If she had just told me her daughter spilled water, I‚Äôd have mopped it up without question. But she didn‚Äôt, even when I talked to her about the shoe removal issue. 

She screamed at my manager too. When my manager told her about informing the staff of the wet floor next time, she rudely pointed at me and said, ‚ÄúHOW ABOUT YOU STOP COMMANDING PEOPLE AND BE USEFUL‚ÄîGO MOP IT UP!‚Äù Wild hand gestures included.

It‚Äôs a self-service restaurant. We don‚Äôt charge GST or service fees and I‚Äôve worked here for five years. I‚Äôve been yelled at, but this woman went beyond‚Äîcompletely unhinged and borderline psychotic. 

I was so stunned I couldn‚Äôt even move. I went into the kitchen and just stayed there. Even my manager was red with stress.
It‚Äôs been over 12 hours, and I‚Äôm still feeling useless, anxious, and frankly‚Äîtraumatized. I need some unbiased advice: AITA? how do I move on from this? How do I stop crying in bed remembering this?

However, he is saying I can‚Äôt go back and I need to be here to help him with his work and In case something happens. I don‚Äôt want to forfeit my entire trip for this and given that he is stable and okay I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary for me to do that‚Ä¶ AITAH??

I currently work for him at his company and he wants to take a step back to retire and i will definitely hinder that opportunity if I chose to stay, been in a bad place mentally lately and truly think this trip is beneficial for my well being and experiencing new things.

amitheasshole,AITA? Or is my husband being unreasonable?,20,2025-05-01 19:59:56,86,"I‚Äôm a stay at home mom and my husband travels for work about half the year. As life has become busy with children I hardly ever do anything outside of my family. Well, one of my oldest girlfriends is getting married and having a bachelorette party. It will begin at a brewery and end at a strip club (she‚Äôs a lesbian, for reference). I initially said I wouldn‚Äôt go to the club because I don‚Äôt want to be out all night and tired the next day caring for my kids, but since then I decided I want the option to go if I‚Äôm having a good time. I mentioned the possibility of it today and my husband lost his shit. He says men go looking for women at strip clubs. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant to me. I‚Äôm not available so it doesn‚Äôt matter. And won‚Äôt they all be there for the naked women? Not the fully clothed women?? Anyway, I realize I said I wouldn‚Äôt go and then changed my mind but he‚Äôs done this before in the past. He always ruins anything I want to do if it doesn‚Äôt revolve around him or my family. It gives me so much anxiety and I already know what‚Äôs coming if anyone invites me anywhere. I don‚Äôt know if there is a solution to be had. Just venting I guess. "
amitheasshole,AITA for calling out my dad about how unfair his family treats me?,314,2025-05-01 03:15:51,58,"Growing up, I (21 F) had a good relationship with my dad‚Äôs side of the family. After my parents got divorced (it wasn‚Äôt messy they‚Äôre still friendly) I noticed his side of the family started to exclude me from family events but still included my brother (23 M). It‚Äôs been like this since I was 13 years old, they make no effort to include me and make me feel like I don‚Äôt matter to them, so I never put any more effort into having a relationship with any of them. Even though I know they don‚Äôt care about me it still hurts me. 

A few weeks ago, someone from my dad‚Äôs side of the family threw a party (which I obviously wasn‚Äôt invited to) and my dad and brother started talking about how much fun they had at the party in front of me. I made a comment saying something like,‚Äùif they liked me as much as they liked my brother I would‚Äôve gone‚Äù   
and my dad blew up. I figured that was my perfect time to tell him how I felt so I basically said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you see how unfair they‚Äôve treated me since I was a kid? They‚Äôve always loved my brother and hated me and excluded me from everything and nobody ever stands up for me.‚Äù 
In response to that he told me that I‚Äôm the one who isn‚Äôt trying hard enough to have a relationship with them and said I have to put myself out there/reach out to them.

amitheasshole,AITA - Kids crossing their eyes,50,2025-05-01 13:08:06,60,"A while back my father-in-law (65/66 yo) yelled at my two kids (6/4) for crossing their eyes. He completely flipped his lid, saying that it was going to do damage to their eyes. This is patently false, and just a myth that was told to him when he was a kid, soI stayed out of it and let my wife talk to my kids after, as I usually do with stuff involving her parents. She told them never to do that in front of Papa, and so far they have listened. However, lately, they have been doing it at home. Just kids being silly. But now my wife is getting on their case about it. But I have always told her I am going to stand up for them against her when I think she is in the wrong. Although my kids don't get every priveledge of being a grown-up, I do believe everyone in our house should be treated like a person with a right to do what makes them happy if they aren't hurting themselves or others. I feel like this is a baseline part of humanity: if it isn't hurting anyone, and it isn't illegal, but it bothers you, just look away. 

  
So this morning we got into a fight about it in front of the kids and her argument is that she feels strongly about it and I should just let her have it. I told her I do feel strongly as well, because there are enough truly harmful things in the world we need them to worry about, and crossing their eyes and being silly isn't one of them. In a vacuum, I really don't care about it. It is such a miniscule thing that I don't need to fight with her about. I get that. But it is the principle of it for me. This is the second time in a week that she attempted to make rules for others in the family based on nothing factual and just her personal feelings about things she has done zero research into (the first was involving me). I feel like it is a dangerous precedent to set, especially in the world we live in, where people are constantly trying to tell others what they can or can't do based on their personal feelings in spite of all evidence against it. I do not want my kids to carry-on that way.

  
AITA? Should I just back off and let her get on their case about something that is just a silly thing they do that isnt hurting anyone, or should I have a conversation with her about the principle of it all?

  
Cheers!"
amitheasshole,AITA for not waiting for my neighbors to go inside?,9,2025-05-01 22:10:08,30,"(tagging NSFW just in case this might be a sensitive subject for some.) 

My neighbors dog got hit by a car running after me and my dog tonight. I've been walking on this road for 9 years but usually wait for them to be inside to go so that their dog won't chase after us (we live in a rural area where cars go by fast and their dog has been known to run into the road before). But tonight was one of those first nice days of the season and everyone was making the most of it, and figured they wouldn't be going inside anytime soon. They were cleaning around in the garage so I thought they had eyes on their dog..so I went for my walk.

It all happened so fast, I saw her dog crossing the front lawn and didn't even have time to react that he had already crossed both lanes and got hit, right in front of me. 

I feel so guilty. I feel like my dog and I lured my neighbors dog to its death...

They both looked somewhat okay and told the poor guy who hit the dog that accidents happen and same for me but gosh..nothing would've happened if I just waited for them to be inside to go for that walk. 

AITA for going for a walk while my neighbors dog was outside?

amitheasshole,AITA for wanting my in-laws to visit less?,22,2025-05-01 17:33:49,55,"For context I am 29F and my husband is 29M, we have been married two years and together for 7. My husband has a unique career path that has us traveling almost every weekend for him to compete. He is very very good at what he does and I am incredibly proud and supportive of him and love watching him do what he loves and happy he gets to live out this childhood dream of his.

So here is the hard part, his parents/my in-laws come into town every single race weekend. In total staying at my house 33 weeks out of the year. They live about 20 hours away and drive down and will stay at our house for weeks at a time (currently at the time of me writing this my father-in-law has been at my house for 5 weeks) but they never tell me their plans, when they are coming or going, or even ask if it‚Äôs okay to come down, they just assume that I will have a bed open for them which isn‚Äôt always the case because I have people coming all the time and staying and training with my husband. So then I‚Äôm left shuffling things around at the last minute to make sure my spare bedroom is ready for them. I have a full time job with a far drive and a couple side hustles that take up quite a bit of my time too so when I get home I‚Äôd love to just relax but instead I feel like I have to entertain and put on a ‚Äúface‚Äù for them.

I‚Äôve voiced my concerns to my husband and he agrees that it is a lot, so we tried to talk to my in-laws 6 months ago and told them that they didn‚Äôt have to come down for every race but you would‚Äôve thought we just told them their dog died, they didn‚Äôt respond and just went back to eating dinner and avoided the conversation. I pay for all the food, all the extra utilities, all the special drinks /snacks only they consume. I make 98% of the meals (mother in law isn‚Äôt a great cook.) My father in law works around my house to keep himself busy which is very helpful but hardly can ever do things 100% by himself so then my husband or I get roped into assisting which puts our daily plans/chores on hold and then we get buried because we are behind.

My mother in law is also very pushy and always thinks she is right about things at my house she knows nothing about and I have to correct her often. For example last night she invited 10 people over to my house for dinner and decided to have my grandmother-in-law stay the night as well. Again she doesn‚Äôt cook so I was left to make all the food and desert prior to entertain everybody. So I had a party at my house that I didn‚Äôt ever get asked if it was even a possibility to have happen.

I just keep trying to tell myself that my husbands career path doesn‚Äôt last forever (although we wish it could) and his parents won‚Äôt be able to do this forever and to just put up with it. But the other part of me wants my home back and to be able to have some peace and quiet with my husband.


So am I the asshole for wanting my in-laws to visit less often?? I really just want my house back and to spend alone time with my husband."
amitheasshole,AITA for not helping some of my family after they exclude us from their celebrations/reunions,1710,2025-04-30 17:42:47,105,"Hi, I come from a large family, 9 aunts and uncles, half of which are in the US starting from the 70s and 1/2 stayed in the Middle East. I was born in the US.

When they come for their green cards, vacations, illness/births, we‚Äôre always here with our homes open for them. We have hosted one aunt and her daughters for about a month each year for over 20 years, and one of her daughters lived with us til they established themselves in the US. We also go down to visit every few years and see them often.

Earlier this year, my uncle passed and prior to then, his wife was staying in our home, we took care of her, did all her paperwork, helped find a new job, and when he died my mom flew out and is still with her comforting her. It‚Äôs been 3 months. Two days ago I find out that over Easter weekend, his daughter, who was very comfortable calling me when I was helping her mom, got all the family that grew up in the Middle East (the kids of three aunts) together for a little reunion and spent the week together. They went out and explored. Mind you, I just graduated college and waiting to start a job in May, so they know I‚Äôm off and alone. 

I just feel used, like we‚Äôre only for the dirty work but in happy occasions we‚Äôre forgotten. This has been a pattern with them. Their babys‚Äô baptisms, parties -forgotten- even weddings are a last batch invitation. We‚Äôre always here for help in the US, but now that they made it, they built this close knit, closed off circle just for them excluding the US family.

Now their mom, my aunt, wants to stay with us in the US til she finds a new home. Probably a year. She doesn‚Äôt want to stay with her kids, she says ‚Äúthey‚Äôre busy and need to focus on their own lives‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel very comfortable hosting her with a clean heart. 

I told my mom nope, she should go to her daughters or son. And she agrees. We‚Äôre a closed house.

Am I the AH for not agreeing to host/help her?

amitheasshole,WIBTA for calling out my professor for a comment she made towards me?,9,2025-05-01 21:45:50,34,"i'm a 19(F) in college and i'm taking a computer science class. The professor who teaches this class is the type of person who constantly says out of pocket stuff, or will say super rude things and laugh it off or pretend it's funny etc. i've been dealing with this all semester but today was the boiling point for me. So my mom recently graduated college, and for me and my family that's a huge deal (me going to college is a big deal) anyways I have classes tuesdays and thursdays, her graduation was on tuesday so I missed one day of classes. When I get to class today (thursday) she asked me where I went I told her I went out of state for my moms graduation and she replied with ""well doesn't your mom want you to graduate?"" and I just gave her a look because wtf do you mean by that... then she proceeded to say ""maybe it's just a cultural thing"" and goes on a rant abt missing school. mind you i'm a poc and so is my mom and graduating/going to college as a black person I feel is a big deal and it was very important for me to be there for my mom and for her for me to be there. I held it together through class but after I started crying and it just really upset me because my mom is one of the most hardworking people I know and I literally only missed ONE day and I feel like my professor 1. didn't have any need to be in my business and 2. didn't need to make the ""cultural"" comment. I talked to my mom about it and she said to just let it go but i'm thinking about emailing my professor and explaining why that was very rude and disrespectful. We only have one more class and that's when we take our final exam so maybe it's not worth it and maybe I overreacted but she's done this all semester and has done it to previous semesters (I know
people who've taken her class before.) I just don't think it's ok to be disrespectful to students just because you're the professor. so WIBTA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not forgiving father after he stole my inheritance?,3166,2025-04-30 13:02:38,229,"It's 1999, my mom passes away from liver cancer. I'm 25 years old, single child, wet behind the ears and gullible. 80% of my mothers estate at the time (about $16000 but we're not in the USA) pays out to me. My dad says due to my moms deteriorating mental health they never had time to change her will, the money should have come to him, can I pay it over to him. I agree, because one is supposed to trust your parents.

Fast forward about 5 years and one brief failed marriage later, he finds himself a nice Russian bride. The dynamic changes and he badmouths my late mom at every BBQ etc., and his new wife is the best thing  ever.

I move cities, get married, start a family of my own. We chat on the phone once a week or every two weeks but don't see each other for years (8 years to be exact). Him and the Russian bride come and visit once, borrow my truck to go to a big national park. I gave it to them with a full tank of diesel, I got it back empty, with the light on. 

In 2023 he sold his house and moved to Russia with the bride, I'm not sure if he invested the house's money locally or if he moved it to Russia, I suspect the latter so that the bride has easy access to it when he falls over.

My (now late wife) falls ill and passes away last year. I send a message to everyone after she passed away with all the funeral details and what happened. My dad's response ""Oh now that's bad news"". He doesn't bother flying in for the funeral service or anything. He messages me a few weeks later, asking if she was cremated or buried? Like w.t.f.

I speak to his sister (a highly educated P.hD with many law degrees etc.). We speak about my moms passing and the similarities to what happened to me. I mentioned the inheritance. She freaks out, she (being legally qualified) helped my mom with the will in the hospital before she passed away as she knew my dad would be a douche about the money. I confront my dad about the money, 25 years after he swindled me out of it. he denies it, then tries to claim the amount was 10% of what it truly was, and with every lie I bring out what I remember to be the truth, along with evidence. Eventually I tell him never to contact me again, and stop answering his messages. He tries to message me once a while, but it's more and more random. Turns out that it looks like he has early stages of dementia.

A few months later some distant family contacts us, asking why I have no contact with my father, because he reached out to them to talk, and he 'seems lonely' (we suspect the bride leaves him alone at home because with dementia he is a handful and she doesn't want to deal with him). We tell them what happened and they understand. As time passes, his sister is now asking me to forgive him for what he did and to free my soul from these shackles (as she calls it).

My reply was from the series Billions ‚ÄúHate is nature's most perfect energy source. It's endlessly renewable.‚Äù I have no urge to forgive him, but **AITA** for not forgiving??"

She‚Äôs always working, which I‚Äôd forgive, but then I see her making time for her friends. Laughing on the phone, talking for hours, giving them the energy and attention I wish I had from her.

I realized I‚Äôm just a background character in her life, and I don‚Äôt want to show up to her wedding just to play the role of ‚Äúsupportive sister‚Äù for the pictures. It feels fake. I want a bond, not just the title of ‚Äúsister.‚Äù"

He hasn't physically seen them since Christmas when he dropped off gifts and before that he hadn't seen them since July (to drop off birthday gifts but was late doing that). He hasn't physically had them in his care since they were about 2 years old. He doesn't call to talk to them, doesn't text me asking about them and when I suggested that they start to get to know him again by all of us meeting at the park, he got angry and said that they are HIS kids too and I should just drop them off with him at his new place (with his new gf that I've never met) and if they're uncomfortable, they'll learn to get over it. Our daughter has a bit of an anxiety issue and our son has a mild form of autism and since I have been the only consistent parent in their life, leaving them would cause them both to flip out.   I've been debating on if I should just be the bigger person and invite him to their graduation but part of me feels like not even bothering. He has always had the same work schedule and I know he would make an excuse that he can't go into work late even though the ceremony is only MAYBE an hour long and he'd not miss work.  I feel like if he really wanted to be in their life, he would make the effort but he does nothing but show up with gifts...

People in my family and my friends keep saying I'm the asshole as she's family and has every right to want to see my daughter but the thing is she wants to see my daughter but not me...so aitah"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I talk to my sister about my pregnancy?,7,2025-05-01 21:37:42,34,"Would I be the AH if I talk to my sister about me finding out I‚Äôm pregnant and plan to abort? I'm hesitatant to talk to her but I really need to talk to some other than my boyfriend. I know she's pro-choice, but I feel like I would be insensitive if I talk to her. For context, she has struggled with fertility. I think for the reason alone, I shouldn't tell her. 

I‚Äôm wondering if I would be the AH for talking to my sister about abortion when she‚Äôs had fertility problems. I‚Äôm not interested in anyone‚Äôs pro-life arguments in regard to my personal health, decision, and choice. 

Update: I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs best to not discuss things with my sister. We have a good relationship and I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize that. 

I‚Äôm going to discuss counseling services at Planned Parenthood when I go because I don‚Äôt have anyone else who I can trust. Thank y‚Äôall for your input and understanding. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not putting in for time off again?,7,2025-05-01 20:52:20,36,"I am a local truck driver (29m) making decent money at a shit job. I work a lot of hours and never really get time with my wife aside from when we are being parents to our 2 year old daughter.

My wife is going to a big city for a birthday weekend with her friends and wants me to join because the girls are bringing their husbands . I really want to go because we never get time with each other and I want to get out with people again because I don‚Äôt wanna be depressed and isolated anymore .

So I put in for unpaid leave because I don‚Äôt have the time off and I got denied. A lot of things have been denied recently and I‚Äôve already been looking at different jobs and that denial just gave me one more reason to try to get out asap.

My wife wants me to keep putting in time off requests for the date and told me if they confront me, to just say that I‚Äôm going and they‚Äôll have to deal with that because it‚Äôs already a planned thing .

My argument is that yes,I‚Äôm trying to get out of this job anyway but I can‚Äôt be bold like that because I could potentially be let go. I‚Äôd rather leave on my own terms "
amitheasshole,AITA for backing out of a luxury hen do even though it‚Äôs for my best friend?,11,2025-05-01 19:05:19,24,"I (33F, UK) am supposed to go on my best friend Sarah‚Äôs (34F) hen do later this year. It‚Äôs mainly organised by her older sister Christine (36F), the maid of honour. There are about 10 of us (ages 30‚Äì36), including Sarah‚Äôs younger sister Paige (30F), another of my best friends. I‚Äôve known all three sisters for 29 years, been close since childhood. The rest are her friends from school and uni.

The original plan was a luxury European island trip. Christine shared a spreadsheet packed with expensive activities, and the group voted. Everyone (except Paige and me) picked the priciest option: a villa (¬£4k for 4 nights), plus ¬£400+ flights (not including luggage). Planned extras included boat hire, spa days, strippers, private chef, daily meals out, clubbing, etc.

Privately, Paige and I agreed we couldn‚Äôt afford it. She‚Äôs ¬£25k+ in debt. When she told Christine and asked to compromise, Christine got angry, called her selfish and accused her of always thinking about herself.

I‚Äôm not doing great either. I just moved into my own place, furnished it solo, and have over ¬£1,500 in credit card debt. Most of my income goes to rent, bills, food, and my cats. The hen do would mean adding ¬£1‚Äì1.5k more debt. I suggested going for fewer days but was told I‚Äôd still need to pay the full share of accommodation.

Eventually, Paige and I said in the group we couldn‚Äôt afford it. Two others then said the same. Before this, I‚Äôd spoken privately to Sarah, she was super understanding and said she cared more about us all being there than flashy plans. She even joked she‚Äôd canoe instead of hiring a boat if it meant we could come.

We compromised: changed destinations, found ¬£150 flights, and booked two beachfront apartments. Sarah was brought into planning again (she‚Äôd been left out for the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù).

But now costs are creeping up again: it's become a 10-bed villa with a huge pool, and extras like boat hire, spa days, strippers, and clubbing are still expected. Truthfully, I can‚Äôt afford this trip at all. I want to go for Sarah, but even the basics would go on my credit card. I might be willing to take on some debt to be there, but not hundreds more for extras I don‚Äôt want.

Paige and I plan to join one or two activities and a couple of meals or a nightclub but otherwise keep it sensible. We won‚Äôt just sit out, we just can‚Äôt afford it all... or even most of it, tbh.

I work 6 days a week in hospitality and study 2 days. I literally have no days off. I can‚Äôt justify spending thousands I don‚Äôt have, especially when I‚Äôll likely be judged for not doing every expensive activity.

I‚Äôm also going to the wedding (2-hour drive and overnight stay), and there‚Äôs a second hen do in London for those who couldn‚Äôt come.

So, AITA if I don‚Äôt go at all? Or if I go but only do what I can afford?

I love Sarah and want to celebrate her, I just don‚Äôt want to cripple myself financially. I feel really guilty and stuck."
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my sister borrow my car?,14,2025-05-01 16:52:27,26,"So basically she wants to drive an hour away to another city to do a bunch of stuff some of which she seems hesitant to tell me. My mother previously gave her a car years back but she wrecked it. I also had an accident with my last car when I was learning how to drive but it was while parking so the car only had a few scratches. Nevertheless, it was my fault and my insurance went up from an already high rate (I was 17 at the time now 19). The last car transmission went so Mother brought me the car I have now. The issue that I have is that if she wrecks it I won't be getting another car from my mother and my insurance would skyrocket. She hasn't been driving for quite some time and she‚Äôs not exactly familiar with my car. I need it to get to school. I offered to drive her but she seemed to get annoyed.  I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking the risk."
amitheasshole,AITA that I told my {f27}mother {63f} she disrespected my boyfriend {29m}?,30,2025-05-01 13:46:31,75,"So context.
My boyfriend and I had taken my parents to the airport last week, he‚Äôs a Latino man and he‚Äôs proud of it. 

He was born in the us but both his parents are immigrants so he grew up in a traditional Hispanic household, which he is proud of and always talks about it. My mother knows of his background and how he takes his culture seriously, and she knows he speaks Spanish and listens to Spanish music.

Well, last week him and I were taking my parents to the airport in his car, he had Spanish music playing on the radio which is normal for me because we usually listen to it. My dad is a funny guy so he jokingly said I didn‚Äôt know we were all Spanish and then dropped it after my boyfriend laughed. My mother took it too far and said ‚Äúwe are seriously not listening to Spanish music‚Äù, ‚Äúyou were born here. You‚Äôre American.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt speak fluent Spanish.‚Äù I have never heard her speak like this and I was taken back, I knew he was feeling off after that and I felt so bad. I didn‚Äôt say anything in the moment because I was just too shocked, today I told her how he felt and she goes well he‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBaby and I said nothing wrong. He‚Äôs even told me he doesn‚Äôt speak fluent Spanish.‚Äù I was like are you dumb? You know he does you‚Äôve heard him.. now she‚Äôs trying to say he‚Äôs a liar and that he‚Äôs no good for me.

amitheasshole,AITA for asking a mom in a theater to watch her kids?,5,2025-05-01 22:38:42,9,"i was at the movie theater and from the second i sat down there were 2 kids (maybe between 5-8yrs old) running up and down the aisle, even going all the way to the back of the theater. they were not watching the movie at all, going up to strangers in the aisles, and playing with each other. halfway into the movie, the littlest one grabbed my foot and tried to jump into my seat with me. that was the final straw for me. i got up from my seat and went to their mom and said, ‚Äúcan you please get your kids? they keep coming up to me and other people.‚Äù 

i went back to my seat before she responded. she then got up and did grab her kids, but stopped by me and angrily told me, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre kids. i can‚Äôt keep them still. if you don‚Äôt like it you can leave.‚Äù

the kids kept running around the theater for the rest of the movie, but they didn‚Äôt come to me again so i didn‚Äôt bother going up to her a second time. she obviously didn‚Äôt care. and genuinely, she seemed like she would start a genuine fight over this.

could i have handled this better??

amitheasshole,AITA for being nervous to visit a friend in the hospital that has a dangerous bacterial infection,6,2025-05-01 21:22:50,14,"I recently learned a friend of mine is in the hospital for a bacterial infection that had gotten quite serious and required a surgery to remove the infected tissue. I visited him with another friend‚Äôs and under the impression that it was something that could not be transmitted easily. We were not given any PPE when visiting him. While I was there I sat on a chair in his room etc. The next day another friend visited him and by then they had figured out that he actually had a very dangerous infection and they made her wear gloves and PPE before entering. I got a bit scared especially since I‚Äôm someone who wear contacts and I remember I touched things in his rooms. Of course I always wash my hands before  handling my contacts and taking them out, but that irrational part of my brain started going off. I freaked out and asked my friends should I be worried. They seem to be annoyed with me for asking/freaking out. They implied that I should be more worried about him, but I never said I wasn‚Äôt, I was just freaking out. 

Anyways knowing this I wanted to go see him again, and they warned me saying that I better not ‚Äúact like this‚Äù in front of him, which I obviously would not. When they were going as a group which we planned, they did not let me know and specifically did not text me. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the asshole from my mini freak out. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply I don‚Äôt care about him, rather I‚Äôve never come into contact with MRSA patient. Also I would never go to see him again and freak out in front of him, I was mostly nervous since they had not given us PPE when we entered his room the first time."
amitheasshole,AITA for expecting my siblings partners to split the bill,72,2025-05-01 07:04:33,60,"My family (mom, dad, brother with partner and two kids, sister with partner and two kids, brother w/o partner and kids and me w/o partner and kids) are going on family vacation soon. My parents are paying for flight tickets and housing, for everyone, so we have decided that the rest of us will pay for food the entire trip. 
A while back we had a situation where some of us were paying for dinner for my parents, but when we went to split the bill, we split it threefold (my brother and my sisters partner were not there), as in my brothers partner was not paying. I did have a reaction to this, because I figured that all adults would be paying for themselves, as everyone ate. I obviously don‚Äôt mind paying a part for the kids, but just felt it was weird for her not to pay a part.
We talked about it, she did not pay, but I was fine with that considering the amount was not too big, but expressed that in the future they might be considerate that when two have partners(both have their own income) and two don‚Äôt, me and my single brother will always be paying a bigger share if the partners don‚Äôt pay for themselves.
As we are going on this vacation, we are paying for the food. We are obviously super lucky that our parents are paying for the rest of the trip, but the amount for the food will be considerably bigger than last time this was an issue. It has not yet been specified if we are splitting between the four siblings or if the partners are paying too. As I said I am happy to be paying for the kids and my parents, but as the partners are getting a free trip too, and they are both two income families, I feel it only makes sense that they pay for themselves. I‚Äôm scared to bring it up, as it is an uncomfortable subject, but I really don‚Äôt want to be paying more just because I‚Äôm single. If we all had partners it would be different, but as I see it, me and my single brother will be paying ‚Äúdouble‚Äù if we split it by four. Am I the asshole for bringing this up, and expecting the partner to pay their share?"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my roommate to get rid of a kitten,345,2025-04-30 22:34:28,134,"I have a house and rent out one of the rooms that I don‚Äôt use. I currently have 2 dogs and a friend of a friend was looking for a place to stay. She said she had a cat and one of my dogs isn‚Äôt cat friendly. I told her as long as she‚Äôs fine keeping the cat in her room for majority of the day I don‚Äôt mind a cat. 

A couple months go by and as I‚Äôm parking I notice two cats in her window. I asked her about it and she said she‚Äôs just watching it for a couple days and the second cat isn‚Äôt hers. That turned out to be a lie as days turned into months. She said the previous owner of the cat can‚Äôt keep it and it will have to go to a shelter if she doesn‚Äôt take it in. 

I wasn‚Äôt too happy but after talking to some friends I thought what‚Äôs one more cat going to do. She seems to take good care of her cat and if she‚Äôs fine keeping both in a room I‚Äôll live. One cat was a female and the other was a male and I asked if both or one is fixed and she said they both were

Anyways we‚Äôve been living together for a little over a year now. 2 months ago she comes home from work and texts me saying her cat just gave birth and she didn‚Äôt know she was pregnant. I was very annoyed because she told me her cats were fixed, how did she get pregnant? I told her she needs to get rid of the cat asap as I don‚Äôt want a third living here. That‚Äôs 5 animals in one house. She told me she doesn‚Äôt want a third cat either and her mom will take it in

About 3 weeks pass and I ask her when is her mom going to get the kitten and she says her mom can‚Äôt take the cat anymore. I told her I don‚Äôt care who takes the cat I just want it gone by the end of the month.

It‚Äôs been 2 months. Everytime I ask her she just says she can‚Äôt find a home for the cat. Today I told her if she doesn‚Äôt get rid of the cat by the end of next month I‚Äôll have to kick her out. And it turned into an argument. I told her I‚Äôm not going to change my mind and I‚Äôm set on not wanting another animal in my house and told her it‚Äôs not fair to keep 3 cats in a tiny bedroom all day. It‚Äôs gross and unsanitary. She ended up going to her room and said I‚Äôm being an asshole since she‚Äôs trying to get rid of it 

I feel as though I‚Äôve given her plenty of time to find a new home for the cat. Some of my friends say I shouldn‚Äôt be too hard and some agree with me. Do you guys have any advice on what I should do?

Edit for some info I forgot to include: when she first told me her cat gave birth I asked her how because her cats were fixed. She said she thought they were. The past 2 months I‚Äôve told her she needs to get them fixed soon because her cat can get pregnant again and it will be a lot of trauma on her cat. She said she‚Äôs trying but has not even made an appointment to get her cats fixed"
amitheasshole,AITA? My daughter knows I'm the Easter Bunny,79,2025-05-01 06:30:28,56,"I (43f) & my husband (42m) have an 8 year old daughter who LOVES Easter. It's always been her favorite holiday. When she was 3 she made us hide/find empty plastic eggs every day for months. 

Over the years I've increased the effort I put into it for her. What started as a small hunt for a few plastic eggs with chocolates inside has evolved into an elaborate scavenger hunt with riddles and clues and gifts like a new outfit and a few books plus candy. Daughter loves it, I love doing it for her. Husband has never been involved in any way other than to tell me it's cute. 

This year a few weeks before Easter, daughter confessed that she knows the Easter Bunny/Santa is just parents. No big deal, she still got the whole to-do and it was a lot of fun. 

Then last night at dinner, daughter made a comment about ""Mom and Dad being the Easter Bunny"" and I said without thinking ""no it's just Mom"". Husband's mood immediately soured and we later got in a fight about it. 

He thinks all gifts should be from both of us because ""we're a team"". I think that I'm the one who spent all that money and time to make a magical experience for our kid while he did literally nothing, so why should I have to share the credit. Am I wrong? 

EDIT: Some of y'all are reading a bit too much into this. 

I don't resent my husband and I'm not trying to be in competition with him. Or to put my kid in the middle of some fight. This is just a thing I do for my kid to make her happy, and a careless comment made without thinking. He does other things with her and is a great dad. I saw this was more of a 'mom/Dad are different people and show their love in different ways"" kind of thing and didn't really think it was a big deal. But after reading some of the yta comments I can see how he might feel differently, so I'll talk to him about it."
amitheasshole,AITA For buying my girlfriend‚Äôs dead dog a head stone?,7,2025-05-01 19:13:21,44,"In 2013, my girlfriend‚Äôs dog passed away, and she shared with me that both her parents and she miss him dearly. Later, I discovered that she had a grave for him on her property, and she had purchased a few items for it, including a solar light and a small turtle statue. We‚Äôve have been dating since September 2024, but I have known her for over six years. I wanted to express my gratitude to her and her family for sharing a personal story about their beloved dog with me. Therefore, I purchased a headstone and inscribed his name, date of birth, date of death, and a paw print with a small heart. Since I am in the military and reside in different states, I had the headstone sent to her house. Upon receiving it, she became deeply saddened, explaining that the departure of her dog was a somber event, and that is the reason why they had never had a memorial erected for him. This realization has left me feeling remorseful and uncertain about how to proceed."
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to go to my sister‚Äôs wedding?,293,2025-04-30 22:24:27,141,"Me and my sister are very close. She got engaged a while ago and is about to have a big wedding. She invited a bunch of people, letting everyone bring a plus one, if they have a partner. Since I do not have one, I asked whether I could bring my best friend, due to the fact that I do not know a lot of people that are coming to the wedding, apart from my family, who I am not really close with. She told me no, since the plus ones should only be the guests‚Äô long-term partners and I did not have an issue with that, because I understand that weddings are expensive and every additional person would mean that they would have more expenses. I was okay with that until recently, when I found out that she let one of our cousins bring her boy best friend. I was obviously upset since the said cousin was the only one I got along with and this would mean that I would be more or less alone the whole time and as mentioned before, she said that the plus ones should only be the guests‚Äô long term partners. She then proceeded to completely shut me off, by saying that the cousin helped her with coming up with decorations and she is going to be doing her makeup for her wedding. I feel completely wronged, since I help her with her 10 month old baby that I come and babysit everyday for a couple of hours so she can have some alone time and because she is understandably exhausted, I look after her dog almost every month when she and her fianc√©e go on a holiday, I helped her pick and find her wedding and after party dress, I helped her with decorations too so I really do not understand how I‚Äôve done any less than the cousin. It‚Äôs not just about me inviting my friend, it‚Äôs also about the fact that I completely feel unappreciated and dismissed when I devote so much time to make her life easier whilst I‚Äôm working and going to school. We haven‚Äôt had much time to talk after the argument, but I plan to tell her I‚Äôm not coming. I know it‚Äôs her wedding and her big day, but I really don‚Äôt want to go after feeling completely dismissed like this so AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA - Giving sugar to my toddler,1168,2025-04-30 14:20:11,390,"My wife and I have a 4 year old daughter together. My daughter doesn‚Äôt drink enough water in a day. If we give her a cup of water, she will have just a few sips rather than finish the entire cup more often than not. So what I like to do is add some juice to that cup of water to make it flavorful so she drinks more and is well hydrated throughout the day. Usually, the cup is filled 90% water and 10% organic orange juice. She will drink that entire cup 3-4 times per day. The past two days my daughter has complained her tummy hurts. My wife blames me for adding juice to her water. My wife has always taken issue with that drink and shes very adamant about how we should give her only water and no juice at all because of the sugar.

amitheasshole,"AITA for how I reacted when a ""neighbour"" tried to talk to me",169,2025-05-01 00:11:44,31,"Hi reddit I just wanted to post here because I'm second guessing myself 
A bit of backstory I (28) F have an 18 month old son that is in the phase of not sleeping during the day unless it's in the car this means that during the weekend I take a drive during the day so he can fall asleep and usually drive back to my house and park at the front with the aircon on until he's in a deep sleep. 

Now about a week ago my partner was out helping his sister with yard work and I was alone with our 18 month old son and he needed a day sleep so I went driving and when he was asleep parked out the front of our house. I started to play some games on my phone and I hear 2 knocks on my car window and it's a middle aged looking man maybe in his late 30s or mid 40s  who was signaling for me to wind down my window at first I thought he might of been asking me to move my car or something since our street is pretty small and I'm not parked in the driveway. 

He then asks if I live there and points to my house and I said yes he then said ""I live around here to, I just wanna get to know you, you seem like the kinda girl I wanna get to know"" this creeped me out a lot especially with my son in the car. 

this is where I could be the asshole I smiled at him but then just winded my window back up and then locked the car doors. I then gave him a little wave to sorta say"" no thanks, I'm good mate"" but then he knocked on my window again another 3-4 times trying to ask me to wind the window down again and I just smiled and shook my head saying no and he then realised I wasn't going to wind it down and then walked down to the end of the street. While he was banging my son woke up so when he walked all the way down the street I then got my son out of the car and then went inside the house and locked my doors. 

I think it's important to note that I've never seen this man before in my life and I've lived in my street for about 3 years now but I don't know a lot of my neighbours because we live in duplexs and everyone sorta keeps to themselves and I haven't seen him since this incident but I can't help to feel a little bad because I'm not sure if he was being a creep or just didn't speak English well and was trying to get to know his neighbours, so AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not offering to pay for gas?,3,2025-05-01 21:56:27,46,"In my friend group, we have one friend who always drives. Two of us don‚Äôt have cars, I get driving anxiety, and the girl who drives is really comfortable with it. 

If we‚Äôre going on longer trips, we split gas evenly, but I never paid for gas otherwise. I figured that she would be going anyway and it doesn‚Äôt add expense to take the rest of us along. We all live under 10 min apart too so drop offs aren‚Äôt hard. But I recently realized that the two other girls have been sending a few bucks or buying her coffee every so often for driving all the time. And they were shocked that I wasn‚Äôt especially because we do go to the other side of town pretty often. Basically said it was an AH move of me. One of them commented that I probably owe a pretty large amount over the few years we‚Äôve known each other.

That friend told the driving friend, who brushed it off and told her it‚Äôs fine, but that friend is now saying it‚Äôs because she is non-confrontational and I need to be paying without being asked. Now our dynamics in the group are very awkward and stressful.

I‚Äôm kind of taken aback with all of this because our friend has never once asked for gas money. Doesn‚Äôt even ask for parking but we automatically pay her for it. I know that she also makes more money than the rest of us and is very frugal so financially she‚Äôs in a good spot and does not need it. 

I didn‚Äôt really think it was necessary because she would be spending the gas money anyway even if we drove separately. And she‚Äôs made it clear she doesn‚Äôt need it. AITA for not offering to pay for gas?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not planning a SECOND wedding to cater to my father?,814,2025-04-30 14:38:51,134,"Buckle up, it‚Äôs a long ride. 

My father and I have been no contact for at least five years now. Long story short, his wife (I refuse to call her a step mother) was terrible to me my entire childhood. She controlled every aspect of his life and brainwashed him into thinking I was an evil malicious person.

Well from the time of no contact up until last year I had assumed he and his wife had moved back to our home state a thousand miles away. Last year out of nowhere his wife texted me and invited me to Easter dinner. SURPRISE!! They still lived in the same state and town as me. I went to that Easter dinner and figured we could start rebuilding a relationship. 

 Fast forward to this week. My fianc√© and I had finally settled on a date and destination for our wedding. We are going to get married 5 hours away from where we live because that‚Äôs where most of my family and his family live now. I had gone back and forth debating whether or not to invite my father because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt come anyway and didn‚Äôt want to deal with the disappointment. My sister essentially guilt tripped me into inviting him saying he would never miss my wedding, he isn‚Äôt that shitty (he attended both of my other sisters weddings) Since I already invited his whole side of the family (who all live 30 min from the wedding destination) I said screw it and extended the invite to him and his wife. 

After a few days of no response his wife calls me (pf course he wouldn‚Äôt call me himself) and tells me my father will not be attending due to the fact that I invited my Gramz (his mother, who I have always had a good relationship with) and he refuses to be around her. His wife then proceeds to give me excuse after excuse about how terribly my Gramz treated him and how it would be detrimental for him to be in the same vicinity as her. I was heartbroken. She then told me how malicious and selfish of me it was to plan the wedding at that destination and invite my Gramz bc I was setting my father up forcing him to see her. 

This now brings us to her ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù. Why don‚Äôt I plan a SECOND wedding where we live and I don‚Äôt invite my Gramz so that he can attend LOL.

Essentially I‚Äôm supposed to rearrange all of my plans and compromise to cater to my father and his needs, rather than him compromise and be around my Gramz for a few hours. So AITA for not planning a second wedding the day before my real wedding?

Edit: after I declined to ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù his wife then proceeded to have a hissy fit and tell me he would come if he has to but made sure to let me know how miserable he would be the whole time. Needless to say, I revoked my original invite to them, blocked them both and have gone no contact with them again. 


Edit: my Gramz was also at my sisters wedding that he attended. So I know it‚Äôs all just an excuse to not come. I have always been treated differently than my sisters and outcasted by my father and his wifebut had hopes now that after so many years we could reconcile. "
amitheasshole,AITA for cutting contacts with my ex cause I wasn't aware of us dating..,2,2025-05-01 22:08:49,12,"I (16F) and my ex (17M) have been together 3 times in our time of knowing each other. I'll give some backstory for why we broke up so many times. 

The first time I dumped him was because he had jerked off on a call with me TWICE and showed me his dick on a snap. Second time I felt guilty for getting back with him and the last time he was jealous of my best friend (16M) even though he had a crush on his best friend/my childhood friend (17F). And the day after I had dumped him he texted me ""I'm cutting myself you've destroyed my mental health"" even though he's always had bad mental health and drank monsters till he pukes to cope. 

He asked me to be his girlfriend a month ago and I said ""Sorry no, I do still like you but it never worked out plus my friends and family won't be happy"" and he took it. fast forward to my friend's (16M) birthday party he had told his other best friend (17M) that me and him were dating. which I never said yes to.. his best friend and his other friends thought I was aware and I wasn't. 

I texted him two days later (the day I found out we were supposedly dating) saying ""Hey I wasn't aware we were dating at all?? sorry I do like you but us is not a good idea.""he took the text great. But ever since he's been a complete and utter asshole to everyone around him. 

purposely breaking stuff, causing arguments, ignoring people etc.. last week at my friend's house (the same guy who had the birthday party) we done the ice bucket challenge but before we started he dunked his head in the ice water and shook his head like fucking dog.  my phone charger was in the area and he knew I had history with getting new chargers due to water damage. I yelled at him if he wants to act like a dog he can be one. and he said ""ohhh someone's mad!""

so Am I The Asshole? "

I am 24 and my Fianc√© is 26, we are freshly engaged and moving in with each other soon. Well about a week ago, my mom and her husband had a bad crash out and are now getting a divorce. I have tried to send her apartments and condos, but she keeps saying she could just move in with us and get a house with us for a year while the divorce settles. I love her and i would do absolutely anything for her but this is a lot. I‚Äôve cried and been upset with myself. But part of me thinks this is asking a lot of me and my fianc√©. We are just now starting our lives together and it just seems like so much to put on our relationship right now. Please help. "
amitheasshole,WIBTA If I (F28) go to court against my mother (F50),221,2025-04-30 20:16:00,64,"My father died in an accident back in 2020. There was a wrongful death suit as he was killed by a commercial vehicle. The total paid to my family was $2m. My mother decided that her, myself, and my brothers would split it equally. Legally, the spouse is entitled to 75% and children are entitled to split 25% amongst themselves. So this was very generous of her. She did this out of her own free will and said she felt this was the most fair option. 

Five years later, there‚Äôs been a lot of drama in my family due to my mom. We were close but then last year she started talking to a man in Vegas (we live in the Midwest) and married him in secret at some point. I have no idea when she got married. She let us know she‚Äôd be moving out there and left my 17 year old brother alone with 11 days notice. She paid the mortgage and utilities but he was responsible for food, clothes, etc. During this time she also used one of my siblings credit to sign up for some credit cards and then defaulted on those.

During this, I was pregnant and postpartum. My husband and I are very blessed but it added to my stress a lot.

I recently got a letter from an attorney with an affidavit to sign saying that I am waiving my claim to any money I‚Äôm eligible for in an insurance payout. I had never heard anything about this so I called. The attorney represents my dad‚Äôs car insurance. It‚Äôs $50k that‚Äôs being paid out to all immediate family members. Family can decide how money is divided or go before a judge. To be clear, I am 100% legally entitled to a portion of this. This isn‚Äôt a situation where it‚Äôs legally going to my mother and we‚Äôre trying to find a loophole.

The attorney said they‚Äôve been in contact with my mom for over 6 months. She said we had agreed to her getting everything and she‚Äôd decide how to divide it. The attorney couldn‚Äôt move forward without our signatures so I got that letter.

I called my mom and she was wishy-washy. She said we were signing an agreement not to sue and said she signed it. She didn‚Äôt mention anything about money. She visited me a few weeks later and I talked to her. She said since she‚Äôd been so generous it was a given that all of this would go to her. So she didn‚Äôt tell us because it was so obvious.

It‚Äôs not life changing money. But I did just have a baby and it would help put my family into a better spot while we might be headed into a recession. If my mom had come to me upfront and asked for the money there‚Äôs a good chance I would have been alright with it. But at this point, I can‚Äôt deny that she likely tried to lie about get the insurance payout without any of us knowing. 

So, should I move forward with going to court if my mom won‚Äôt negotiate? Or am I being selfish and my mom should be entitled to all of it? 

My father would not have wanted all of it to go to my mom. But they had a bad relationship so I can‚Äôt use that as a metric to make my decision. "
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my dad to help my disabled mother?,90,2025-05-01 01:07:23,39,"I 18M was cooking dinner for my family without their help. I was dealing with our noodles and I needed to start something steaming and I could only do so much at once. my father 55M got up and poured himself a glass of tea when I asked him to pour a glass for my mother 56F. He completely ignored my request. I thought he was going to set his down and make one for her but he just sat down. I asked him if he didn't hear me of if he just chose to ignore me. He then got mad at me and said how I always try to boss him around and he wasn't going to go out of his way to do that. My mom said it was fine and to stop fighting. I usually make tea for my mother because she's disabled and struggles to walk. 

For context this was after my dad got off of work and I got off of school. Also my father wasn't in pain and he worked for 8 hours. I reminded him who was cooking the food but he didn't care. I also went over to my grandma's house to fix the cage that protects her truck while my grandfather is currently in the hospital. My father just talked with my grandma while I fixed it. I know he's stressed but he's been getting more of an asshole aswell as becoming father and father right wing.  So all things considered, am I the asshole??"
amitheasshole,AITA for throwing out my pushy girlfriend's father's things from our house?,438,2025-04-30 16:24:41,167,"So, lets start with background. I have been living with my girlfriend for about 2 years now. About 8 months ago, we decided to get a house together, with a marriage to follow soon after. The house is considerably closer to her parents' house than our old apartment. On the day we moved in, her father brought us a mezuzah for the front door to put outside. I am not Jewish and neither is she, we are both Christians who don't attend church. He is the only Jewish one, and he converted to Judaism from Christianity. We tried to tell him that it wouldn't really make sense for us to hang it, but he insisted that we needed to. It got close to an argument. 

Since then, he has brought many more Jewish religious items into our house and insisted we keep them. Neither me nor my girlfriend were big fans, but we didn't want to be rude. He was very enthusiastic. As of a few weeks ago, most of the house was decorated with Jewish imagery, and he was still bringing more. I didn't want to say anything direct, and neither did my girlfriend. We wanted to avoid awkward confrontation. I've repeatedly told him as nicely as I can that neither of us are Jewish and that we don't need these items. 

Over time, I began to get feelings of anxiety. About two weeks ago, I had an extended feeling of being trapped. A house that me and my girlfriend paid for was being decorated in a way we didn't want, and we had no recourse that wouldn't cause problems. I got very upset thinking about how it was supposed to be our house to decorate. My girlfriend had planned such a nice aesthetic, and all these things from her father were impeding on it. So I took a few trash bags, threw everything in them, and put them on the curb. Trash pickup was the next day, and now it's all gone. For a few days, I felt so relieved. It felt like the house was ours again. Then he visited. 

He immediately questioned where everything was, and we got into a verbal fight when I explained what I had done. It was brief, and ended when he stormed out of the house. My girlfriend stayed out of the argument. Since then, he has not visited. AITA?"
amitheasshole,"AITA for saying a girl I brought into my friend group was toxic, and then being kicked out of the group because of it?",5,2025-05-01 19:23:17,20,"I had a group of friends, three of whom I was especially close with. Then I met a girl who told me she used to be obese, was bullied, never had any friends, and was very insecure. I felt bad for her and thought she seemed sweet, so I invited her to a big birthday party my friends threw for me and introduced her to everyone.

At the party, she gave massages to guys in one of the rooms and made out with multiple people. Some of my friends didn‚Äôt like her - especially the girls and the gay guys - but I asked them to give her a chance.

After the party, she started hanging out with many of my friends, often without me.

She told me the friend who introduced us (who I‚Äôve known for years and is extremely open-minded and kind) was judging her and ‚Äúslut-shaming‚Äù her. That didn‚Äôt sound like her, but I believed it at the time.

She became very sexual - wearing pants with cutouts over her butt, sleeping with every guy in the circle (sometimes multiple at one party). I never judged her - I believe in live and let live. She said she was finally getting male attention for the first time, so I thought, ‚ÄúGood for her.‚Äù

One of my gay friends had tried to set me up with a guy. I wasn‚Äôt super into him, but then people started saying he was gay and sleeping with the friend who set us up. It made me feel confused and kind of stupid. Much later I found out she‚Äôd hit on that guy, and when he wasn‚Äôt interested, she started that rumor.

She once told me one of my oldest friends ‚Äúisn‚Äôt mad at you anymore - I talked to him and explained what a nice person you are.‚Äù This confused me. Why would he be mad? He had just met her. I called him and he said he had no idea what I was talking about and that I was being paranoid.

Then she hit on a guy who was in a relationship. His girlfriend - who I‚Äôm friends with - was out of town. I pulled her aside and said maybe it wasn‚Äôt a good idea. I thought she was socially awkward and didn‚Äôt realize how she came across. Her response was basically, ‚ÄúWhy should I care about his girlfriend?‚Äù

Later I found out she told one friend I was secretly in love with him (not true) and another that I broke her website - when I had actually built it for her and paid for everything myself.

Eventually I realized she was manipulating people - not by lying directly, but by implying things like, ‚ÄúWhy is everyone upset that X said that?‚Äù which planted ideas. I distanced myself and told my friends I thought she was toxic.

But somehow, she convinced three of my closest friends that I was bullying her. One ghosted me, one got mean and said I was just jealous and slut-shaming, and one thought I should apologize.

I ended up pushed out of the group. Some people were on my side, but it didn‚Äôt help. I still don‚Äôt know the full scope of what she lied about. It still hurts. I thought eventually they will find out who she truly is but it‚Äôs been almost three years, and they‚Äôre all still friends with her instead of me. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for kicking my sister out of my house?,235,2025-04-30 19:33:24,56,"About mid March my sister said she didn‚Äôt have anywhere to go as her lease was up and she couldn‚Äôt afford to keep living in the apartment she was in, and said she needed somewhere for a month to get enough money to save to get a new place. I conveniently thought I needed a pet sitter for a month because I was supposed to be out of town working, so I offered her to stay with me free, and in return she could watch my cats. She agreed and that was that.. so I thought. Come April I didn‚Äôt actually get the job I was going to be away for so I was home most of the month. About two weeks ago I got offered to work another job out of town for 3 days and asked her if she would be there to watch my cats for me for the weekend and she said yes. Come Thursday before I leave on that Friday she goes out at night and doesn‚Äôt come back the next morning. I text her asking if she‚Äôs going to be back soon and she said no she‚Äôs out for the weekend. At this point I kind of lost it. She couldn‚Äôt just stay home for 3 days for me, after I let her live with me free for the entire month upon the original agreement of pet sitting in the first place. She was spending it with her boyfriend instead of doing me the one thing I asked for which sent me over the edge more, and on top of that she also has her own cat she was going to leave all that time alone. So it all blew up and I told her she has to move out that day, and get her things before I leave Friday. She then had the audacity to say she needed to keep her cat there until the next day and I said not my problem since you can‚Äôt watch my cats. On top of the whole pet string issue she would daily make fun of my weight so I think this all just sent me over the edge. Am I the asshole or too harsh?"
amitheasshole,AITA for getting angry bc my mom cleaned my room?,2,2025-05-01 21:00:33,31,"I (F17) have a pretty messy room. It's deffo on the messier side of things, but I know where things are and I can find things with ease. 

Recently I've been swamped bc of school work, working and trying to maintain friendships, so I don't really have time for my room.

My mom hates my room, and has went as far as to rearrange it twice because she hated how messy it is.  Not tidying. Rearranging. So she moved my bed, my drawers, my bookshelf, everything.

The first time I asked her why she did that but just tried to let it slide. I did mention that I wanted it rearranged back, but months past, and I eventually made it my bedroom again and I was comfortable. 

The second time, I got back from hanging out with my friends and she had rearranged it back to what it was before. I got furious at her for it and felt bad, but justified. We had an argument on ""You wanted it back to how it was"" and ""That was months ago I asked you"" and all of this and that.

Then I got over it and moved on. So I was coming home from school, exhausted. I hadn't been sleeping right, I've had homework spewing from my bag, I just couldn't. 

So I went inside and saw bits of my room all around the place. I saw my drawers emptied and flipped over, ornaments just lying around, basically my house had become a sort of museum of my stuff.

I go upstairs and I'm exhausted and I see my room, nearly empty, with all my clothes on the floor. I ask why this is, too exhausted to even function, and my mom tells me that she's tidied my room for me. I was about to cry atp.

Then she asked me to organise my clothes and put them away, and I said something but I can't remember what (sorry) and she just said ""Right, I'll do it!"" and she put my clothes back in the wrong place? 

Like it's way overdramatic, but she put jackets hanging in my wardrobe (something I hate), jeans not in the jeans spot, dresses folded into drawers. She reorganised my bookshelf, she completely changed how my room is meant to go. I had everything in the wrong place. It wasn't my room, it was my own uncanny valley.

So I have to sleep because I'm just so angry and exhausted and I sleep for 5 hours, then go into her room and tell her off. 

I say how she's messed up my room and I've told her 3 times before to stop.

She said how she cleaned it.

I told her how it's reorganised and that it's completely different to cleaning.

Now she's furious with me bc she thinks she's done something nice, but it feels like she's gone through all my things (some things I don't want her to look through aswell) and has just changed how my room is. 

It also looks like too normalish? Like she put away all my weird stuff. Like I had an umbrella hat that I loved and she tried putting it away into the corner of my room where noone could see it???

AITA for getting mad over this?

amitheasshole,AITA For walking away while my grandmother was talking?,4,2025-05-01 15:17:09,36,"I (25F) and my grandmother (69F) always have something to bicker about but I just want to take this one to the public eye to see if I'm insane and actually just really bad at social cues. I am on the spectrum for context.

She was ranting about my uncle visiting us with his wife and how she wants me to talk it out with them so they don't visit because she doesn't like doing that part. I was in the kitchen making breakfast, entirely out of her sight.

I made cereal and was just listening to her rant. When I finished making the cereal, I took the bowl and walked to the back of the house to my bedroom door and leaned in the doorway to listen to her talk.

When she finished, without giving me time to respond, asked ""Are you even listening or did you just walk away?"". I stated ""I'm standing in my bedroom doorway but I heard everything,"" and even repeated back her last 2 sentences.

She scoffed, stated I was just rude and did walk away as she suspected, and has been cold ever since. So Reddit, I give you the stage. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for asking my mum to research which school my brother should go to?,18,2025-05-01 07:52:25,27,"My brother (11) is going into secondary school next year, so we need to fill out a form and preferences for which school we want him to be placed at. My mum (53) doesn't speak English, so naturally I (17) have to fill out the form. I ask her what to write and she tells me she didn't realise you could put preferences. So I ask her to think about it and we could maybe finish filling it out in a few days after we've all had a think, as I feel it's important for his future and we don't want to mess this up, especially since we have messed up once before with an opportunity for him to go to a private school (keep this in mind).

A few minutes later she tells me which schools she wants to put, and I ask her if we wanted to consult my brother or dad, since I don't know if we've discussed it properly. Also, we've been telling my brother he's going to go to our neighbourhood school, but he really doesn't like change (he's autistic) so I thought we should get his opinion as well. Of course, she says no. Then I ask if she can look online to double check and make sure she knows which schools she's talking about, and she starts getting defensive, saying she's 100% sure about which ones and that I just need to write them down on the form.

I was getting a bit frustrated, because this is kind of a big decision and she has a history of getting names wrong, so I push a little harder for us to look into it a bit more. She starts yelling that I'm insulting her, that I'm implying she's incompetent, that I don't trust her judgement and if she's 100% sure we shouldn't have to check. My logic is that even if I'm 100% sure about something I will still double check, since obviously I can be wrong even if I think I'm right because that's how it works. So I try and explain this to her, but she isn't having any of it, and just re-emphasises how I'm being rude and how I'm saying she doesn't know what she's talking about. 

Basically what happened after that was I also started yelling so she could even hear me, defending myself saying I am not trying to insult her, I don't understand why she is so against doing a little bit more research, and I accused her of being lazy and just not wanting to look something up. She was yelling about how I'm trying to stir shit because I wanted to consult the others, I'm looking for a bone to pick, she's busy making dinner so she can't research, she thinks my father messed up the previously mentioned private school opportunity on purpose and I need to shut up and stop questioning her because I'm pissing her off.

After a few more minutes of yelling from both of us I eventually gave up. Should I have not pushed so much? Should I have just filled in the form like she said and been done with it?"
amitheasshole,AITAH for saying no to my dad vs my autistic son's needs?,119,2025-04-30 21:51:42,63,"Context:
Everyone involved lives on the same property‚Äîme, my wife, our kids, my parents, my sister, and her toddler. My wife and I pay rent and cover our own utilities.

Messages between us in the family's messenger group chat:

Dad(out of the blue, no previous warning or anything about this happening): 
""I've got 2 yards of dirt in the back of my truck for gardening it's about 3,000 lb or more so hopefully there's somebody who wants to help me shovel some dirt tonight""

Me:
""[Wife] is taking [Son] to Urban Air after school and I am home alone with [Son], so hopefully [Sister] can help?""

Dad:
""You and [Son] come out and help, we‚Äôll just give the little shovel and a bucket and let him move dirt too. He might enjoy it. He might even be able to help Nana plant a couple of things, strawberries or tomatoes or something. This is all assuming we don‚Äôt get rained out and I just have to park the truck inside the shop until tomorrow.""

Me:
""He‚Äôs gonna run away. I‚Äôm not really okay with that as a solution. Can‚Äôt [Sister] help? 

""I'd be happy to help when I can plan it out better or have [Wife] here, but this is last minute and butts against our plans and his current capabilities. I need more advanced notice for things like this, I'm not trying to be difficult, but I have a child with special needs and I have an obligation to put those concerns first.""


---

The more explained version of the problem:

My dad has a pattern of doing this: he‚Äôll announce that ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù needs to help with a physical task‚Äîusually with short notice‚Äîand more often than not, the unspoken expectation is that either my wife or I will drop what we‚Äôre doing and take care of it.

This time it‚Äôs moving 3,000 lbs of dirt out of his truck, but in the past it‚Äôs been things like patching the roof, manning the burn pile, or helping with cars. Nothing that requires expertise, but it eats up time we didn‚Äôt plan to give up.

The issue is that this often conflicts with our responsibilities and schedule, especially when I‚Äôm solo parenting our son who has autism and a high elopement risk. Our yard isn‚Äôt fenced, and earlier this year he ran off‚Äîwe had to call 911. Thankfully we found him before emergency services arrived. So I‚Äôm not okay leaving him less than 100% supervised just because someone else decided last-minute help was needed.

It‚Äôs been a bit now with no response to my last text‚Ä¶"
amitheasshole,AITA for requesting a different academic advisor?,2,2025-05-01 19:59:39,12,"Sorry if this is messy. Basically, I had an academic advising appointment at college to talk about my major. I said I struggle with classes but I explicitly stated I know the resources for the university I atrend. I told her this multiple times and she still kept talking about them.
I told her I just wanted to get my schedule worked out. I was informal, I openly admit that. I was upset, that doesn't excuse it. She told me I was being unprofessional and I hurt her feelings. She told me because I wanted to move past reasources I was preventing her from doing her job. I told her I knew about the reasources multiple times and I just wanted to talk about scheduling. She kept telling me I was disrespectful and kept ignoring what I asked. It felt like she thought I was a child or an idiot. I gave up after a few minutes and just left.
Immediately after, I requested a new advisor. I'm scared I over reacted and was a huge dick for no reason. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to do a DNA test to confirm if my father is the father of another child?,3557,2025-04-30 03:32:36,1037,"For context, about 5 years ago, my mom came across a message from a woman claiming my father is the baby daddy to her 3 year old daughter, and compared photos of her and I when I was around that age to show that ‚Äúwe looked alike‚Äù, however dismissed getting any DNA tests after my father got incarcerated.  Now I, 17F, and my mom recently came across a message tonight from the same woman again claiming my father is the baby daddy to her now 8 year old daughter. Now that her daughter is older, she has started questioning who her real father is. 

Now, this is the part that has me a bit skeptical:
Her daughter DOES has the same skin color as my dad, however every other feature is completely different. My dad has hazel almost vibrant green eyes, while the mother has bright blue. My mother ALSO has bright blue eyes, and my mother and father‚Äôs genes resulted in central heterochromia in my eyes. This child has pitch black eyes. Usually brown eyes are the dominant gene to blue eyes, so how did pitch black eyes suddenly appear on my dad‚Äôs side of the family? (their eyes are all very vibrant green or grey) 
Not only do the eyes get me, but the nose shape on both my dad and I‚Äôs are the same, however this woman‚Äôs daughter has a completely different nose shape.

This lady is basically convinced that my father is her baby daddy, and even said tonight if my father wasn‚Äôt willing to give a DNA test, asked if I would be willing to give a DNA test, yet has not even told us her name. I‚Äôm torn in between a decision but my father is actively in my life and I know that if he KNEW he had another child, he would also try to be in this child‚Äôs life. Only thing is, she lives 2 states away. Getting a DNA test done would do what, get child support? She‚Äôs financially stable with a husband and 2 other kids, so why now is she reaching out after 5 years? Reassurance is real and I 100% support it, however in that big time gap, what was the mother telling her daughter?

With all of that in consideration, I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable giving a DNA sample. She told my mother that we‚Äôre ruining her daughter‚Äôs life by not allowing her to know her real father, however I just can‚Äôt believe her as if this was my father‚Äôs child, why didn‚Äôt she reach out sooner?

I‚Äôm not sure anymore, I just feel like an ass, but my gut just tells me something fishy is going on. So, AITA? :/

UPDATE:
okay so wow, didn‚Äôt think this was going to get as much attention as it did, but thank you guys for your personal opinions and also informing me of my misuse of information. i‚Äôve talked to to my dad, he is aware that this woman has reached out again, my mom told him this morning and showed screenshots of the woman‚Äôs messages. he‚Äôs going to get the DNA test done and out of the way, but is also a bit skeptical because she hasn‚Äôt perused anything legally for the past 5 years. i‚Äôve spoken to some of my personal friends and family about what i should be doing, and it just hurts me that if this is my half sister, i haven‚Äôt been allowed to be involved with her. i‚Äôm going to talk more with my dad when he gets off work, but the next update will be the DNA test results, i‚Äôm just not sure how long that will take.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling an elderly neighbor not to wake me up for basic smartphone interaction help?,1842,2025-04-30 06:55:02,152,"Sooo let me preface this a bit: 


I live in an apartment complex and my next door neighbor is an elderly and frankly frail guy, hes close to 80 years old and his health is mediocre at best, hes exhibiting symptoms of parkinsons disease and has a slurred speech which makes me feel bad for him.


Im in my 20s and I work from home but due to the nature of my job, my work takes place in what you would call a graveyard shift, usually 1-2AM to 7-8AM so I am nocturnal and end up sleeping throughout the day until evening. 


This is where the problem began, my neighbor has a basic smartphone with written directions on how to use it, mostly for calls through WhatsApp and from what I've seen, he has remembered a pattern on how to enter the application and make a call, he once rang my doorbell and asked for help since his ""phone stopped working"", ended up restarting it for him and all was good. That was about 2 months ago and since then he ended up ringing the doorbell a few times which obviously wakes me up and interrupts my sleep (I am a light sleeper), all the times it was like ""can you remove this message for me"" or ""phone isn't working"" which usually requires a reboot. I told him politely that if its not urgent not to wake me up since im nocturnal due to my job and after that he was respectful for a week and then a few days ago he rang the doorbell two days in a row during daytime because ""his application doesn't look the same"" and the ""call button is not where it should be, fix it please"". I did fix it for him but on the second day I was pissed off that he woke me up for a trivial thing and **without yelling or raising my voice** told him ""please dude, for fucks sake if its not something urgent do not ring the doorbell and wake me up, i get up at 7-8PM and i'll help you with anything but please if there is no need do not ring the damn doorbell"", he apologized and went on his way.


Well this morning he ambushed me as I was leaving my apartment and asked me to ""delete myself from his contacts"" so he doesn't have to ""upset or disturb"" me again (I gave him my number some time ago) and that he ""doesn't want to piss me off"" , he did it in a regretful fashion I feel like I am getting guilt tripped? Or did I really act like an asshole and should apologize to the old guy?"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking for attention from my husband?,1,2025-05-01 22:49:14,2,"My husband has been taking on a lot of work lately. The last time we were intimate was on my birthday. Now it's been 11 months. He keeps taking all this extra work, and when I ask for even something, it's always turned into an argument. He doesn't have time to give me a quick peck on the cheek, but always has time to argue with me about me wanting attention. He said I was selfish and self-absorbed, and I'm acting entitled and that nothing he does for me is enough. I don't think I am, but maybe I'm denying it. I don't think I ask for a lot of attention, just some cuddles or something. Me and him feel jerking off is basically cheating(it's a personal thing we agreed on years ago), so I can't even jerk off to stop being pent up. I'm not asking for him to rail me or stroke my (insert item of male anatomy) or anything, just some cuddles or a kiss. Am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for calling out my family‚Äôs neo nazi ties?,0,2025-05-01 22:44:22,3,"To pretext this, I (27/m) am a mixed Native American that was adopted into my stepfathers family after my mothers death. They are all white. I also have a younger sister (23), who is biologically related to my stepfather. She now has a two year old child. That situation is complex but that‚Äôs the gist of it.

For the past few years, my uncle has been saying very racist things around me, such as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre Indian, but you‚Äôre white so it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù ‚ÄúIndians are always drunks‚Äù ‚ÄúIndians always complain so much, the Irish had it worse‚Äù etc. I‚Äôve always tried to explain it away or ignore it to keep the peace, because I knew if I ever said anything it would just start an argument.

However this eventually came to a head when I found out they invited a neo-nazi to our family‚Äôs Thanksgiving this year. At the time, I had no idea who the guy was. It was him and his wife. It wasn‚Äôt until February when I discovered the man on Facebook by complete chance that I found out he was very clearly a neo-nazi. (S.S. Lightning bolts everywhere, memorabilia from known white supremacists, etc.)

When I discovered this, I messaged my aunt with the hope that they didn‚Äôt know, and to warn them. I told her I didn‚Äôt want this to turn into an argument. I told her and showed all of the evidence, and she completely blew me off and didn‚Äôt take anything I said seriously. She then lied to me and said they hadn‚Äôt talked to them since Thanksgiving, even though she was actively promoting their business (they own a massage parlor) less than two weeks before I messaged her

When I asked her if they owned the massage parlor she was promoting, she said something along the lines of ‚Äúyeah, she gives great massages, you should get one sometime.‚Äù After this, I was frustrated and basically told her I know I can‚Äôt change their perspective overnight, and that I still love them.

2 days later, I went on her Facebook to find that she was still friends with these people, and had made a post on her Facebook saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt push your beliefs on others‚Äù post with an emoji of a woman holding her hand flat in the air. This made me so angry that I immediately blocked them, and haven‚Äôt spoken to them since.

Since then, half of my adopted family have completely cut contact with me, including my sister, who is now living with them even though I told her everything.

Did I overreact as they are saying?

Over time, though, the friendship became painful in small ways. I‚Äôd express feelings and feel dismissed. She didn‚Äôt make me feel safe being vulnerable, even though I really loved her and wanted the bond to stay.

I never tried to hurt her, but one time I suggested she consider therapy not out of judgment, but as support. She later told me that deeply offended her, like I was calling her broken. That was never my intention.
Eventually, after so much quiet hurt, she did one last thing that broke my patience. I exploded. I said things that hurt her deeply. I won‚Äôt excuse it, I lashed out. Then she blocked me everywhere and we never spoke ever since, but we see each other in school. 

So after 11 months of no contact, I reached out to apologize and try to reconnect. She asked for space and time to think, so I respected that and waited. We were in the same classroom during our senior year, and for six months, I didn‚Äôt follow up or push. I had no other close friendships at that point and spent that year mostly silent. Near graduation, she gave her answer  she didn‚Äôt want to reconnect. After waiting all that time, it ended like that. I gave up a lot during those six months. "

They are now official as well. The things that made me feel not  supportive of is

that a little before they became official she ghosted us.( her family) no text messages no hang outs anymore.. also this guy barely got out of a relationship 5 months ago. Which according to him he was cheated on and the relationship was about 2-3 years long.. my sister Also has been staying over at his house almost everyday‚Ä¶she‚Äôs also made a comment to me that she would like to plan us to get pregnant together so are kids can grow up close in age ..

Which I know my sister wants to find someone and start a life with them ‚Ä¶ but I feel like she‚Äôs rushing things because I‚Äôm in a relationship and have a kid and so does one of our brother (22M) .. so I feel like she just feels left out or something.  Also maybe 2-3 years ago she did the same thing ‚Ä¶ she talked to this guy that she barely talked to and they became official and she thought she was in love but the whole relationship was toxic ‚Ä¶ took her about a year to finally end it completely. But back to her current new relationship I also feel like him having his own house has a lot to do with her wanting to rush it. Apparently he wants her to move in around August/September ‚Ä¶

Point is I just worry that she‚Äôs rushing this whole thing . I‚Äôm nervous he won‚Äôt be the guy she thinks he is and it‚Äôll be another cycle she created .. I voiced this to her and so did my sister in law that she hasn‚Äôt been around lately (that we hardly see her anymore) and she thinks we aren‚Äôt supportive and mad that she‚Äôs in a relationship.. which isn‚Äôt the case.. I also asked her if she can watch my baby while me and my husband can go on a date and she wanted to bring her new boyfriend to my house while she watches my baby..I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that and I think that made her upset with me and now I feel  she started distancing herself from us (her family) and told me if I wanted to see her I needed to invite  her and her new bf because he is a part of her now and she‚Äôs in love with him ..

amitheasshole,AITA for saying my boyfriend was responsible for our flooding,35,2025-05-01 03:29:59,68,"English is not my first language so I apologize in advance. I (30F) and my boyfriend (35M) got woken up today by angry knocks on the door. We went out for drinks tonight.

As soon as I stepped out of bed I knew something was wrong. All our floor was completely wet. I heard water running and I saw our washbasin was running and leaking at a really fast speed. I closed it and opened the door. The downstairs neighbor and like 5 firemen where there because water was leaking downstairs. I apologized and said that the tap of the washbasin had caused it and said maybe our dog opened it during the night. They took my information and my insurance data and left. Apparently two floors downstairs were affected and they had shut down the entire water from all the building because they didn‚Äôt know were it was coming from. I cleaned everything and I‚Äôm contacting the insurance tomorrow to help my neighbors.

Meanwhile my boyfriend was still drunk and naked so I told him to wait on the bedroom. After they left he cleaned with me but was super angry I blamed him for the running tap (when the firemen entered I went to the bedroom and explained what was going on and I said upset ‚Äúyou left the tap running‚Äù). I didn‚Äôt see if he did it (I was also drunk when we got home and went to sleep) but the tap is in his bathroom and I never go to his bathroom and our dog has never done something like this since he was a puppy (but something similar happened years before because of him).

I apologized as I really don‚Äôt know what happened but he‚Äôs super upset and saying that we should tackle it as a team. I understand but I just said it once while trying to figure out what happened and  didn‚Äôt say it again as I do think it‚Äôs not fair, but I‚Äôm so angry he‚Äôs just focusing in that instead of resolving everything. He says he thinks he did it but is very angry I blamed him. He helped clean but now I have to deal with everything while he‚Äôs just upset saying I messed up.

I‚Äôm so angry and frustrated because honestly I just want someone in my life that deals with whit with me instead of the whole blame game. We‚Äôve been talking about marriage and kids but this kinda makes me feel the ick. I‚Äôm really upset at him now, mostly because of course we can talk about his feelings but I think he‚Äôs overreacting and deflecting, even saying that I‚Äôm gaslighting him. AITA?

Tl;dr : tab was open and we caused damaged to down stairs neighbors. I blamed my boyfriend and he‚Äôs upset but I‚Äôm upset he‚Äôs just yelling at me and focusing on it instead of resolving it and then talking about his feelings more calmly. "

But today, when we talked, the person said the whole time, that they did not deserve to live and they think everyone hates them. And me, on the other hand, couldnt help them, because they just told themselves the same thing over and over again. I told them to go join a Discord server or call a hotline, where someone could properly help them.

Hindsight probably should of checked in with Erin before doing this but she would usually tell me if she wanted to keep leftovers. 

I get a text from Erin later on asking if I chucked the pancakes and I said I did. She then told me that they were going to be her boyfriends dinner. I said to her that she looked at me while I chucked them and she never told me to leave them. She then asked if she needed to tell me everything?

Okay, just got dropped off by my driving instructor. 30 minutes into our session and she went ahead and got me a different teacher, when I never asked for one.

Context:

From the moment I was in the car, she was all about business and getting things done. Not even a welcoming environment. But understandable, shes here to teach me to drive.

Before even any driving, tells me to correct myself. I do. Asks me if I‚Äôm okay, I tell her yes. Keeps telling me how to sit myself comfortably, I do what she says.
Driving, then boom
I make the slightest mistake with my hand position, she corrects me. Okay, normal.
Driving, driving, tells me to correct my stopping and hand signals, I do.

Continuing to talk to me throughout the lesson instead of letting me focus on the driving, and only speaking to me when needed.

My signals and turning are getting better by this point, though I am still tense because shes breathing down my neck. Again, she continues to ask if I‚Äôm okay. 

K turn time, she guides me through it, corrected me when needed, I‚Äôm stressing a little but stay quiet and make it through. 

Now she just kept staring at me and told me to ease myself and I do, then continues to ask if I‚Äôm okay. I say yes. 

Once again, micromanaging my every move and she won‚Äôt shut up for her fucking life and just let me drive. By this point I‚Äôm annoyed. And I get it this is her job, so I don‚Äôt say anything.

We do parallel turns, she walks me through it. I complete the turn. Corrected me when needed.

I ask her if she speaks tagalog, so its easier for me to understand (because her English wasn‚Äôt the best), she gets defensive saying ‚Äúno i teach all my students in english‚Äù, I tell her okay. Thats fine. 
Then for some reason, I didn‚Äôt even say anything bad, she says ‚Äúare you okay? Are you angry? Im a psychic and I can tell that something is off‚Äù.

I told her I was a little annoyed. I asked for her to be more patient and calmer with me instead of breathing down my neck. She kept interrupting me and saying this is how I need to teach you.

I asked her to just listen to my feelings and she kept saying this is how I always teach, I am teaching you

I tried speaking up saying can you be more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù and less ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù? And to teach me calmly? 

She insisted that she‚Äôs teaching me correctly, that I‚Äôm learning

I told her I‚Äôll learn better if she slows down a little bit and meet me in the middle, we‚Äôre both adults

She says how about you just get a new instructor?

I told her no, its fine.
And she insisted.

Dropped me off, silent car ride, now we‚Äôre here.

amitheasshole,AITA for talking to my MIL as if she were a child?,1,2025-05-01 21:34:08,7,"Context: my bf(John) and I(Jay) have been together for 4 years, knew each other for 5. The long distance only just began a year ago due to his job. We're both currently living with our parents and plan to move in together July.(3 hours away from each other) I met his mom a year after we were officially bf and gf. When I would visit she would pull me away from my bf to have long talks or go out. The talks started as cutesy stuff about my bf then turned into her venting about her grievances. Ever since last year September, she's been giving me backhanded remarks. She sent me a text while I was at work on Wednesday, telling me to call her which I genuinely forgot to do. We previously spoke otp for 3 hours (her ranting about how terrible of a son my bf was for talking to her as if she wasn't his mother.) Due to me not calling her, the next day she sent me this text: ""Good day Jay. Hope all is well . Since you chose not to call me. I am leaving this message and I hope you get it. If John is inviting you to come for the Easter I hope you decline his invitation. I am not going to be here, I don't like strangers in my house when I am not here I will ask our neighbor to show me her camera""

I replied: Hi, I'm sure you recall, but I don't believe in travelling during Easter so this message was unwarranted. I respect you enough to not show up at your home uninvited. I do hope assumptions like this aren't made in the future since you know I'm not the type to do that. I also don't consider myself a stranger and it saddens me that you think so. I hope you have a great Easter.

She then replied: ""It was warranted because I know my son. You might think you know him, but he is my son. And I definitely can make assumptions because like I said I know my son. he has proven to his family that you are more important than us. Which I pity. you are happy to know that John continue to have attitude towards me his mother But I checked and was told that he's been charmed. And tbh if I haven't accepted the relationship then you're a stranger. They say it's better to be truthful than be a hypocrite. Enjoy you Easter God bless. in the future have a little respect I am your senior. I just felt I was spoken to like a child.""

I couldn't see how I spoke to her like a child but replied in kind. ""But the thing is I already told you I wasn't planning to travel. And do you know your son? Wouldn't it be better to tell him not to invite me instead? And I really don't know what else you want me to do. I've spoken to him about his attitude to you  but its up to him to fix himself don't you think & Charmed? I think that's childish don't you? I respect your opinion of me, its fine but as they tell the kids, it's a two way street to respect."" She didn't respond but called instead. I didn't pick u, I told my bf and he was on my side.

amitheasshole,AITA for setting boundaries and telling my sister I‚Äôm done with her shit?,60,2025-04-30 22:56:49,44,"
So my sister (21f) lets call her Jane and I (27f) have never had a great relationship, I‚Äôll be honest. We‚Äôve never had much in common but we‚Äôve never been outright hostile with eachother, there was some shit when we were younger (typical sister stuff) but i feel like as adults we can move past that. 

Anyways I had a baby last year (1f) and Jane has been pretty okay for the most part, not super involved but no biggie. Then my other sister (25f) lets call her Molly, had a baby (6mo M) and Jane has gone out of her way to interact, play with and visit our nephew, and seems to go out of her way to avoid my daughter. Molly lives in a different town that we do, (Jane lives with our parents). When asked about it by our parents Janes response was ‚Äúwell thats just how it is‚Äù 

This isnt my first issue with her and my daughter. When we were first starting my daughter on solids, we were staying away from some foods because my husband has a pretty severe peanut allergy, i have a bunch of allergies and we were concerned that she might develop some because thats super common. I asked Jane not to feed my daughter a finger full of cool-whip and without breaking eye-contact she defied me. That led to a whole thing, but we had had a conversation and i thought we were over it. 

Over easter we had a family thing with my parents and siblings and i thought all was well, jane was fine, until she started doing the same stuff. My parents tried to intervene by putting my daughter in her vicinity so she would have to interact with her. But she still did the same stuff handed her off and then immediately asked for our nephew. Ignored her. Etc. shes been doing other passive aggressive shit to me but thats, yeah. Anyways. 

i sat on it for a few days and eventually decided to text her telling her that i‚Äôm just sad at how shes treating her and that i wont go out of my way to mend whatever this is. I don‚Äôt want my daughter growing up thinking that this treatment is normal or okay. 

Well she responded as if I‚Äôm the problem here, that I‚Äôm twisting reality and manipulating things. She feels like what shes been doing is not a problem and that i have unreasonable expectations and that of course she would have a different relationship with our nephew because she has a different relationship with Molly. And i think its bullshit. So AITA? 

TL;DR: my sister treats our nephew differently than she treats my daughter and i told her off, now she says I‚Äôm the one in the wrong. 

INFO: 
Jane and I had a conversation after the food incident where we decided that if we had an issue with eachother we would talk it out and figure it out. She says she has an issue with me because she feels my husband and I get preferential treatment from our parents based on how much work we do around the farm, we dont live there and do as much as we can, she does live there, doesnt pay rent, gas, phone utilities etc. 

The passive aggressive shit she has been doing is ignoring me at family gatherings, stopping a conversation when i walk in the room, or like there was a whole thing with our birthdays this year where when i texted her for her birthday she didn‚Äôt reply to me. "

amitheasshole,AITAH for wanting my cousin to leave after she‚Äôs been living with us for years without contributing?,386,2025-04-30 13:04:58,71,"My maternal cousin moved in with us along with her two kids. She was going through a tough time, her husband wasn‚Äôt supporting her, and she didn‚Äôt have a job. Out of kindness, my parents let her stay temporarily.

I was against it from day one because we‚Äôve been through something like this before. Another set of relatives moved in ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù and ended up staying for 7 years. It was extremely stressful getting them to finally leave. I didn‚Äôt want a repeat.

 
This cousin doesn‚Äôt pay rent (her husband still sends no money). She says she can‚Äôt work because she can't read or write but whenever we find a job for her where reading or writing is not required suddenly she feels unwell. We agreed to help her for a while, not forever. But now it‚Äôs been years, and she shows no signs of leaving.


My mom tried having a gentle talk with her. The cousin said, ‚ÄúMy kids cry when I mention moving‚Äù. And being in an asian household kicking her out outright isn‚Äôt an option. Say one thing and she starts crying or completely ignores us, refusing to talk with us which emotionally drains my mom.

I once told my mom to stop comforting her and give her some space. When my mom did, the cousin started guilt-tripping us, talking to herself in ways meant for us to hear, like:

"" arrogant rich people, they treat poor people differently""  

We are not rich.

"" just because I am poor they are treating me like this"" 

"" I will cook my own food""

"" I will leave this place where no respect is there for us""

I snapped and told her maybe that's a good idea. My mom gave me the mom glare but gave my cousin a separate kitchen space anyway. She didn‚Äôt even last a month before coming back to ask if we could all eat together again.

I hold nothing against her kids, they‚Äôre innocent. But I can‚Äôt fake being okay seeing their mom manipulate and freeload every day. She and I avoid each other now, which honestly works for me. I just want her to move out, but I‚Äôm also wondering, AITAH for wanting this? Am I being too cold, mean, or overreacting?


****EDIT****

I realize now I should have added more detail, sorry about that. I thought it would be too long if I included everything. I was just feeling overwhelmed by my family's situation and how my loved ones are stuck in it. I‚Äôve tried my best to explain things now.

I‚Äôm 20 years old. My cousin is 27, her son is 12, and her daughter is 5. Shortly after our other relatives moved out, she came to stay with us while pregnant with her daughter. Her husband hasn‚Äôt visited even once since she moved in. She told us she left her in-laws because she was mistreated, and we believed her at the time. But much later, we found out the real reason, she just didn‚Äôt want to do the household work expected from DIL in our culture. Before moving in with us, she had actually been staying with some distant relatives in another city, but we didn‚Äôt know that until much later either.

 We live in a rented apartment far from our hometown, this is the only apartment we can afford under our budget and we moved here for my siblings‚Äô education. I work in a small company here to help support my family.

We did reach out to her parents for support, but they refused. They live in a rural village and  are completely dependent on farming and livestock, and don‚Äôt have a stable income. Her father is also very traditional and believes that once a daughter is married, she shouldn‚Äôt come back to live at her parents‚Äô house.

She dropped out of school as a child after constantly hiding or running away to avoid going to school, and her parents eventually gave up. Years later, she ran off and married her current husband, which only added to her father‚Äôs anger.

 Even though my mother never had formal education either, my mom taught herself to read and write with our help and now earns by packing goods for local shops. She even referred my cousin for the same type of job, which requires little to no literacy but my cousin gave excuse after excuse. 

I offered to teach her years ago, but she said she‚Äôd rather work on farms than study. 
Now, I see her children following her path, her son plays online games day and night, and she and her daughter spend the whole day making short videos and reels. I worry about her children but It‚Äôs not really my responsibility to intervene in how they‚Äôre raised.

She doesn‚Äôt receive child support because she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the legal process, yet she wants to put her kids in one of the most expensive schools in town, which we simply can‚Äôt afford. 

She also likes to spend money. She spends every penny she gets,  saying, ‚ÄúYou never know how long you live.‚Äù My parents couldn‚Äôt keep up with her spending habits and eventually refused to give her money. She got offended. Not long after that, 55k cash of my parents‚Äô money went missing. We suspect it was her, but there was no proof, so my parents let it go. Since then, my mom started hiding her keys in a place only our immediate family knows.

My mom tried speaking to her gently about getting a job and moving out, and we all know how that ended. 

Yes, I believe I should leave that decision to my parents  unless it starts interfering with my siblings‚Äô studies and our future.

Yes, I could move out and support myself but if I didn‚Äôt care deeply about my family, I would have already done that.

 If I leave, my parents‚Äô limited income and their years of savings will dry up just trying to feed and taking care of everyone. There‚Äôll be nothing left for their old age. And my siblings are still too young to help them."

The going cost of a room in a house in the area is anywhere from ¬£400-800 per month, and a 1 bed flat can go anywhere from ¬£500-1500 per month in the area.

My sister has offered me ¬£600 per month with bills included (not food). I was under the impression when initially offered the room many years ago that it would just be the cost of bills to have me there (+ a little extra). I am now feeling a bit uncomfortable as I feel that she is profiting from me. I know the rate is still good in comparison to the area but it just feels odd to me

amitheasshole,AITA for controlling parent blowup or is it more nuanced?,2,2025-05-01 16:53:30,9,"My mom and I have always had a rocky relationship, and no I haven‚Äôt always been the best kid, I just really need to know a verdict here so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. 

I‚Äôm an adult and recently graduated from college. Admittedly, I‚Äôve been a bit lazy. I still help out around the house, have set chores I do while I jobhunt and yes, do other things like reading and playing games through the day. I HAVE been lazy lately, but I was more or less justifying it as having a bit of a break before I start working again. There was no real inclination my mom was upset at me over not helping enough before today, and I was blindsided by the blowup she had today. She works from home, and had boiled eggs this morning and told me I could have one of I wanted. After she makes boiled eggs she usually puts them in the fridge with the shells on, so I didn‚Äôt peel the rest. 

She blows up at me, telling me I‚Äôm lazy, that I‚Äôm a terrible child, that I never help out without being asked (which I will say isn‚Äôt true, I do chores I haven‚Äôt been asked to do often), and I‚Äôve learned to keep my head down and take the yelling. I don‚Äôt know how long she yelled at me but it was around 30 minutes. She ends it by telling me to go up to my room because looking at me makes her sick, and that really hurt my feelings. I do think I‚Äôm the asshole here partially, but I also feel like my mom is being unfair. If I do things without her asking, she gets mad at me for doing things wrong, if I don‚Äôt do those things, she gets mad at me for not doing them, if I ask how to do them, she gets mad at me for asking. I just don‚Äôt really know how to be better.

So AITA? Are we both? "
amitheasshole,WIBTA for calling out my coworker for calling out of work?,1,2025-05-01 20:22:02,32,"My coworker just got engaged yesterday evening. They texted me this morning saying they were calling out for the day so they could spend more time with their now-fianc√©. Of note, they live together and have weekends off together as well. 

While I am genuinely thrilled for them, their calling out left me in a shit position. We are short staffed in a medical care setting where I am also training 2 new hires, and so I had to additionally cover their work for the day. I do a lot for our specific service line at work and often end up picking up extra work, so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being overly sensitive about this or unreasonable for being annoyed/upset.

WIBTAH if I shared my feelings on how I felt this scenario was inappropriate and unprofessional? I just don‚Äôt want this kind of thing to be accepted or come up more in the future. Or should I just let it go without saying anything?

amitheasshole,AITA 35F if I have a conversation with my MIL 53F about this?,39,2025-05-01 00:13:20,402,"AITA if I have a conversation with my MIL about this?

I‚Äôm a 35F and my husband we will call him Will is a 35M and we have a 3 year old little girl our daughter that we will call Stella. We been married 10 years. I feel like my MIL doesn‚Äôt like me and continually treats me and my husband not like a married unit but rather consistently treats my husband great and me like I‚Äôm a not a member of the family. My thoughts are if she couldn‚Äôt afford it she could have been a bit more inclusive and said, ‚Äúhey I‚Äôll give you guys such and such amount towards the vacation but the rest is on you guys.‚Äù Instead of being like I‚Äôll pay for you but not her. It‚Äôs not a very nice or good feeling to feel like you are treated like the random person your son is married to and that‚Äôs how I feel I‚Äôm treated rather than a DIL.

For example I get completely ignored by my MIL on Mother‚Äôs Day and my MIL makes a huge deal of my husband on Father‚Äôs Day. Recently my MIL wanted to plan a family vacation with my FIL, SIL, husband, myself, and our daughter.    She told my husband she would pay for his portion but I had to pay for myself. The combination of her ignoring me on Mother‚Äôs Day, my birthday as well, and now not paying for us together as a married couple I can‚Äôt help but feel she treats me like an outsider and deep down hates me. 

I feel like when you are married you don‚Äôt separate out the two for occasions like a paid vacation you either pay for both as a couple or no one. To me that‚Äôs the equivalent of us both being invited to dinner by my MIL and then her only paying for my husband and then saying, ‚Äúoh you have to pay for yourself.‚Äù It‚Äôs just plain hurtful. 

AITA if I have a conversation with my MIL about this. The vacation thing really hurt my feelings.
I could be the AH for putting my MIL on the spot."
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I told my dad how I really felt?,48,2025-04-30 23:02:07,23,"I (17f) lost my mom to cancer in February. This loss has been so hard on me. She didn't give birth to me, but she has been my mom for almost 11 years. When my dad got custody of me, they started dating. I was around four, but that didn't scare her off. She could have left when she found out that he had a kid, but she didn't. She chose to stay, she chose me. I think that might be why it's been so much harder on me than other deaths in the family. She had been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer back in September, and in February things got worse. She started rapidly declining, and was eventually practically catatonic in a hospital bed. She was like that for a week, and each day I was by her side. I was there with her when she passed, and it's something that's haunted me. I can't get that memory out of my mind. The death was really hard on my dad, too. The whole time she was dying, my dad promised not to move on. It may have been grief saying that, and I know he really meant it. However, at the end of March he set up a tinder profile. I didn't know this until he called me one day, and telling me he invited his tinder date over to stay the night. This really pissed me off, but I didn't say anything. I stayed in my bed that night and got high while I cried. I wasnt comfortable with the fact that some random woman was in my house not even two months after my mom died. It pissed me off that he didn't ask me or my sister (10) if she could come over. I was so devastated, and it felt like he was trying to replace my mom. This happened two more times, but those times he made me and my sister leave for the weekend. It started to feel like he didn't want us around and was paying more attention to these women than to us. Eventually, he found someone he connected with and they went on a few dates. He came home and told us that she was coming over and that we needed to find somewhere to stay. His exact words to me were ""I don't care what you do or who you're with as long as your not home."" And that hurt me so much. It felt like he just didn't care about me. Eventually I decided to try and talk to him about what I'd been feeling, and he exploded. He starting screaming that he was a terrible father, and that he just couldn't do anything right. This ended the conversation right then and there so I went to my room. He eventually came and apologized for yelling, and told me that this new womans biggest fear was me and my sister not accepting it and not being ready for my dad to move on. Which is the truth. I'm not. I guess to me it's just so hard seeing him like this. Like he's forgetting all about my mom. It makes me feel like I should be moved on too, when Im not and I don't know if I ever will be. I'm afraid that if I talked to him about it, he'd explode again. And it would make me feel bad because I just want him happy, but it still really hurts. So, WIBTA if I told him my feelings?"

throwaway acc cuz i dont wanna post this on my main
so my(15f) mom(37 i think??f) has been bugging me almost all weke cuz she ""needs"" to use my paypal (which i shouldn't even have at my age, but i use it for art comms and also shut up (/lh)) cuz she aparently NEEDS to buy a shirt from a tiktok friend(we'll call her Flower)

mom is a mod in Flower's tiktok lives (i think that's how that works?) and theyre online friends off tt as well
Flower is american and we are canadiam 

so my mom came to mr knowing that i have paypal and Flower's payment nethod for the shirts is pypal and my mom doesn't have paypal/can't get hers to work so shes been bugging me nonstop and just being really reLly mean because i said ""no""

she says im being selfish (bro how ur the one getting pissy at ur kid cuz they said no to you using their paypal..;-;) and rude and she just needs me to do this one simple thing for her and ""i do so much for you and you can't even do yhis for me""?? 

its a shirt??

i'm also literally negative on paypal by like 30$ because of a double charge and it wont refund me but she doesn't care and is saying im making it up eventhoufh i've shown her my screen n whatever
shes also just being extremely vague so like why would i do all ts when i dont even know wtf im actually paying for

so aitah?

will update if i get more info 

my fucking keyboard kepslaggig and not mputtng the keys im typing wha the uck im gonna twea out

EDIT: just got some more information from her that I pretty much had to go on a full ass mission and several side quests to get; flower had already sent her the shirt, she just needs to pay for it, SHE DOESN'T WANT MY INFO, but she wants to send money to me that I then transfer to my PayPal and then transfer to flower, which means she would have to send me almost double the amount of money so I can afford it because I'm in the negative (which would mean she would have to send me almost $60 and we can't afford that). I keep telling her that it would be a lot easier if she just does it herself and makes her own PayPal, I don't understand why she won't/can't

Ever since our friend has been with her new BF she's been smoking weed fairly regularly, so she asked if my fianc√©e who doesn't smoke would take the drug test for her. My fianc√©e asked me my thoughts about it, I told her I don't think she should, she asked me why and I told her that it's dishonest, enabling of inappropriate behavior and could get her in trouble. She agreed with my point of view and told our friend that she wouldn't do it. I thought that was the end of it but I was unfortunately wrong. I woke up to several messages from our friend and her boyfriend telling me I'm an asshole for telling my fianc√©e not to help her and potentially ruining her chance of getting the job and it honestly made me feel like im not a good friend. For added context, I'm not against smoking or people who do and my fianc√©e is on my side. So reddit AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for standing up for myself and asking for the child support my dad legally owes me during my last 3 months of university?,42,2025-04-30 21:55:04,8,"Hi Reddit,
I‚Äôm from Europe, so the laws might differ a bit, but I‚Äôll try to explain clearly.

I‚Äôm 24 and a university student. I haven‚Äôt had contact with my birth mom since I was a child. I lived with my dad and stepmom from age 8. Things got worse when I became a teen‚Äîmy stepmom often put me down, and my dad never defended me. When I graduated, I got told: ‚ÄúSo what? You won‚Äôt earn money with that.‚Äù

When COVID hit, I had just started university and my mental health worsened. My doctor suggested taking a semester off and living with my grandma. When I told my parents, they blew up. My stepmom yelled, tried to take my car keys, and my dad did nothing. I fled and eventually moved in with my grandma and started therapy.

They continued treating me badly, even throwing away all the furniture from my old room (which I had paid for) and replacing it without asking. Eventually, after a year off, I returned to university. I got financial aid from the state and knew I couldn‚Äôt live with my parents again, so I moved into my own apartment.

Here‚Äôs the legal situation:
In my country, parents of students under 25 receive ‚Ç¨250/month from the state, which must be passed to the child if they live elsewhere. My dad is also legally required to pay ~‚Ç¨170/month in child support. For a while, he did‚Äîeven ‚Ç¨70 extra.

But this year, the state asked him to pay back ‚Ç¨2.5k from the time I lived with my grandma. He never gave us the money back then‚Äîhe spent it on luxury stuff. Now, I moved back in with my grandma to save money (didn‚Äôt tell him at first because I feared he‚Äôd stop paying).

He eventually found out. This month, he only sent the state money, not the child support. I asked about it and he started a fight, saying I don‚Äôt pay rent and could‚Äôve ‚Äútalked openly‚Äù‚Äîwhich I never could because he always escalates, especially with my stepmom around.

I reminded him that my grandma‚Äôs retired and struggling. He also claimed he only got half the state money (because they‚Äôre withholding ‚Ç¨2.5k he refuses to repay). After some back and forth, he sent the money.

The next day, I was removed from the family group chat by my stepsister. Clearly, they talked about it and sided with him. They‚Äôre in their 30s and don‚Äôt understand my situation.

My dad has always had financial problems and took over ‚Ç¨100k from my grandparents. They helped him endlessly. They gave up insurance policies and dipped into retirement savings to help him.In return he rarely visits and even sold my aunt‚Äôs stuff without asking. When my grandfather had cancer, he promised to visit ‚Äúnext week‚Äù but never did. He passed away asking for him.

I‚Äôve always stayed calm and avoided conflict. But now, in my final months of university, I finally stood up for myself.

AITA for doing so?"
amitheasshole,AITA: for not asking my sister if it was ok if my son stayed with her when school got canceled?,0,2025-05-01 18:11:55,41,"AITA: 
On my phone sorry for mistakes.
I (43f) live with my sister (41f). I have a son (15m) who is autistic and has adhd. He goes to a technical school in the morning and regular school in the afternoon. Both schools lost power and were on a remote day. However afternoon school canceled before morning school and we made plans for my sister to take him and pick him up from morning school.

A few hours later morning school also closed. I let her know morning school has gone remote. So she knew he was going to be home from both now. I work mornings and she works from home.

 I went to work like normal and got a text around 8 am asking me when I was going to let her know my son was at home. I figured (assumed) I didn't need to let her know he was there because we knew both schools were remote. She was upset because I didn't tell her but I didn't feel like I needed to because we discussed it the night before. 

But AITA because I didn't ask if it was ok for him to be home?

Eta: she didn't care he was there, just wanted to know that he was there. He's also HF autism, he needs help making food."
amitheasshole,AITAH for taking control of my my parents money?,403,2025-04-30 09:31:20,45,"I spent few years of my life in a remote village as a joint family of 18 members. When my father and his two brothers got their first jobs abroad, except one. All the members became dependent on the three earning brothers. The one who stayed behind took on the role of head of the family and started managing (or rather hiding) the salaries sent by the others. Over time, my father‚Äôs brothers learned to protect their income and later took their wife and children with them, but my father didn‚Äôt. He sent his entire salary home out of respect for his brother, since our  grandfather died young and they‚Äôd grown up without a father, facing many hardships together. 

That uncle never gave my mother any money but lied in letters to my father (we didn‚Äôt have phones back then) saying he did give money to my mother. One day, my father found out through others that my uncle hadn‚Äôt given my mother money for my medicine, and I nearly d*ed. That was the breaking point, my father took us with him abroad.

Soon my parents forgot and forgave him.

Later that same uncle emotionally blackmailed, manipulated, my father into handing over our father's land, promising to return it after some "" family work"" which never happened. My father even took a loan for uncle, which they refused to repay, leaving him to carry the burden alone. You might wonder why he didn‚Äôt sue them?
Suing family members back then  just wasn‚Äôt something people did and never done till now.

We‚Äôre in a better place now. 
I now manage my parents finances. When my parents need large sums of money, they must explain why because we‚Äôve seen how being too generous backfires. Once my mother gave money to her side of the family and they refused to pay it back. Another time, my father helped his sisters and the same thing happened. It took a lot of effort and stress to recover it. So now, when relatives come asking for financial help, we‚Äôve told our parents to direct them to us, me and my brother. 

I ask questions like, for how long they'll need money ? i ask them to offer something valuable as collateral because if they can‚Äôt pay, we‚Äôll need something to cover the loss. If they refuse, I refuse too. They absolutely hate me for it. They see me as someone who‚Äôs acting selfishly by blocking help that used to be freely given. Some relatives call me mean, controlling, cold, heartless, and rude. My parents worry that my actions might create conflict or get me into trouble. My parents and I have had arguments about this but my brother has always stood by my side. 

Sometimes I feel bad and wonder if I should just let them handle their finances freely but I know if this same pattern repeats, my brother and I will be the one dealing with consequences. Sometimes I feel like I am being too controlling."
amitheasshole,AITA for wearing underwear to sleep,2508,2025-04-29 23:15:48,587,"For contexts I am a male who lives with my parents and siblings. I live in the southern part of the US and it is starting to get hot again and as a result I‚Äôve started to go to sleep only wearing a pair of boxers. I‚Äôve done this for most of my life and have never had a problem until this morning. The reason why I might be the asshole is because today my brother and his girlfriend walked into my room with zero warning to wake me up. I don‚Äôt know what he expected to see and why he would bring his girlfriend in the room too but I woke up to them walking in and like any other healthy dude I was rock hard. I realized and immediately tried to cover up but the damage was already done. My brother turned his girl around and told her to go wait downstairs. He then proceeds to get mad at me for being hard. I tried to tell him that it‚Äôs normal and he should have expected me to not be wearing much since it‚Äôs a normal thing for me and my other brothers to wear as little as possible when sleeping but he would not calm down. So now I‚Äôm being forced to wear pants while I sleep because he told my dad and he agrees with my brother. I personally don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs much of a problem. He was actually more mad that he seen my dick than his girlfriend seeing it. But we all have one so I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs such a big deal so tell me, am I in the wrong?

EDIT: I don‚Äôt have a lock on my door that‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt locked. His girlfriend came with him because they were both trying to ask me to drive them somewhere because my brother doesn‚Äôt have a license and neither does she.

UPDATE: So last night I talked to my dad better about what happened and he is still being weird about it and told me that if my brother has his girlfriend over that I have to ‚Äúcover up‚Äù. Literally sounds like I‚Äôm making this up but I‚Äôm so fr. He also told my brother to learn how to knock or he‚Äôs not gonna be happy with what he sees. I started arguing with my brother over this and told him I‚Äôm simply just not gonna wear anything because it‚Äôs my room which is my own private space. He got mad and started saying I had a small dick and I told him what most of the comments said and said he wouldn‚Äôt be so mad if his was bigger but that‚Äôs when my dad got involved again and told us to go to our rooms. The whole thing has just gone way out of proportion and it should not have become such a problem. I ended up going to sleep naked last night because I thought it would be funny and when my dad woke me up like an hour ago to get ready for school he got mad at me for disrespecting him in his house but I‚Äôm just ignoring them right now and it‚Äôll calm down eventually.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my mother that she can't vent to me anymore?,19,2025-05-01 01:40:01,32,"My mother (39F) frequently gets into disagreements and fights with my step-father (43M). These arguments have been a staple of their marriage, and I don't see them going away any time soon.

I (18M) have frequently played therapist for my mother. When I was younger, I'd often console her, maybe occasionally give her advice. Now, it's become fairly common practice for my mother to vent to me about her problems after her fights with my step-father.

The issue: I've just began college. I'm finding it difficult to juggle my mother's problems, as well as my studies, since I always feel tapped out and exhausted after helping my mother.

So two weeks ago, when my mother called after what I believe to be one of her and my step-father's biggest arguments yet, I refused her. 

I told her that I've got exams coming up (a lie), and that I really don't have the time to listen to this. I tried to be as polite as possible, but I offended my mother nonetheless, and she hung up upset.

She's still upset, and the argument my mother had with my step-father is still ongoing. Had I intervened, everything would have been settled by now, so I'm beginning to feel guilty.

Am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I asked my ex to give me back my Nintendo Switch?,0,2025-05-01 16:58:54,44,"Background: I got a Switch as a gift when I was in uni ages ago, I loved the hell out of it. I met my ex in my final year and we moved in together after I graduated. For context, our relationship was rocky and lasted four years, with some boundary issues and difficulties after he wanted to open the relationship and crossed lines there, too. Eventually I broke up with him and moved out. It's been three years since.

While were together, I got a Lite as a secondary Switch and he offered to mod my original Switch (apparently it was v1 and easier to mod). I agreed because it mutually benefited us since he was offering to yarhar some games for both of us to play. Over the years it kinda became ""his"" Switch since he spent more time on it and I spent more time on my Lite, but I still considered it shared.

We never explicitly discussed what would happen to it when I moved out, but at the time it felt fair to ""pay"" him for his work modding it by letting him keep it. He didn't bring it up then and hasn't since.

I have difficulty talking to him sometimes still but we do talk regularly, and while I left on difficult terms because our breakup was one-sided (he didn't get why I was so unhappy), things have mellowed out considerably since and he's even apologized for what happened while we were dating. On my end, I paid half the rent to him for a year and a half after I left because I felt guilty leaving suddenly and have worked on moving on from those negative feelings in the past.

Over the years I have thought about asking him to give it back, but I have no clue how to. I do miss it and it has some sentimental value as it was a gift from a friend, at a time when we both were pretty poorly off. I don't plan to resell it or anything and I don't care if he ""unmod""s it. I have been questioning if IWBTA if I asked him to send it back. A quick Google says it's around $120-140 for modding services, and I kind of feel like I've ""paid my dues"" giving him rent money for so long after I left (I know that is a bit of an AH thought). I am happily willing to cover shipping in any case because that's just fair to do. We live pretty far apart so it's not possible to meet up and ask for it in person, and I wouldn't want to.

Logistically, I'm not super worried about damage/sabotage or anything since he has a side hustle modding consoles on ebay and is used to shipping electronic, and he's not that kind of guy. I just am not sure whether it's right to ask at this point after three years...

TL;DR: ex modded my old Switch while we were living together. We never discussed ownership when I left him 3 years ago. I'm happy to pay shipping but more unsure about paying him for modding it. WIBTA if I asked him to send it back?

Edit: since a lot of people seem to be misreading, a few key points to clear up: 

\- we are still in regular contact, I don't really need an ""excuse"" to talk to him 

\- the Switch was a gift *to me* in 2017, not to him. I had it before I ever met him

\- we both have secondary Switches since the modded Switch can't really go online without getting banned. I would not have asked if I would be taking away a Switch from someone who doesn't have one"

I love spending time with the toddler, but because it is my mom's day, I don't want to bring the kid along. I also want to do something that is just siblings and mom because we haven't really spent that much time together just us.

The part where I may be the asshole is about excluding my step-dad from the mother's day activities. He often talks about feeling left out of the family, not feeling like he's our ""real dad"", and lack of respect. I did get into a fight with him a couple of days ago, so truthfully, he is not my favorite person right now. But, I also just want to spend time with my mom. Step-dad's mom also came to visit, so I'm thinking he can spend the mother's day with his mom and his daughter and family while we hang out with my mom. We can also do something together towards the end of the day as family.

Anyways, WIBTA if I excluded step-parent from mother's day plans despite his feelings of often feeling excluded from the family?

  
UPDATE: I think the overall consensus is I should ask my Mom whether she wants to include step-dad and toddler. I personally think my Mom would‚Äôve been okay with them not being included for part of the mother‚Äòs day plans. It makes sense that some people may not agree with my opinion considering the internet obviously does not have insight into the dynamics of my family LOL. To stay on the safe side, I‚Äòll ask her what she would prefer on her day. Thanks everyone!"

I need to know what people think about this situation because I‚Äôve had mixed reviews. I work in a cafe setting and today was the first day of a new product. I wasn‚Äôt told what it was so I went to ask one of the kitchen staff what was in it and then my manager, very abruptly out of the blue said to the kitchen staff in-front of me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell her what‚Äôs in it because she‚Äôll eat it all!‚Äù Which I turned around immediately and had absolutely nothing to say. He was laughing and I was in shock.

For context i (18 f) started this job a mere 2 months ago so it‚Äôs not like ive know this person for a long time now. I also am mid sized, I eat reasonably healthy and try to walk as often as I can. I suffer with body image issues and anxiety and for the first time ever I wore leggings to work instead of cargo pants because I felt comfortable and wanted to fit in with my co workers.   

I am quite hurt, anxious and now uncomfortable to eat at work. I told my co workers what he said and was told that ‚Äúit was rude of him, but he says stuff like that all the time.‚Äù Like that makes it ok?! I know that he meant it as a joke but it was nor funny or appropriate. Am I right in thinking he was implying I am fat?

amitheasshole,AITA for booking a holiday which overlaps with my mum's birthday?,156,2025-04-30 12:23:45,261,"Me (F26) and my husband (M27) booked to go to Rome March 2026. I did the booking and I did a silly mistake which I have admitted - I wasn't looking at the date, I looked at the cheapest price. Booked the holiday, happy days. However, realised the date. We fly 1 day before my mum's birthday and I said to her that I will try to amend the date.

I emailed the company, they said they couldn't amend it so I enquired about cancelling. ¬£400+ to cancel. I enquired again about amending it/changing the date to a week later. Whilst waiting for the email reply, I messaged my mum to explain and say I have tried.

I woke up in the morning to her message saying she was upset and disappointed and felt like she was at the bottom of my list.

We've not had the easiest relationship and we are in a good place. I spoke to my colleagues who are roughly same age as my mum and have children that are my age. They have said that I've tried to rectify it and they wouldn't mind if their kids missed their birthdays as long as they still celebrated. I did say this to my mum and said we can celebrate when we get back (4 days after her birthday) as she refuses to celebrate before (2 days) due to superstitions.

I just feel awful and have done because I made a stupid mistake which I know I could have easily avoided. It's not a big birthday for her (like 50th / 60th etc) and I have tried so hard. 

The company replied and said to change the dates it would be a further ¬£550.

I just feel shit and despite our rocky relationship and the childhood abuse I experienced, I thought we were in a good place and feel like we aren't.

So, AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA when Roommate went through my messages and found personal conversations and won't speak to me?,84,2025-04-30 15:30:21,67,"My roommate stopped talking to me for 2 days, and finally, last night, she texted me why. She told me that she went through my Apple Watch while I was gone and read the text conversations between me and my mom. In those conversations, I had complained about her and her poor habits being a roommate. I thought because it was my mom, I wasn't doing any harm. I wasn't talking badly about her to others. My mom is my best friend and lets me vent whenever I need to. 

Her mom blocked me on all social medias before I even knew what was going on, and is an avid poster online, especially TikTok. She has reposted some cruel things about me, how everyone perceives me as a ""nice girl"" yet I'm secretly a bad person, or that I am jealous of my roommate and want to be her (which is really not true). My roommate is from my hometown and didn't have any friends in high school and neither did her mom, therefore I knew that maybe dealing with drama would be difficult because she had been involved in drama before. 

I got really upset when I saw those reposts. I promise I am a nice person who cares about everyone, but sometimes I needed to vent to my mom when my room was moldy, or my roommate was always naked, or my roommate left old food all over the floor. I tried to talk to my roommate about it, but she never really interpreted as something she needed to fix. 

  
Anyways, the room is really awkward now because my roommate won't talk to me and slams doors and just looks angry all the time. According to her moms mean reposts, clearly she thinks there was nothing wrong with her going through my personal messages. I want to talk to her and tell her that is absolutely unacceptable and crazy. How do I do this is a calm, collected way? 

I hope she didn't see personal things about my family life, personal issues, or protected data that would have been sent in conversations between my mom and I. I am really dumbfounded why any roommate would go through a text string. 

I know I shouldn't have been talking bad about her. I definitely learned my lesson to put passwords on things and such and to limit my crap talking. "
amitheasshole,AITA for essentially telling my friend that therapy isn't working for them,6,2025-05-01 07:30:14,18,"Basically I (25M) am getting a license to drive soon due to travel needs that I can no longer rely on public transport for, and lyft would be very expensive. While I know how to drive, I am blind in one eye since childhood, and am aware that that severe blindspot could be dangerous if im not fully correcting for it. I have already explained to my friends I will not drive in the dark or when I am tired, as I know I will have a lack of awareness. 

My friend (22 M) has been in several minor car accidents and one major one in the last year causing a car replacement. They do not like driving because ""no one can drive right"" and have road rage stemming from lack of patience. Our group and even their parents know their last car accident was their fault but they do not believe so. We tried to explain after some time had passed that they needed to address their impatience, and they've refused to hear it. 

I was confiding with one friend separately that I am terrified of driving because even if the other person is in the wrong, if something happens and someone gets injured or killed, it doesn't matter who's right or wrong at that point. Like even if I do everything right, I could still get into an accident. My road rage friend overheard and said ""same bro"", and we both looked at him and were silent after that. He went on to say ""it doesn't matter what you do since it just takes one person to fuck up"". 

We got into an argument and I told him ""this isn't the same thing because I can't get my eyesight back no matter what I do, but at least you could improve your lack of patience, you just choose not to."" And when he came back with I'm working on it I threw back that he's been working on it for three years (he started therapy for separate reasons that fed into anger issues) and it's improved jack shit, we just talk to you less when you're pissy. I don't think your working on anything. 

We haven't talked since, the witnessing friend said while I was right that it wasn't the same, it wasn't fair to judge their progress based on what we see. I don't really think I'm wrong though. I know therapy takes time, and it doesn't make you undamaged, I just don't think they're making a conscious effort to mitigated that damage and are using my situation to validate themselves ignoring their own problems.

AITA for essentially telling them they aren't making progress in therapy?

In case this is needed, I also went to therapy for a long time growing up because of anger issues and depression. The reason they started therapy was because they used to use me as a therapist since they knew I had anger issues. At one point life got really stressed and I told them I couldn't do it anymore that they needed professional help."

But I'll let Reddit decide. If I was in the wrong, I'll accepet it and try to do better.

My (32F at the time) friend (29 M at the time) had just started to work as host in a brand new comedian club, so he inveted me to come.  I ended up being the only paying customer there. Everyone else besides my friend and me, was either a comedian or a comedian's partner.

Everything was fine until one comedian during his perfomance started interacting with me. He asked me to clap my hands and so I did, so he goes: ""everytime I tell a joke would clap for me, sweetheart?"" I laughet and said ""no"". I thought he would be cool about it but he seemed really uncomfortable  and said: ""Well feminist women just like to say no, right?""I felt like that was a bit misogynistic but I let it go.

The comedian continued his performance and told a joke about  s***** h**********. I don't remember exactly how it went but was something like: ""The best place to m********e is on public transport"" I felt really uncomfortable about that joke but ok. Later he repeat the same joke and then again later.   He told it three times and no one laughed at any of them

Later he goes: ""Hope you all are having a good time we are here to try new material so if you guys have any feedback it would be welcome"" I looked at my friend beside me and whispered: 'Well... he should just stop doing s***** h********** jokes'.  I honest thought the comedian wouldn‚Äôt hear my comment but oh, he did..

The comedian shoted in a very angry voice  ""I'm going to tell the jokes that I want to"" Then he started to hyperventilate for a while. When he stopped, he said: 'Sorry everyone but when people try to censour us I get really mad'. After that he went on and on about how difficult it is to be a comedian, how his joke are a way to help society and how some stupid people just don't get it.

When he used the word 'stupid,' I got up to smoke to calm down because I was feeling kind of attacked. I walked to the hallway and there was a camera filming and I got caught in the footage apparently.   When I reached the smoking area I realized I forgote my lighter. So I went back to my seat to grab it and once again I was caught on the footage apparently.

After the cigarret I felt calm and the comedian had ended his perfomance  so I decided to let it go and enjoy the rest of the evening. I had fun and met new people but everyone there told me that I should have kept my mouth shut.

2 years later my friend told me that the comedian now tells a joke about how a Karen tried to humiliate him over a silly joke and ruined his footages.  I found that amusing, and I'm flattered that I'm his muse for creating new material... My friends still thinks that I was in the wrong, but honestly, I don't see it. So, Reddit... am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for yelling at my grandmother for constantly LYING,3,2025-05-01 08:19:27,7,"For context, my grandmother constantly lies. ALL OF THE TIME. Pointless lies I feel gaslighted. She secretly smokes in my garage and will deny it. She even stopped taking my dog outside for walks and began throwing him in the garage for hours. I only noticed when the garage began to smell horrible. I originally thought it smelt bad for other reasons. She heard me complaining about it and didn‚Äôt say a word. I basically caught her red-handed bringing my dog back inside one late night from the garage. and you know what she did ..denied having him outside for hours. Smh. fast-forward to the current situation. I have blinds facing the window to my backyard. Well tonight as I was preparing for bed and locking everything up around the house, I noticed a missing blind from the middle of my window. The blind wasn‚Äôt missing before. It had been there all day. Where was it? I immediately knew my grandmother must have moved it because maybe it fell so I called her and asked where is the blind ?? 


I just wanted to put it back up. I don‚Äôt feel safe, not having my  window fully covered at night. When I called to ask, she tried to play dumb. Mind you ..no one else is in the house, but she and I. I worked all day from home. She doesn‚Äôt work. Just sleeps and smokes all day. She denied ever touching or moving the blind, yet it was completely gone!! she began saying and doing a bunch of other things that she always does when she‚Äôs lying. Honestly, at this point, I‚Äôm fed up. It‚Äôs such a small, stupid lie. Nobody else could have done something with the blind, but HER. It‚Äôs like just admit it and tell me where the blind is so I can put it back up!!! I basically went off on her and told her that I know she‚Äôs lying and  not speak to me anymore because I just can‚Äôt take it. She had the audacity to begin shouting that she wasn‚Äôt lying to me when she clearly is. I‚Äôve caught her in lies several times in the past already.

So she called me and I told her I will get ready as soon as I went to the restroom. 
She always gets mad when I have to use toilet before we start doing something together so she tells me I shouldn‚Äôt come pick her up at all and just stay home. After that I still went to her house and she didn‚Äôt let me come inside at first. After she finally let me in, she didn‚Äôt even look at me and got mad when I tried to find out what the problem was. After 15 minutes of ignoring she told me she doesn‚Äôt like that I always have to use the toilet before we plan something. I told her that I‚Äòm sorry and tried to cheer her up by suggesting to get ice cream. She didn‚Äôt like that idea and said that she just doesn‚Äôt want to do anything today even though the weather is nice and we planned to enjoy it today. 
She also said that I never plan things and she Is tired of always planning everything but when I try to plan something we can do together, she always criticises my ideas.
Anyways I suggested some more things to do other than going to the lake but she either ignored everything I said or screamed at me to just go home. 
I really wanted to spend some time outside with her today so I kept on suggesting other things to do which made her even more mad so she kicked me out.
After that I tried to call and text her but she just ignored me and went to sleep.
This scenario plays out every once in a while and I am so tired of it.

We started teasing each other on the way when I told him to stop touching my hand because I know he'd tickle me. He then said he promise he won't tickle me so I did let him hold my hand, not even seconds later he already started to tickle my armpits (we're still walking along the sidewalk where many cars pass by). I was already at the floor sitting just so he could stop him tickling me, and then my phone fell out of my hand. I jokingly said ""what if it cracked?"" And yes it did crack.

I was devastated since it was a new phone my sister got for me. I started silently crying while walking not even finding the energy to continue walking and just wanted to sulk in there while he was laughing, everytime I'd look at him his face was holding back laughter and that made me even more sad. I was blaming him over my cracked screen and he's just laughing, I even told him he would pay for the repair and yes he's still laughing.

At night I told him I can no longer click on my phone smoothly as it did before the crack and he got upset and said ""Let's not talk until I bought you your screen"" and today is his birthday he hasn't responded to any of my messages.

I also feel bad about this that I told him he doesn't have to pay me back since I could see he wasn't willing to base on his actions yesterday. I even want to pay for a gold pass on a game we both play.

It wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve dealt with stuff like that and honestly I just wanted to shrug it off. 

But then my foster dad (41M), complicated I know, overheard and stepped in.

amitheasshole,AITA for criticizing my D&D DM?,0,2025-05-01 20:57:24,15,"Me (14M), and another person I met on a DnD forum (14NB,Nylo), wanted to play DnD, after a little while of searching we found a DM that was willing to DM for us, so the DM invited us to a small beginner friendly DnD server, in that DnD server the owner decided to play with us to teach us the ropes, since the beginning we said that something more RP focused and less combat focused would be better for us since we were both beginners but that combat was still okay. When we started the session instead of starting off in a role-play setting so we could get to know each other's characters, get to know the actual story and to just adjust to the whole DnD system we start on a flying ship with 14 kobolds that gradually destroy the ship, we had to defeat them all before they could destroy the ship, we were a party of 3 and instead of taking out some kobolds so it would be easier for us, he kept the same exact number he intended for 4 players to fight, not only that each enemy was a singular troop and (if you play DnD) you know that if you are fighting a large group of enemies, it's best to make them a group of 3-4 and make that group count as one enemy so you don't spend 15 minutes rolling for each enemy.

Needless to say the ship crashed, so I thought that now we would have some roleplay, maybe we lost our memories and we had to get to know each other again, maybe we were going to get saved by some locals but no, we got into another fight with around 8 bandits.

after we finished the 4 hour session (keep in mind we spent an hour and a half on the kobold fight and half an hour on the bandit fight which we didn't have time to finish) I went on DM's and talked with the DM giving him feedback on the session, I said that it was kinda overwhelming for me and it was probably overwhelming for Nylo too, that for our next session something more role-play focused would be best since that's where most beginners have trouble on.

He said that he understood and that he would address my feedback in our next session, so I thought that it was all good.

20 minutes later the owner messaged me saying that I wasn't a DM, so I shouldn't be trying to give feedback since I don't have experience, and that I made them reschedule because I was busy during the time we previously agreed on, which is true but I only found out I was gonna be busy for that day AFTER we scheduled.

After that he said that he doesn't think i'm fit for the server and promptly ghosted me, I apologized to him and the DM and said that I wasn't lecturing him, just giving him feed back, 2 days later they banned me and Nylo from the server, Nylo then asked me what happened and I told them the truth, I gave the DM my feedback on the session and they banned me for lecturing the DM.

Nylo then said that it was rude what I did and that I should not have spoke for them, then blocked me.

I think I was rude and ungrateful since they decided to play and DM 2 fresh beginner teens, so AITA?

My dad and I have a complicated relationship. He is a good parent but is extremely emotionally needy and often lacks boundaries. He has been divorced from my mom for the past 18 years and has never dated anyone since and has very few friends which I think contributed to this encounter as he often very lonely and has a lot of free time. 

This month he was planning to fly in on Friday (April 28th) and stay for ‚Äúfour or five days‚Äù. When talking on the phone he mentioned he was off until the fourth of May and could stay 8 days total. I expressed that I work full time in a stressful job, am currently dog sitting and will also be going on a weekend trip soon so that wouldn‚Äôt work for me. He immediately called my mom and expressed that as his child I should be happy for him to stay as long as he wants and lamented that he must be ‚Äúso insufferable to deal with‚Äù.

On Monday my dad had now been staying with me since Friday and I asked him when his flight home was. He flys standby so things are very flexible. He said that he wanted to stay with me longer and I expressed that I would prefer if he would go home on the originally planned date. I expressed that I live in a small apartment and having him on my couch is not ideal and I have a routine and schedule that I had planned around him going home on Monday or Tuesday. He became extremely upset and said that as his child I am not ‚Äúletting him stay with me and that family should be able to stay as long as they want‚Äù. He then immediately changed his flight to that night and grabbed his bags and left in a huff and has not spoken to me since. 

Am I the asshole for having the expectation that when a guest is visiting they would adhere to that timeline?

My (24F) fiance (25M) are getting married in June and we‚Äôve invited our families, obviously. The colors we chose are light blue, tan, and navy blue. For a little bit of context, my parents went through a horrible divorce when I was 13. My dad‚Äôs mom (the grandma I‚Äôm talking about) was VERY hateful to my mom and just outright disrespectful to her so I‚Äôm not her biggest fan. She‚Äôs always gone against the rules and done whatever she‚Äôs wanted to with no repercussions. She enables my dad who is an addict and she knows it‚Äôs wrong (not important but just trying to set the scene). It‚Äôs a little awkward going to family gatherings on my dad‚Äôs side because I feel like the black sheep of the family. My sister (33F) is my half sister on my dad‚Äôs side, we‚Äôve become closer through the years. 
My grandma called me about 2pm today and we talked about wedding stuff and she asked me what I wanted her to wear. I told her I wasn‚Äôt picky, just no white and no light blue. 

Later today, my sister and my grandma went to JCPenny to shop. My sister found a dress she loved, it‚Äôs also important to note my sister is a bridesmaid in my wedding. They are wearing light blue. My grandma sees the dress and loves it as well saying it would be perfect for the wedding. However, she meant for herself. Not for my sister. My grandma bought a light blue (almost white) dress to wear to our wedding. My sister told me about it, as she thought my grandma had bought the dress for her and didn‚Äôt realize that she bought it for herself (my sister is not the brightest bulb in the box), and my grandma picked the dress when my sister walked away from it because it was too expensive for her to buy for herself. I know this is my grandma, it‚Äôs not that deep, but it does upset me she chose a color I specifically asked her to not wear as my wedding party is wearing that color. Since she has a habit of going against the rules and wearing whatever she wants, this doesn‚Äôt surprise me. We have recently thought she has been having some memory problems, but I‚Äôm not sure. I haven‚Äôt confronted her yet but I plan to. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being an asshole by confronting her. TIA! "

Here‚Äôs the deal: when I moved in, I wasn‚Äôt aware that she had the appliances and bed included in both of our rents. She had the bigger room with free access to the AC and geyser (I had to rent my own), and she used a lot of my personal stuff, including my extension cords, kitchen utensils, and spices. I didn‚Äôt complain about it at first, but over time, I started feeling like I was the one doing everything while she barely contributed to housework or bills.

Things really started to fall apart when it came to the electricity bill. I was always the one paying, even though she was using more of the utilities, and she never contributed much. The final straw came when we discussed the electricity bill, and she insisted I pay 1,000 rupees, even though my share, based on my usage, was no more than 600. She also claimed the light had been left on for 14 days, but the AC was on every night, and on weekends, it would run the entire day. I didnt even have an AC. I tried to explain this, but in the end, I agreed to pay 800 to avoid further conflict.

The situation escalated when I told her I was leaving. She demanded I either pay for another 15 days or find a replacement, citing the inconvenience she would face. She wanted the flat vacated by the 1st, so I ended up leaving a day earlier than planned.

When I packed up to leave, I packed up my kitchen items first, depriving her of any utensils to cook with or even basic things like salt and sugar. I didn‚Äôt help her with the garbage, especially since she had been gone for the last 7 days and expected me to clean everything up for the new person moving in. I also took back my extension cord, which she had been using to power the fridge, and I left the curtain rod down for the next person to use.

After I left, she started messaging me, calling me inconsiderate and selfish. She accused me of ruining everything over small issues like garbage, even though I felt like I was just standing up for myself after 1.5 years of trying to make things work.

Now, I‚Äôm wondering if I handled things badly. Did I go too far by leaving early and depriving her of what she needed to move forward? AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for snapping at my MIL after she said we don‚Äôt do enough around the house?,0,2025-05-01 16:27:12,46,"My fianc√© (23M) and I (21F) moved onto his family‚Äôs property to help out. Before this, we were homeless on and off for two years due to rent increases. During that time, we experienced severe trauma, including a friend being killed in front of us. (Mentioning this for mental health context.)

His grandma‚Äôs health declined, so I (a CNA) suggested we help. We live in a trailer on the property, and his family (including MIL, 46F) lives in the main house. The house had mold in every room, rotting food in the pantry, no stove. We‚Äôve been slowly cleaning and fixing things.

Fianc√© has a rocky history with his family‚Äîemotionally unavailable parents, lots of blame-shifting. He moved out at 18. MIL claims she kicked him out, but we had already planned the move.

I‚Äôm not trying to villainize her‚Äîshe has her struggles‚Äîbut she‚Äôs emotionally volatile. Disagreeing with her often leads to yelling.

Recently, we left a thawing turkey out, and the cat got to it. MIL wanted to ‚Äúcut around‚Äù the damaged part. I said that wasn‚Äôt safe (her mom has lupus, and my fianc√© has a weak immune system). Later, my fianc√© threw it away. MIL came down yelling at me. He stepped in and admitted he did it, but she called us selfish. Two days later, she apologized and asked for patience.

Then today, his car wouldn‚Äôt start. He asked to use her car, which she doesn‚Äôt drive. She refused and brought up damage to our car (from a UPS accident). When we didn‚Äôt argue, she said we don‚Äôt do enough around the house.

I‚Äôve had open-heart surgery and a hip replacement due to a bad sports accident. Still, I hike up a hill every day to help Grandma‚Äîsweep, mop, do dishes, clean, feed animals. My fianc√© works full-time and helps around the property (28 acres). We haven‚Äôt kept up with the generator, which is fair, but we‚Äôre adjusting. We both grew up in the city.

When she told us to ‚Äúgrow the f*** up,‚Äù I snapped. I told her, ‚ÄúYou asked for patience days ago. We‚Äôve been here 3 weeks. You‚Äôve been here a year. Just give us some grace.‚Äù I said if she needed something, she should just ask‚Äîwe‚Äôre not mind readers.

Her response: ‚ÄúI want you to see into the future.‚Äù

I was stunned.

I understand this has been hard for her. I feel bad for snapping. But we do a lot. She hasn‚Äôt left her room since we got here. We‚Äôve shown her so much grace‚ÄîI just want the same.

amitheasshole,AITA. I called my friend a slut bc she made fun of me for being virgin.,0,2025-05-01 21:25:36,49,"So I have this friend (22 F) that sleeps around very frequently. Going at it with almost every guy she get a connection with. Lately she has been making fun of me (23 M) for being a virgin which is by choice. I have denied from 2 girls because we didn't have that kinda connection yet. So my friend saying that made me kinda mad. So when venting to other friends I refered to her as a slut. After words i said I shouldn't have called her that. My friend told me I'm sexist for saying that and have a huge masculine ego bc it's her body her choice. Which is fair, but my choice for my body is to not sleep around. So their response was that I'm weak for being hurt by that and need to grow up. Is that being sexist or just equal?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not buying food/snacks to share with my friends when hanging out even though they all do?,18,2025-04-30 21:57:18,8,"So I have this friend group, and when we hang out after school we always go to the local shopping plaza on the way to my friend Lena‚Äôs house. Almost every time, we end up at her place.

It‚Äôs become a routine to stop and buy snacks to eat at hers. I don‚Äôt feel the need or want to do this every time. I like food, but it‚Äôs become excessive, and I don‚Äôt want to keep using my own money on it. Everyone shares what they buy, but it happens every single time.

I‚Äôve stopped going to every hangout because I honestly don‚Äôt enjoy them anymore. We just sit on our phones at Lena‚Äôs house doing nothing. I have to make the trip home afterward, while Lena doesn‚Äôt have to do anything. She never wants to go to anyone else‚Äôs house either. Ruby has invited us over, and lots of us would prefer that, but Lena always makes excuses. It‚Äôs obvious she just doesn‚Äôt want to leave her house.

Lena kind of acts like the leader of the group. She brought us all together and uses that to control everything. She always wants her way, and it‚Äôs frustrating. If I start getting closer to Maya (who I talk to a lot), Lena gets jealous. Maya and Lena are close because they live near each other and Lena‚Äôs mum gives her a ride to school. Chloe and Ruby are best friends and usually pair off too. I‚Äôm just kind of‚Ä¶ there.

Recently, they‚Äôve started making comments about how I never spend money when we go out. It started with Lena (I didn‚Äôt care, because she always has weird opinions), but when the others kind of agreed, it made me wonder if I was being unfair.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm not poor. I have money. So does Lena ‚Äî we‚Äôre on the same level. The difference is how our parents handle money. Lena gets money constantly, spends heaps at the canteen, and can just ask for more. I get money too, but I‚Äôm expected to use it responsibly. I can‚Äôt just blow it all on food every time. But because I come from a family with money, they assume I should be spending more.

Sometimes Lena wants me to buy whole packets of an ingredient for something she wants to make (that I have no interest in) when SHE HAS IT ALREADY AT HER HOUSE!

It‚Äôs not like I never buy food, especially if it‚Äôs for everyone. But I‚Äôm not going to drop $10 every hangout just to make Lena feel better. What happens when it‚Äôs her birthday and she expects a huge gift? She doesn‚Äôt understand that I don‚Äôt get money in the same way.

I also have to ask my parents every time I want to go out. It‚Äôs not strict, but it gets annoying, especially when it‚Äôs to Lena‚Äôs house, where I don‚Äôt even enjoy being. If I say no, they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even doing anything, why can‚Äôt you come?‚Äù They don‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs actually a hassle for me ‚Äî and boring.

So yeah. I‚Äôm not stingy, I‚Äôm not broke, and I‚Äôm not trying to be difficult. I just don‚Äôt want to waste my money every time we hang out, especially when I‚Äôm not enjoying it. But now that they‚Äôve pointed it out, I‚Äôm starting to wonder ‚Äî AITA?
"
amitheasshole,AITA for charging $50 a day to house sit Aunt's place,248,2025-04-30 06:49:15,104,"So I guess some context. My Aunt often goes on vacation and needs someone to look after the house. She has a dog, cat, 2 birds, and a teenage son on the spectrum that I look after. I don't do it for the money but she typically gives between $20-30 cad a day to do this. 

The typical day involves feeding cat twice a day, cleaning litter box, walking the dog 3 times (morning, afternoon, and night), feeding dog twice a day, dog dental bone late morning, making sure birds are fed (the son takes care of that most of the time), and cleaning up after her son. The latter can often take 30 minutes a day or more as he makes quite a mess. She does provide some food that the son and I can eat (I also make food for the son / make sure he eats).

She is going to Europe for a month and wanted me to house sit for her again. This time however I am full time in university and also working part time. I'd definitely lose time at work because I can't leave the dog for more than 7 hours and I make $35 cad / hour as a lifeguard. I asked for $50 a day to help offset this. The going rate in my area is $75-100 dollars a day plus pets. 

My Aunt texted me rather passive aggressively that $50/day was way to steep and that I won't have to take time off work or clean up after her son which simply is not the case. She's been trying to guilt me into feeling like she's doing a favour for me for getting a place to stay and food in the fridge. The reality is that I will be losing money plus have all the responsibility of taking care of her household.

AITA for asking for better compensation."
amitheasshole,AITA for moving out of the apartment I share with my brother?,18,2025-04-30 19:52:40,11,"All of this started about half a year ago. My brother and I share an apartment. We moved out of our mother's apartment about five years ago with the support of our father, who agreed to rent the apartment with us. The reason for this was that at the time I was doing an apprenticeship and therefore only earned a small amount of money. And my brother was self-employed, which meant he had no steady income. Both of these were a red flag for the landlord. My father rented the apartment for us because he earned a lot of money as a police superintendent. We paid for everything by transferring the money to him, but he was registered as the main tenant. And I transferred ‚Ç¨600 a month to my brother for food shopping, because it was easier than taking turns paying for the shopping all the time.

At some point, we moved house with the same arrangement. Since I had completed my training by then, I was now earning significantly more money. And when my father retired last year, all contracts were transferred to my account. Electricity, gas, rent, internet and pretty much all other bills were now paid by me, since my brother was still self-employed and had no steady income. My brother managed to persuade me that if I simply transferred him less money each month for shopping, this would reflect his share of these costs and since he pays taxes and insurance himself, we would be paying the same. And that sounded plausible to me at first, which is why I agreed. However, he didn't pay a cent for the grocery shopping because it was all deducted from the monthly ‚Ç¨600. This means that the only costs he now bears are the monthly grocery purchases. And even the taxes and insurance that he has to pay as part of his self-employment are not considered living expenses and therefore cannot be counted as ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù costs, since he would have to pay them anyway if he lived alone.

My father then said that he felt that my brother was taking advantage of me financially, but I told him that we were helping each other. I had no problem covering the costs. Until last month, when I had to pay a large back tax bill as part of my tax return. At the same time, my brother received a huge tax refund. We are talking about a four-digit amount that could easily have covered my back tax payment. But instead of even considering helping me, I, who no longer knew where he would get the money for the tax, had to watch my brother buy a new PC. In the end, I was able to pay the tax because my mother lent me the money.

And I finally had enough. My father was on my side in this matter and said that I should not let myself be taken advantage of and he helped me look for a place to live on my own. My brother was furious. He told me that I was abandoning him, that I was being selfish, and that he had done so much for me that I knew nothing about. When I asked him what he had done for me, he had no answer. He accused me of wanting to make him homeless. So AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not telling my two best friends each other‚Äôs secrets before they started dating?,2257,2025-04-29 17:47:58,256,"So I (27M) have two best friends ‚Äî a guy and a girl ‚Äî who didn‚Äôt know each other until I introduced them a few years ago. I‚Äôve known them separately for a long time and know a lot of their personal secrets, which they confided in me in trust.

They hit it off after hanging out with me once and eventually started dating. I was genuinely happy for them at the time.

Fast forward a few years, and things went south. They both found out personal things about each other that I already knew ‚Äî and now they‚Äôre both mad at me.

My female best friend had been previously married, and my male best friend is a virgin. He was furious that I didn‚Äôt tell him, saying he would‚Äôve never dated someone who wasn‚Äôt also a virgin. On the flip side, she found out he‚Äôs a porn addict, which was something he had confided in me, and she‚Äôs disgusted by it. She says if she‚Äôd known earlier, she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten into a relationship with him.

Now, instead of being upset with each other, they‚Äôre blaming me for ‚Äúwasting their time‚Äù by not disclosing these things upfront. But I never told either of them the other‚Äôs secrets because I didn‚Äôt think it was my place to do that. They trusted me, and I didn‚Äôt feel like I had the right to betray that trust.

Still, now I‚Äôm the bad guy in both their eyes.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for not telling them each other‚Äôs secrets? Knowing well they would never date if they knew beforehand "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend if she's going to just throw what I make away she can cook for herself?,2533,2025-04-29 17:05:31,187,"I (30M) live with my little brother (28M) and my girlfriend (30F) and sometimes neither of us will feel like cooking, so when the other goes to cook we ask them to cook for us too. It's a system that works out and not one thats abused, we normally cook for ourselves but sometimes we also cook a big meal for everyone in the house. We also all pitch in for the grocery bill, most of whats in the house is for us to use and specific stuff meant for just that person are marked and told in advance. 

Lately when my girlfriend has asked me to cook her something that I am making for myself and I have, I wake up the next morning to find most or all of it in the garbage. I am not a world class cook by any means, but I don't burn my food or under season it either. After the last time when she asked me to cook her something I told her no, that I am tired of seeing food wasted (not to mention the time I took to cook for her) and that if she's going to keep throwing food away like that, she can cook for herself.

My brother agrees with me on the subject. That the food waste is annoying and frustrating to see and it needs to end. Some of our friends agree too while others are saying I should just cook for her anyways and calling me an asshole for ""letting her go hungry"".

amitheasshole,AITA for going to 2 old friends weddings without my partner,4,2025-05-01 02:24:49,37,"Hi, so I have been dating my partner for almost 5 years now, and just recently I have been invited to 2 separate weddings from old friends I've know ln through school for 10 years +. 
So the issue is they are both wanting SMALL weddings that aren't gonna break the bank. And my invite was for only myself, no +1 for my partner.  Both of the brides have only met my partner a couple times at functions or whatever. 

My partner is mad at me and saying I'm TA for wanting to go to the weddings. Saying it's super disrespectful to her and shit of my friends.  

The way I see it is, I don't make the guest list, I don't set the budget so I don't get a say.  And it would be rude of me to ask the bride and groom for a plus 1. 
She's asking me to miss at least one or she is going to have a huge problem with it.

Why should I miss out on seeing my friends life achievement because she's upset she's not invited?
So AITA if i go to both weddings?"
amitheasshole,AITA for possibly regretting looking after my father after our history?,22,2025-04-30 18:32:28,52,"That title makes me sound like the asshole, but please read, I know it's long, I apologise

So my father married a filipino woman 20 years younger who kicked me out at 8 years old. He would have me for one night a week.

This was all because the wife had started screaming and demanding him to call my mother and that I had to leave, because I was just a curious kid while having a shower before bed. I noticed this bodywash I had never seen before so I had a look. It was slippery, fell out of my hands which led to it opening and the lid cracking on the side. I even apologized for it.

Didn't see or hear from him for years, every time I tried to contact him to talk, she would make him hang up the phone. She changed numbers but my uncle would always give it to me as he wanted me to have it. I got invited to their house was when they were celebrating their daughter's 3rd birthday (which was random but I got to see my cousin so that was cool), and when he wanted to adopt her niece from the Phillipines. I just said I didnt care

15 years later I'm visiting family in my home town, and decided I would contact him once to see if he would meet for a coffee after asking his brother for his number. Surprisingly he does - but it's only because she wasn't home.

It was awkward, but after all I was the one who made the decision to give him the choice. All he talked about was how his other daughter was doing this and how his wife got a new car and how they went to the US etc. I won't lie, it made me feel shitty deep down. So I changed the subject and I decided to ask him about his hobbies and how the pace car was going. It was one of the things I was supposedly meant to inherit, but he sold it because she wanted the money.

She tried to have him completely get rid of me. Convinced him to write me out of the will - not sure how that works, and apparently dumped my pictures

So now hes 78. Retired and freshly divorced. Barely any money to his name as she drained it all, and they left to aus. I was already planning to move there myself and have been sorting that out for the last couple of years on my own, but he now has no one that can care for him, so I'm the only one who's left around (his brother is older and that wouldn't be fair on him nor his wife). 

Because I'm too soft I said I could, but I don't know how to feel. Regret because I kind of feel like I'm now putting my life aside knowing what happened for all those years, but also guilty for feeling this way and I don't know if its right or wrong.

I understand he's hurting and going through the stress of this happening at his age, but you'd think his other daughter would step up after the life he gave her. Nope. She took 20k and moved. Talked to him once on new years and once in March I believe to ask him for more money, which he gave her.

I eventually found out the bodywash was to clean her nether regions. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for getting my old teacher a goodbye card?,27,2025-04-30 16:32:51,15,"
Hello, 

I am a student at A2 level, and this week makes the final week of school for the year. 

Me and my friend both used to do English last year, but after our other subjects demanded more time we both decided to drop English at different points in the year. Another girl we know in the year did the same but only recently, so very close to the end of the year. 

In our friend group all of our friends used to do English, and now that me and the other friend dropped it we constantly joke about how we are the ‚Äúones that got away‚Äù or ‚Äúescaped‚Äù due to the pressure it puts on the other ones. 

To add to this we both had very good relationships with our teacher. She is a terrifying and intense woman but she still likes us a lot and asks us to do small tasks for her. 

One of my other close friends is an English prefect (basically the teachers unpaid assistant) and is constantly being put on the spot to do tasks along with the subject, and my friend complains about this very often. 

The class is getting the teacher a card, and when I asked my prefect friend if I could sign it she said I couldn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt a part of the class anymore, which I think she meant jokingly. 

Since this is our last week everyone is getting presents for their teachers, and my and my friend who left the subject too decided it would be fun to get a goodbye card to this teacher, just from the three of us who don‚Äôt do the subject anymore. Since she still likes us a lot and misses us we thought it would be cute and a funny play on the fact that we are terrified of her. 

When I told this idea to my prefect friend, she told us not to do that. She called it, ‚Äúpretty selfish‚Äù, and told me flat out not to do it. When I asked why she wouldn‚Äôt give me a straight reason, instead just telling me I could sign the card and she was joking. She also mentioned that the class didn‚Äôt get her much, so I think she‚Äôs scared that we might show them up or take the attention away by making her a card. 

When I told my other friend about this she said I should have lied and not told her because she would have said no, so I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

We got into a little bit of a spat about it and moved on in the conversation, but I think she‚Äôs still annoyed. I am giving her the card because I think it would be a nice thing and fun to do, but now I don‚Äôt know wether to move on or still get the card and do the bit.

So we kinda start but usealy wate untill he calls us again, but today I got sick and stayed home. He didn't call in me untill 9:00 after my mom and brother got home and I was feeling a little better. He decided that it was time to cleen my floor and he sat on my bed and pointed and said pick this up. He started by having me pick up the paper on my floor throw it away. I was tired of him always asking me to do stuff like that. So I did it one at a time instead of picking up multiple and throwing it away. To the point where he decided that he was going to take out his phone and start recording me. He did this untill almost 12:00 am and my mom got mad because he was getting mad at me for ignoring him and not listing to him. Im worrid that this might be my falt because the last time they got into an argument like this was years years ago over a very similer situation and they both later told me that it was my falt because I was instagating. They may think I was instigating because in between being asked to do something in my room like pick up all the paper on the floor I would spend some time in my mom's room so I can cool off cuz it is really hot in the house.

amitheasshole,AITA for trading shifts with a coworker without consulting my husband first?,1,2025-05-01 06:52:27,16,"AITA for trading shifts with a coworker without consulting my husband first? My husband (m32) and I (F31) have been married two years, we have a 2 yo child together. We both started working at the same company about 5 months ago, vastly different positions/departments. He's full time, I'm part time. He was working mornings, and I work swings, so he watches the kid at night.

However, He just got moved to graveyard shift, I got my schedule changed so our hours don't completely overlap, but we will still have to swap cars with the kid at night (I'm off at 10:30, he starts at 10:50).

My coworker has an event to attend at the end of the month, she's been bringing it up repeatedly for the past month, and I'm 90% sure I've mentioned to it my husband that she wants to swap shifts with me for that weekend. I worked things out with my mom to take care of the kid for the night (she watches said kid daily when I go to my other part time job) and so I told my coworker, yes, I can work for her that night. I would be off at 12:30am.

I got home and wrote it on our calendar that the kid will be sleeping over at mom's that night. Husband flipped out, saying I'm not acting like we're married, im married to my mom, ect. 

He's been against me working at the same company since day 1 when we went to orientation together, saying that this wasn't going to work ( he said that about any other job i tried to get). We have 2 vehicles now, my parents live close by so babysitting usually isnt an issue. He didn't bother watching our child for the first year and a half, my mom did while I went to my part time job and he just stayed home to sleep. We never saw eachother then (or now), and when I needed help I went to my mom, so then he started snapping at me that I'm married to my mother and not him. 

I should mention he's an alcoholic, and his reliability has left me feeling like a single mother more often than not, so i tend to handle situations myself than try to depend on him.

TLDR: AITA for swapping a shift and finding a free babysitter without telling my husband, when we work at the same company and our shifts would overlap?"

Before he could get involved, his foster dad (41m) came in and decked the guy! After the tension died my boyfriend went outside to speak to his dad, but after 5 minutes he came back furious and said we're leaving.

I asked why and he said he was outraged at his dad's actions? I tried to reason with him saying that he was only defending you because you're his family but he wasn't having any of it. I decided that night that I wasn't going home with him because it was like he was a completely different person. He messaged me begging to come to his house later, but I aired all the dm's. After some thought I decided to break up with him

Earlier on snap he messaged me saying his dad was in hospital after suffering a pretty serious accident whilst playing golf and he's critical. He asked me to come over so we can talk but I've half swiped all the messages so it looks like I haven't seen them.

After he nearly fell backwards over a bin and myself, I let out a slight outburst of my dissatisfaction of the situation and concern for the safety of the child. Everyone looked at me as if I was an idiot.
I stepped off the cook line and out of the kitchen to calm down. On my return I then discover (by nearly knocking the child over with a prep trolley) that the KM had detached the child from himself, put the kid in the biggest high chair we have in the restaurant, and placed said chair and kid at the end of the cook line obscuring the gangway (which also serves as the main fire escape route), under the equipment kill switches.

I was about to explode with rage at this point, so I pleaded, albeit slightly angrily, if the child could be removed from the kitchen. Again I was met with stares as if I was being an idiot and AH.

Almost all of my co workers have sided with the KM/father of the child and I am now outcast in my workplace...

AITA for reacting on my belief that babies should not be allowed in comercial kitchens or on a cook line during operational hours?"
amitheasshole,AITA for going to a party against a friends wishes because of her ex,22,2025-04-30 17:00:08,36,"This is a long story, but I will try to keep it short. About a year and a half ago, my (32M) wife's (36F) best friend Sadie was dumped by her long-term boyfriend of ten years. He said that he had fallen out of love and came home one night and just said it was over. She took it hard, as anyone would, and for the next year or so, my wife and I took on the primary emotional support of the friend group--inviting her over for dinner, letting her stay with us, helping her move out of the house they shared, etc. During that time, she wasn't getting over the breakup, but she was steadily moving in the right direction--going to a therapist and working through it. She accused him of cheating, but that wasn't really substantiated.

About six months into the breakup, she was staying with another friend Pam, who was going through her own personal stuff that we didn't know about, namely, a divorce that she had yet to make public. One night, Pam said to Sadie that because her boyfriend didn't cheat on her or abuse her, she just needed to get over it and it wasn't a big deal. Of course, we thought this was a callous, stupid, and insensitive thing to say. However, in the aftermath, Sadie basically decided to cut off that entire side of the friend group. We spent a lot of time trying to get them to reconcile, trying to get Pam to apologize, but nothing worked. We understood Sadie cutting off the friend group, however, we are friends with many people in Pam's orbit, and were somewhat unwilling to cut those people off as we had just moved o the city we now live in and enjoy the company of a lot of people who Pam is friends with, making it somewhat unavoidable to cut Pam completely out of our life. We also felt empathy for Pam, who said a stupid thing, but was also hurting secretly.

About six months ago we were invited to a party at Pam's house and decided to go. We knew it would hurt Sadie, so we got out ahead of it, and my wife had a conversation with her about how we were going to go, and that we hoped she wouldn't take this as us endorsing what Pam said. We wanted to go out and have a fun night with friends. After this, Sadie has cut us out of her life. My wife still invites her over and is pretty heartbroken about the whole thing, as they have been very close friends for a long time.

I want to have empathy for the situation, but I am sort of in the camp that we have done a lot for Sadie, and that not being able to forgive this and throwing away 15 years of friendship is extreme on her part. My wife is torn up about it and has been taking the whole thing pretty hard. She even went over to apologize and was told by Sadie that she wasn't standing up for her (even after all her efforts to mend the relationship between Pam and Sadie). So basically, AITA for going to this party against Sadie's wishes, and do we owe her an apology or were we in the right not to cut off an entire part of our friend group because of this disagreement between Sadie and Pam?"
amitheasshole,AITA for blowing up at my partner because they did something they couldn't control?,0,2025-05-01 19:03:41,15,"It's been a really long time since this happened, like years, but I'm thinking about it again and I'm starting to doubt if I was in the right here.

My partner (17NB at the time), who I'll call Onyx, and I (14F at the time) had started a relationship a year and a half ago.

The day this happened was one of the times I had gone over to their house to spend the night watching movies together and making TikToks.

Waking up the next morning, I saw Onyx wasn't in the room. I had left my meds on the counter, and when I went to go get them, I saw their phone light up like ten times in a row.

I, being the nosy girl I was, went ahead and took a quick glance at the messages, they were a long, cheesy paragraphs saying how much they loved Onyx.

I confronted them about it as soon as they came back, to which I expected them to say something like ""it's not what it looks like!"" (I was 14, cut me some slack) but they said something I wasn't expecting.

They said that one of the alters in their system was dating that person, so he had no idea. I didn't even know Onyx had DID, and I didn't know about DID at the time.

They told me they weren't cheating because it wasn't them who was doing it, it was their alter, Bug. Bug was with this person, not Onyx. I thought this was the biggest lie ever.

I told them that the name the message had said was Onyx, not Bug, but they let me know that the other person probably didn't know they had the disorder.

After all the arguing, I grabbed all my stuff and storming off dramatically, yelling ""whatever,"" ""I don't care,"" ""fuck you,"" and stuff. I told their parents I wasn't feeling good and that's why I was leaving early. I called my mom to come pick me up and when she asked why I was crying I couldn't tell her because she didn't know we were together.

I didn't answer any of their messages and went the other way when I saw them at school. I just wanted to shut them down about everything, even though communication is important in relationships.

Since then, I've done some research. But my issue with trying to look it up online is that I always get two different answers to my questions every time. One source will say ""yes"" and the other will say ""no"" so I don't know what's real and what's not.

From what I've read, people with DID don't know what their other alters are doing, so it actually was not their fault? But then again, the sources can be conflicting.

I gotta add that I have a suspicion that they didn't have DID and they were just lying to me, but that could just be my resentment and it's really gross of me to try and deny that someone has a disorder, I have no possible way of knowing. They didn't show any other symptoms or say anything beforehand.

I wish they would have told me before we got together. I probably would have taken it easier, but it's not like they were gonna know this would happen. It just feels like something that should be established before you start dating."
amitheasshole,AITA for not apologizing to my brother after I yelled at him for getting my ice cream order wrong?,609,2025-04-29 22:22:06,101,"A little over a week ago, my (21F) brother (23M) went out to celebrate a soccer win with friends. He didn‚Äôt tell our parents or me that he‚Äôd need a ride, so we assumed he‚Äôd get home on his own. Around 2:30am, he texted me asking for a ride. I was annoyed since I was trying to sleep, but he insisted there were no other options. I asked if I‚Äôd only be picking up him, and he said yes. Mind you, we live in a village so I had to drive 25 minuted to pick him up.

When I got there, my brother and five large, drunk soccer players piled into my small car that could BARELY fit 4 people, including me. I didn‚Äôt want to leave them stranded, so I drove them home. My brother didn‚Äôt thank me or even say anything afterward. I felt incredibly used.

The next day, Easter Sunday, my dad was heading out to pick up some ice cream (it's a tradition). My brother was writing down our picks for ice cream flavors, and I told him three times to write down raspberry as a backup in case my favorite wasn‚Äôt available. He nodded. Later, my dad came back and said my flavor was out, and my brother hadn‚Äôt told him what I wanted instead. When I got upset, he just shrugged and said he ‚Äúforgot.‚Äù

That evening, I was in the shower when my brother wanted in. He complained that I always used the bathroom at the wrong time. I snapped, telling him he wasn‚Äôt the one to decide what time was ""right"" for me to be in the bathroom and that he was being controlling and inconsiderate. He laughed and mocked me for being upset over ice cream. I told him it wasn‚Äôt about the ice cream. It was about how he never seems to care about me, my feelings or how his actions affect others. I told him I felt used and that he lacked emotional intelligence. He called me crazy and childish, so I walked out before I could burst into tears.

My dad heard the argument and agreed my brother was inconsiderate. My mom, however, said I shouldn‚Äôt expect men to understand my emotions and basically told me to just accept it.

Now, my brother is giving me the silent treatment and told my mom he might not want to go on our planned family trip to New Zealand because of me. My mom wants me to apologize or make the first move. I told her I‚Äôm not mad anymore but I will not do him any more favors, and I‚Äôm not apologizing for standing up for myself.

So, Reddit, AITA for not apologizing to my brother for yelling at him?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not watching film with my wife after I paid for it?,0,2025-05-01 20:06:34,30,"We went to see a movie, I won't name the film so as to not spoil anything but it is a scary film from what she tells me. The reason she tells me and not I know is because I left the film in the first 25 minutes -MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS: 20 seconds into the film I said I wanted to leave. I got up and went out to speak to someone and read a sign that said they offer subtitles on the first showing of the day. I returned to my seat with my wife and tried to make it further into the film but couldn't due to the distraction, I then went back out to the lobby RESUME MAIN POSTING: I got a refund and walked home. Before I left I told her I was leaving and she knew why and she decided to stay.

I left because there were subtitles. The place where we went to see it offers subtitles on the first showing of the day (we didn't know this). I don't mind subtitles if it is apart of the filmmaker's intent but in this case it was not, it's simply for persons who prefer that or need it, which I also don't mind but I don't need or want them. It distracts me from what I'm trying to do which is take in a filmmakers intent. Anyway, I leaned over, told her I was leaving and that I would find my a way home. She stayed and watched a scary film all by herself which she doesn't like to do. I got up went and spoke to management before I left and got passes for a different showing.

End of the story/very abbreviate version: She is very upset that I left her to watch a scary film, we both did not know it was scary going in AND also upset that I didn't tell her, via text or other communication route that I had passes to a future film if we wanted. She said I should have told her. I replied that I respected her opinion on the spot am not going back into a movie theater to have a conversation nor am I going to text her and that she could have always left with me. I didn't know she was waiting on me to text her, she is watching a movie, I'm not expecting her to leave, she could have left with me. She said she would have knowing that I did not waste the money and had passes for a future time

edit: formatting

So she wanted to be respectful of my purchase (money) and I wanted to be respectful of her decision to stay. AITA?

Last edit: Well, looks like I'm the asshole, thanks guys. Going to build the communication bridge with my wife about respecting out time together like we planned."
amitheasshole,WIBTA to give my manager my mom‚Äôs number to have my mom deal with my manager asking for a doctor‚Äôs note?,0,2025-05-01 16:48:21,25,"Hey so, pretty much the question doesn't need much explanation. I am typing this on my phone right now. I am 17 at the moment, working a part time job at an auto department store. I recently got sick and have been jumping from 100¬∞ to 103¬∞. I let the store manager know on wednesday I can not come into work on Friday or Saturday and will let them know when I am well enough, he told me to message the general manager about it as he is out of the country right now. So I did, I took a screenshot of the chat I sent to my store manager and sent it to the general manager with a quick explanation. She responded with she will cover my shift on Saturday and see me on Sunday? Which is fine I suppose however last time I got this sick I was out for almost 2 weeks. Then she texted me asking if I had a doctors note, so I responded with a photo of my fever on a thermometer next to my watch with the date and said ""not yet but i do have a date stamp next to my fever if that covers it."" I am pretty annoyed right now as I showed her previously my temperature and now she wants a doctors note. I have had problems with her previously going on power trips and dumping her work on me during shifts we work together and I honestly do not like her, but she's my manager so I have to be respectful. I know she will ask for a doctor's note if I can't come in on Sunday. And I am wondering if it would be a bad move to forward my mom or my dad's number and let her now to talk to them because I am sick at the moment. I am leaving this job at the end of May to transfer to a college this June and so I dont want to rock the boat more as my store manager has already offered to but in a transfer to a store where I am going so I still will have a job. That being said, I am still technically a minor and I feel like this is kind of invasive when I've shown enough proof and she still doesn't trust me. "
amitheasshole,AITA for getting extremely angry at my friend for making me wait 4.5 hours to play online with him?,0,2025-05-01 17:26:46,34,"My friend (debating on that right now) and I play online games together, our most frequent one is Destiny 2. We had planned to play today, but when I sent him the party invite, he said to ""Give me a bit"", to which I called him and asked what was going on, and he said he was doing a quest in Destiny 2 with someone else first, and shouldn't be too long. I was pretty miffed at this already, because it seemed like he ditched me for someone else.

  
I did something on my own, then called back 20 minutes later, and he said he wasnt done yet. At this point, I was getting really mad, so my dad took me out somewhere to have fun with him instead. It wasn't until I got home 4.5 hours later until my friend texted me that he was done. At this point when he joined my chat party, I yelled at him until my lungs almost burst because he wasted my afternoon and started making stupid excuses, and asked him why the fuck does he not EVER think before he says bullshit like ""Gimme a bit"" and then make me wait 4 hours. He then told me he had ADHD, and that he has difficulty with that.

  
I got even more angry, and then asked ""Does that stand for A Dreadfully Huge Douchebag?"" before leaving. 5 minutes later, his mother texted me and told me I really offended him by saying that. All I told her was that he should've thought about that before telling me to wait a bit and then making me wait hours, and that 4.5 hours is not a fucking bit.

Some backstory:
My entire life I‚Äôve been under serious control by my parents. I wasnt allowed a phone till recently, wasnt allowed to dress how i want, couldnt go out at all with friends (as a result im a loner), couldnt work, had no privacy. When i say ‚Äòno privacy‚Äô i really mean it. My parents go through my pockets, my phone, my bank statements, not even allowed to call people whilst im home. Its drained me mentally and I‚Äôve had times where I‚Äôve been so low that I have a breakdown. I get yelled at for the smallest of reasons. If i get into an argument with my other siblings, they all take eachothers side besides mine. My parents always say i should show respect n wtv, but i dont get how i dont?

I barely go out with my friends because they are so ""protective"" of me. I barely see my girlfriend nowadays because they actually told me they don't want me to get her pregnant. They are religious but it barely seems like it at all because of my dad keep calling me a little shit and my mother being a pervert thinking im going to fuck around. I have to ask to leave the house for a few things, like going to the movies, the bowling alley, or my friends house a week in advance to see them. Remind you that I'm 20 years old, my girlfriend said that her friends and her are going to corpus christi to the aquarium. She didn‚Äôt invite me because she knows the situation i am in, and she felt bad, so i asked my parents if i can go a month in advance. My mom said no faster than a bullet, and my dad said that he doesn‚Äôt want me to think with my ‚Äúlittle head‚Äù , saying im going to fuck my girlfriend. He called me a little shit and I live under his house so I live under his rules.¬†

I told him that i pay for ‚Äúmy portion of my house‚Äù because i gave them around 3,000 dollars in grant and loan funds from college, they wanted me to get a loan for college because i couldn‚Äôt pay for my first semester and the second one they just took it.

I want to get a job to move out of this place but they sold my car, and lied about me not being under the car insurance so i can‚Äôt drive. I was under the insurance for 6 fucking months before they told me the truth and even if i get a full time job while i do college i won‚Äôt have enough money to keep myself afloat. I thought about moving in with my girlfriend but I can't just put that kind of weight on her, and if i move out my family will actually banish me.¬†

amitheasshole,AITA for not visiting my mother after she locked me sick in her house.,5,2025-04-30 23:22:02,17,"

So, last weekend it was holiday in my country. The house arrangements are a tad bit confusing, but to put it simply, my mother lives in a neighbouring town, she is taking care of the Beelzebul vessel on Earth that is my grandma, it's a little ranch our family owns, she is retired so she likes it there because it keeps her occupied. I stayed in our house in the city I was born, my father never lived with us so I got the house to myself for college and stuff.

So as it is customary, if I don't have a reason to stay in our town, I go to visit her and stay there until I find an excuse to leave that damned place. But in the meantime a grotesque abscess forms inside my throat, hurting like a bitch.

Here's something I should have mentioned sooner, even before my mother moved out, I was always very individualistic, I hate big gatherings, I hate special dates should be celebrated for some reason (including my own fkg birthday), I hate receiving rides, all that jazz. So I just wanted to go to the hospital in our town, get some shots and make a nice roots soup in MY kitchen by MYSELF.

But she wouldn't let me, saying that ""Stay here, I know you, you won't even go to the hospital"" and the worst ""Mommy will take care of you"", there is nothing more infuriating to me than being treated like a child with fever that just needs enough cuddles and tea. I've been hospitalized by myself multiple times before, making sure to not let anyone know where I was so there would be no annoying visitors to treat me like I am some kind of dying dude.

So I brushed her off, like ""FUCK NO, that's what I am trying to escape."" She got a little bit sad but let it go, since I was two hours away from the nearest bus station and the only bus would pass in 1 hour, she knew I would never arrive there by foot on time. I swallowed my pride and asked for one of the family members a ride home, but she didn't allow it. I was by the definition of the word: locked.

Before continuing, I must be clear, me and my mother have very good relationship, we do not always see eye to eye, but we love each other sincerely. But let's just say we are too much alike, though unlike me she is way more sociable, I can't really tell who is the most prideful and impetuous among the two of us.

But here is the thing, what it bothered me is that she didn't keep me there for my benefit, she kept me there out of spite for me saying I was trying to escape her care.

So, post-holiday, she went with me to the specialized doctor in our town, making sure to speak on my behalf every time, though it hurt my throat singing, the wound on my pride was way more painful, being treated like a child was humiliating.

So here we are, she is calling me about visiting for the weekend, and I've been persistent that ""I won't go, not after you trapped me there."" Probably just for this weekend, she may have won, but good I will make her sweet victory taste as bitter as I can.

My husband responded that we will be out of town that week and his father replied ‚ÄúI thought we talked about this before, you said she and her sister could stay in the condo while you guys are at the wedding‚Äù.

amitheasshole,AITA for punishing my daughter for deleting her social media,0,2025-05-01 20:56:22,72,"I have a daughter 16f.

Almost 2 years ago on her 15th birthday I let her have social media which she's been begging to use with some very strict conditions. 

There were parental controls on the social media she couldn't use it at school or after 9pm and she couldn't use it for more than 2 hours per day. Now this doesn't apply to her screen time in general I don't give her a strict one now considering she's nearly 17 but her social media time is restricted. And she like hates these rules and complains about them all the time about how her ""freinds"" don't have any rules. I always told her it didn't matter what they did and these were our rules. She still complains about it time to time.


I told her that when she turns 17 I'll let her use social media till 10pm and for 3 hours during weekends. She got really mad and said they were incredibly restrictive. I told her that she can do what she wants when she moves out but until now these are her rules. 

Then she did something so incredibly shocking I never could have expected it in my wildest dreams. She said If I was going to keep putting these restrictions she'd just delete all the social media. I figured she was joking but no she actually did it. I was furious that she deleted it just like that because she disagreed with the rule. It also makes no sense doing so but regardless.

I figured that the only reason she'd be deleting it is if she wants to use it secretly to avoid any restrictions. So as punishment I took hee phone away and grounded her for a week. She swore she wasn't going to use social media secretly but I just didn't believe her because why else did she delete it. She said it was to prove a point but I'm pretty sure she's lying.

Ultimately I gave her a flip phone and said she won't get her smartphone back till her birthday and only if she admits she planned to use social media secretly.

My husband thinks I'm going too far and my daughter is still mad at me.

I meet the same group again and get recognized. More small talk. ""hey dude we're going to watch sport event xy somewhere why don't you join us?"" I am at this point slightly buzzed and sociable and agree to go with them. I'm getting positive feedback from one out of the group and another is friendly as well. Rest seems to be neutral but you don't give your CV to anyone you meet after all. So I start to walk with them a bit believing we'd end up in some sports bar drinking watching the game. On the way more small talk with person A. I confirm the approximate equal age of everyone involved so it's not some weird old dude with kids or anything like that. After a few minutes we come to a rather fancy restaurant and it's apparent they're going to eat there. At this point one of them takes me aside and blatantly tells me that they would like to be alone for that meal but ""maybe we see each other later you know"".

 So that‚Äôs why me and J planned to go together it was a mutual benefit thing. 

However recently J has been going through some things at home like negative things, and our schedules haven‚Äôt been aligning as a result. 

I asked J if we could make a game plan for Friday as I like a good schedule when it comes to big events, the only downside is they wanted to FaceTime and hash out a plan. I didn‚Äôt have time this entire week to face time, and when I did have time they were busy hanging out with their friends. I messaged them tonight when I was free asking if they were available to which I received no answer quite yet, but they had posted on Instagram 15 minutes ago. Not a huge deal I can‚Äôt force people to respond but if there is anonymosity or an issue that is not brought to my attention I don‚Äôt want it to hinder a big opportunity for me on Friday which is in 2 days.

So I talked to my other friend (R) who is going to the show and they offered to drive me up. I do trust R a little more to be punctual and to plan with me as they have before for other important events. 

This is where my question lies, am I the asshole for going behind J‚Äôs back in a way and going with another friend up? 

I plan to shoot them a text tomorrow to explain that the lack of response or plan has made me feel like I might be forcing them to do something they don‚Äôt want to or just that it might not work out, so I‚Äôm going to go up with another person and look forward to seeing them there. My fear however is J can sometimes become a little overly sensitive and can take things personal and respond with aggression instead of understanding atleast initially. I do not know for certain how they would respond but I do have a large fear it could hurt our relationship a little bit. 

Edit: J actually read my text as of 9:17z it is currently 10:38 no response "
amitheasshole,AITA for not accepting a scholarship offer from a school my dad wants me to go to.,15,2025-04-30 15:49:57,14,"For a brief backstory I‚Äôm 16 and my parents divorced when I was young and when it came to high school my parents insisted that I go where I want to. 

However I chose a well regarded school in my area where all my friends would be going and since I‚Äôve changed a lot. I‚Äôm no longer the quiet kid and I‚Äôm now a sporty guy doing cross country and athletics. I was recently offered a scholarship at a school my dad wanted to go to when he was my age but was forced to go elsewhere. I turned down the scholarship because the school is far from where I live and the only people I‚Äôd know there are some distant family friends and mostly because I‚Äôm very happy where I am. 

So Reddit I need to know AITA for not accepting a scholarship at a school that my dad wants me to go to

amitheasshole,AITA for expecting my friend to be a better friend before our huge two-month international trip?,0,2025-05-01 06:00:06,12,"Hey Reddit, this is my first time posting here so please go easy on me.

Some context: I (18M) planned a senior year trip to India, and spontaneously invited one of my friends, let‚Äôs call him Tim (also 18M), to come with me. We‚Äôve been friends for about 2 years, not super close at first, but our bond got stronger as the trip planning got more serious. This is going to be Tim‚Äôs¬†*first time traveling abroad*, and we‚Äôll be backpacking through India for two months‚ÄîMumbai, Sikkim, Kashmir, Goa, and more. Everything is booked for summer 2025, and I‚Äôve been incredibly excited.

Here‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs been bothering me: despite how big and life-changing this trip is, Tim still seems way more emotionally invested in his other friends than me. I get that he‚Äôs known them longer and that they‚Äôre all on the school swim team together, while Tim and I mostly bonded through this trip. But it hurts that our friendship still feels surface-level. We don‚Äôt talk about anything beyond India. Conversations feel forced. He barely opens up to me.

Recently, we went on a hike together, and it was actually a lot of fun. It felt like we were finally connecting. But then as soon as we got back to school, it was like nothing had changed. He slipped right back into his normal pattern of ignoring me, just like before. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve poured a lot into this friendship. I‚Äôm helping him navigate international travel, we‚Äôre staying with my family in India, I even taught him how to read and write in Hindi. I guess I thought this would bring us closer, but I still feel like just the ""trip friend.""

What really gets me is this one class period we share‚Äîeconomics. We sit together and have small talk, but it feels forced. Then the bell rings, he immediately finds his best friend (let‚Äôs call him Connor), and they walk off together. I‚Äôm just left there, awkward and alone. I mean‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm literally taking this guy on a once-in-a-lifetime trip across the world, and he won‚Äôt even give me the time of day at school?

It makes me wonder if he‚Äôs just using me for the experience. Like, he gets excited when I talk about the food or travel, or when he comes over to my house and gets hyped about Indian food being ‚Äúexotic,‚Äù but that‚Äôs it. I get crumbs of attention, and I cling to them because I¬†*want*¬†to be closer to him. But then he pulls away again, and I feel stupid for caring.

Here‚Äôs the thing, though: Sometimes he does this same ignoring behavior with his other friends, but it‚Äôs less common. He‚Äôs joked about being on the autism spectrum, and maybe that‚Äôs part of it? I‚Äôm not sure, but it makes me wonder if that‚Äôs just how he is.

So Reddit‚Ä¶ AITA for wanting more out of this friendship, especially considering everything I‚Äôm doing for him? Or am I just being too emotionally needy?

EDIT 1: To everyone in the comments, I AGREE. Relationships don‚Äôt work that way, and I can see that more clearly now. I think some of this might come from unresolved trauma I faced during childhood. I had an abusive stepfather, and growing up, I often tried to earn love and validation through material or achievement-based means‚Äîlike getting good grades to please my strict Asian parents.

Even now, my mom sometimes reminds me how much she spends on my education as a reason I should love her or be grateful. I know she cares about me, and my stepfather is thankfully out of the picture, but I think that upbringing might have shaped my tendency to link effort, money, or ‚Äúdoing things for people‚Äù with emotional closeness. It‚Äôs probably why I feel so hurt when I invest so much in a friendship‚Äîlike this trip‚Äîand don‚Äôt get the emotional response I hoped for. Maybe that‚Äôs where my more needy or materialistic tendencies in relationships come from.

  
EDIT 2: For those asking why I chose Tim for the trip instead of someone I was closer with‚Äîwell, I actually¬†*did*¬†originally ask someone else. My best friend, let‚Äôs call him Aamir, was supposed to come. We‚Äôve been friends for around seven years, and even though he doesn‚Äôt go to my school, we‚Äôre extremely close. But unfortunately, Aamir is Pakistani, and his visa for India was outright denied. That was heartbreaking because I really wanted to share my culture with someone who meant a lot to me, and to someone it would be less foreign to. 

At school, I don‚Äôt have many¬†*close*¬†friends, so Tim felt like the best option. It wasn‚Äôt like I was forced to ask someone‚ÄîI genuinely wanted to bring a friend along who I could share this adventure and culture with. Tim seemed like a great fit. He‚Äôs shown real interest: he learned some Hindi, he eats Indian food at my house, he enjoys watching Bollywood movies with me. I thought that energy would naturally carry into school life too.

But that‚Äôs where I feel let down. Outside of school, he‚Äôs engaged and enthusiastic. But at school, I feel like a backup friend‚Äîlike I only matter when it‚Äôs convenient or ‚Äúexotic.‚Äù I just wish that same fun, open energy existed in our day-to-day life, not just when we‚Äôre watching movies or eating biryani."
amitheasshole,AITA for not offering my condolences for the death of a family member's pet,0,2025-05-01 14:42:00,21,"Throwaway account because I've family and friends who know my main. So I (F30s) have a family member (F50s) who I'll initial FM, whose cat passed this afternoon. The cat was an old girl and was suffering from general age-related issues so they put her down, and FM posted this into our family chat. Others offered their condolences and FM's daughter, my cousin who grew up with this cat, was devastated so I messaged her directly to offer my condolences.

Here's the thing. I actually lived with FM and her family for about 1 year before I decided to move out not that long ago. FM was abusive - a typical vulnerable narcissist who constantly lied and manipulated, and had quite a nasty mouth on her. She would talk about me to others and spread weird lies which ended up getting back to me but I never confronted her because she was unpredictable and aggressive with a tendency to do things like slam doors and objects. She made my life misery for the year I lived there as I wasn't in the best mental state to begin with (which is how I ended up living there) and I ended up going through another crisis being briefly sectioned around halfway through being there. And I've found out recently she's still spreading lies about me.

Now I understand the death of a pet is devastating because they're members of your family, but since I moved out I blocked all forms of contact with FM, including her number. I saw her message because WhatsApp doesn't block them if you're in a group chat together. I've not directly said anything to FM, only her daughter (my cousin), and I don't particularly want to offer my condolences to FM. Especially as when another family member's pet passed last year, FM was foul in speaking about it stating ""she needs to get over it now, it's just a dog"". So AITA for not saying anything? Am I being petty?"
amitheasshole,AITA for for spending vacation funds?,0,2025-05-01 17:07:06,44,"Hi everyone,

My (38M) wife (37F) have been together for a decade now.

Recently, she came out as polyamorous after some long discussions with her friends who convinced her to try opening up the marriage in order to live a more free and authentic life (as they said). Recently, she got a new boyfriend (42M) and they planned to go on a trip to Morocco. I've been putting money aside for their trip but I'm not invited because her bf doesn't want me there.

I thought that since I was the one funding the trip but wouldn't be able to go, I could maybe treat myself to pre-orderint a Nintendo Switch 2. They go on vacation in June when the Switch 2 releases so it makes for a great opportunity to get some gaming sessions in whilst they're gone.

However, my wife's boyfriend exploded at me saying that all the funds were meant to be for their journey. My wife is also very upset at me and said I was being inconsiderate to her needs. I tried explaining there's more than enough money so I thought it would be fine but I didn't ask them if this was okay prior to putting the preorder in.

I've taken into consideration what they said, and maybe I was acting out of order. I've been considering cancelling the preorder and getting a refund but I wanted to get some perspective on here to see if the three of us could reach a resolution.

AITA"
amitheasshole,AITA For not helping my sister after she ignored my feelings,8,2025-04-30 18:19:31,5,"I‚Äôm 25, FM. I‚Äôm the black sheep of the family, but I‚Äôm also the one who helps everyone when they‚Äôre in need, even though no one helps me. 

Anywho, my sister is 26 with 2 kids. She‚Äôs probably the worst sibling I have, but I connected with her because of my niece and nephew. I drive for Spark for a living, and I make decent money as long as I can work. My sister worked for the hospital before she decided to up and move back to our hometown, even though I told her it would not be good for her there. So she moved, didn‚Äôt have a job, lost her car, and she was this way for a year straight. 

I started taking care of them, like feeding them every day, buying Halloween costumes, gifts, birthday presents, and getting them rides‚Äîlike genuinely taking care of my sister as if she‚Äôs my fianc√©e. 

So tax time rolled around, and my sister owes the IRS a balance, so she can‚Äôt file her kids. She asked me to file them, and she would pay me. Me being the person I am, I told her I didn‚Äôt want a dime, and I just wanted to get her a car and buy the kids something nice. So she does that, and now she‚Äôs back working and kind of in a good space, but she still texts me for money every day. 

So, recently, I got into a car accident, and the driver didn‚Äôt have insurance, and I only had liability at the time. So now my car's down, meaning I can‚Äôt work and make money until it‚Äôs fixed or until I get a rental. Me being 25, Turo wants to charge me a deposit, and my sister says I can use my car so they don‚Äôt charge me a deposit because I‚Äôm 26. Okay, fine. I get the rental car, and everything‚Äôs going fine. Then I get news that both of my close cousins just got killed‚Äîon my dad's side, not my mom's‚Äîbecause she‚Äôs my sister on my mom's side. I get really deeply depressed, and I text her to try to tell her that I‚Äôm not okay and that I feel like I‚Äôm starting to feel unlivable again because I‚Äôve been this way since I was a kid. 

She texts me back and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to come get that car because you‚Äôre talking about feeling unlivable, and that car‚Äôs in my name, you stupid slow [expletive].‚Äù 

Okay, now all the grief I was feeling quickly turns into anger, but I‚Äôm still being sensible. I say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it back right now.‚Äù She tells me, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm coming to get it,‚Äù so I left it in the Walmart parking lot and put the key under the seat. I sent her the location and walked back to my car, which was a one hour and forty-five minute walk. My car started up enough to get me around until today when it broke down. 

So, my sister texts me and says, ‚ÄúYeah, bring that car back.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúNo. When I tried to, you insisted on coming to get it.‚Äù My mom tells me I‚Äôm wrong, but I personally don‚Äôt think I am. So, AITA?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I asked my MIL to show me her dress for our wedding events?,89,2025-04-30 04:25:47,72,"I am getting married this July. We are having a fusion wedding (I am Indian; he is American). His parents are graciously paying for our wedding (they are wealthy). 

I generally have a great relationship with his mother, although she does suffer from ‚Äúmain character energy‚Äù - she likes to be the center of conversation. We let her, largely because she is funding the vacations and dinners we have with her. My husband‚Äôs siblings have complained that at their weddings she has dressed too extravagantly - more so than the bride or what befits the occasion. There is no risk of that at our wedding as indian brides are hard to beat. 

At the same time, I have shown her my outfits for the wedding excitedly but she is refusing to ‚Äúreveal‚Äù her outfits for either of the 2 events to anyone. She is having a custom outfit made for the wedding. For the welcome party, my DIL revealed she‚Äôs wearing something crazy and ‚Äúshiny‚Äù but wasn‚Äôt allowed to say more. 
I haven‚Äôt pressed her too much, but have asked her lightly and been refused. 


This isn‚Äôt a big deal to me, but it‚Äôs also strange that what she‚Äôs wearing is the big surprise for my wedding. For the welcome party, it would be easier to outshine me as I‚Äôm wearing a more minimal outfit. I would like to press her a bit more firmly but don‚Äôt want to be rude. "

She will excuse herself to go talk to him for hours on the phone so plans and activities are put on hold until she is done. We don‚Äôt want to leave her out so we just wait. So last Saturday we went to the beach and she decided to call her bf on the beach and it got into a fight so we just sat there on the beach in silence while they were fighting. It‚Äôs so annoying. Then one of D‚Äôs friends invited us to a party me and D were so down but L didn‚Äôt want to go because of her relationship. She told us tho that her bf doesn‚Äôt have a problem with her going to a party but she doesn‚Äôt want to. So we stayed home. We do what she wants to. Even with music in the car. When I am driving she has the aux and I will ask her to play another song and she will say no but when I have the aux she just grabs my phone and chooses the next song it‚Äôs so weird. If she doesn‚Äôt want to do something she won‚Äôt compromise at all. Today she is upset because her boyfriend wants to surprise his mother. Deadass she doesn‚Äôt want him to visit his mom without her. Apparently his mom dislikes her so she wants him to put distance between him and his mom.

amitheasshole,AITA for letting my sister hold my baby against our mother's wishes?,9318,2025-04-29 03:36:11,975,"I (29M) have a newborn baby. My 9 year old sister - whom we'll call Kylie for privacy purposes, has been *so* excited to be an aunt for the first time. 


Kylie has a physical disability, she struggles with fine motor tasks - and has a slight tremor in her hands when holding objects. Because of this, our mother stated that she did not want Kylie to hold the baby - ever. She kept saying how K's ""hands can't be trusted"" and that it would be best if she just looked at the baby. 


But K was so excited to meet her new niece that I decided it was worth trying. With some assistance from me, she was able to hold her without issue. When our mother saw it happening, she was not happy. She said that it was irresponsible of me and repeated that Kylie's ""hands can't be trusted"" around the baby. She started talking about how when she says ""no"" as a parent, I need to respect that. 



AITA for letting my sister hold my baby, against our mother's wishes? "
amitheasshole,AITA for not saying something to my friend's face?,3,2025-04-30 21:52:02,6,"There are 5 people involved in this incident. I will refer to myself as I, and the others as M, G, H, and O.

We were sat together and H was talking about things that annoyed her and she mentioned how she didn't like when people would just scroll on their phones while everyone else is having a conversation. M was not with us when she said this. However, we mention that M does this very often and we found it a bit annoying and disrespectful. Sometimes we would ask her opinion on a topic, only for her to have no idea what we were even talking about as she was focused on her phone instead. We didn't just mention her, though. I was mentioned too as I use my phone often as well, but I still actively partake in the conversations while doing so. Then G spoke up as ""the devil's advocate"" and said that not everyone is always in the mood to talk. Everyone agreed and the conversation moved on. 

The next day, M acts weird. She's not on her phone at all, and says things along the lines of ""Oh I'm not using my phone because I'm just on it all the time!"" (sarcastically). At this point I realise someone must have told her. When M is not here, I ask the group. G said she told her. later that day M messages H horrible messages along the lines of ""why couldn't you say it to my face, you're so fake.""(This is very ironic as M always loved saying that if people have an issue with her,they should say it to her face,and yet when she would talk bad about others,including about people in our group, she wouldn't ever dare say it to their face.)

The next day, M and G are not sat with us. O sent a very lengthy apology to her which M did acknowledge. O was most upset about this situation as she was closest to M and felt bad for saying things about her behind her back. We tried to comfort her and explained to her that what we said wasn't said in a harsh way but rather what we had observed, and we agreed on the fact that people aren't always in the mood to talk so she's not in the wrong. She then told us that what she is most angry about is that G herself had complained about M's constant use of her phone in the past yet now was acting like a good friend for telling her that we had said things about her behind her back. We agreed.

Fast forward a few days and M starts reposting videos on tiktok. They were videos along the lines of ""when your friends turn out to be fake/it's always the ones you least expect."" She also post things about only having 1 true friend (referring to G), which is ironic as she has said bad things about her.

It's been about a month since this incident. The remaining 3 of us have moved on. M seemingly hasn't as she still reposts videos relating to this. M and G have removed us on all social apps. O still feels bad about the incident. M and G still sit together, but don't really talk to each other and use their phones instead.

Were we the AH for not telling M straight up to her face about how we didn't like her constantly being on her phone?"
amitheasshole,"WIBTA if I refuse to attend my SIL's wedding, because I have plans for the date?",5,2025-04-30 19:32:49,61,"Me (28m) and my fianc√©e, Alex (25f) are huge fans of Pol'and'Rock festival - a music fest with all genres of music, interviews with some local celebrities and countless activities. I've been attending almost every year for 10 years, and she's been there 2 times. For three consecutive editions, we've camped with our friends from all over Poland and since all of us have our own lives, we get to see them only at the festival. Of course, we keep in touch with each other online, but you all know it's not even close to meeting irl. We've grown to love our camp like it's our family and miss them all the time. Of course, each year we make plans for a following edition: who brings what, where do we set our camp etc. We know we'll meet there next year.

Alex has a sister, Jane (27f). Their relationship is somewhat okay-ish. When they were children, Jane was a little bit of trouble-maker and attention seeker, while Alex was more of a quiet girl, sitting in her room and studying. Not that Alex didn't want any attention - she was pushed away by Jane when she was trying to initiate some time together or join her and her friends, and when they shared a room, Jane was verbally agressive towards Alex. This behavior and their mom (46f), who didn't pay any attention to Alex (since she ""didn't need any, because she's in her room all the time""), scarred Alex and was among the reasons she developed a borderline disorder. After my fiance√© moved out, they didn't keep in touch except for family gatherings and that hasn't changed to this day.

Jane met a guy in late 2023. In may 2024, she found out she's pregnant. The guy, Greg (30m) proposed, they bought an apartament together and in january, Jane gave birth to their son. They've been planning to get married before Jane's due date, but they couldn't find a place for a reception in time.

Today, Jane wrote to Alex to ask if we'll be going back from our trip (that we're currently on) this weekend, and if we are, if we can come by to their place, so J can personally give us a wedding invitation. In the message, she mentioned the date of the wedding: 2nd of August.

Here's the thing: Pol'and'Rock fest starts 31.07 at 15:00 and ends 03.08 at 3:00 (or for my eagle-hearted friends, 07/31 3PM - 08/03 3AM). Since the last edition ended, we've been planning to attend the festival from start to finish. I know it's ""just one day to skip"" and all, but still, it came out of the blue and neither I, nor A want to change our plans, especially since it's going to be logistically difficult (traffic, packing, hygiene etc.). Besides, cutting the time at the festival short would also mean cutting a day of seeing our friends, who we're really looking forward to see and spend time with. On the other hand, since it's close family's wedding, we might turn out to be huge jackasses if we skip it.

WIBTA if we refuse to change our plans that we've been making for over a year and skip my fiancee's sister's wedding?"

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my roommates I was done following his rules?,608,2025-04-29 15:52:07,784,"So I (23M) moved across the country in January to start grad school. I grew up with a single dad and four brothers‚Äîall athletes‚Äîso our house was very casual. Think shirts optional, lounging in boxers, locker room energy 24/7.

My roommate (also 23M) and I met through a school Facebook group. We seemed like a good fit‚Äîmorning people, into fitness, both social, etc. When we moved in, I didn‚Äôt think twice about hanging out in my boxers that first night while we played video games. He didn‚Äôt say anything then, but the next day he asked if I could be more covered up since he wasn‚Äôt used to that kind of living setup.

Fair enough‚ÄîI adjusted. No more boxers-only lounging, and I‚Äôve kept it respectful when we‚Äôre both around. But over the months, he‚Äôs started adding more and more ‚Äúrules‚Äù about what I can wear at home, and it‚Äôs starting to get to me. Some examples:

1. He has earlier classes, so sometimes I wait in the living room in my underwear while he finishes up in the bathroom. I‚Äôm there maybe 30 seconds, and I don‚Äôt see the big deal.

2. I run shirtless in 2 inch running shorts. Afterward, I usually eat quickly before showering. He told me it‚Äôs not about sweat‚Äîhe just doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsee all that.‚Äù Again, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs excessive.

3. I sometimes work out in my underwear in the living room when he‚Äôs not home. If he unexpectedly gets back early, I don‚Äôt stop mid-set, which he‚Äôs complained about.

4. Occasionally I‚Äôll pop out of my room briefly to grab something while not fully dressed. He says it ‚Äúbreaks the rule,‚Äù but I‚Äôm in and out in under a minute.

5. Once, I came out quickly to grab food not realizing he had two friends over. I ended up talking to them for a bit, still not fully dressed. No one else seemed to care, but he was really upset after.

When we hang out together in the living room, I always wear at least shorts and an undershirt. I‚Äôve made compromises. But recently he told me I need to ‚Äúrespect the rules‚Äù more. That‚Äôs when I finally told him I‚Äôve tried, but this isn‚Äôt a dictatorship. I‚Äôm not being reckless‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt think I need to be fully dressed every second at home.

Now he‚Äôs venting to our mutual friends and making it seem like I‚Äôm wildly inappropriate. I feel like I‚Äôve made a real effort to meet him halfway, and I‚Äôm not going to live under a dress code in my own apartment.

EDIT: Girlfriend told me to clarify that the underwear I've been wearing is a mixture of boxers/boxer briefs/the occasional tighty whities.  "

Everything was fine until we started talking nerd stuff and for almost 2 months we had it pretty good an we became quite close to each other almost in relationship. but suddenly he felt like a different person. he became extremely depressed and openly talked about how he always failed and how he was always bad at everything. me and my roommate 16 felt really bad about it. she knew him before when they had studied at their previous school together and she knew that he was depressed. it just got worse and worse and we started to feel irritated, tired of his constant whining and we felt the constant need to be some kind of therapist for him. I also started to put some realism into everything as we were close to becoming something and we lived in the same boarding school, same freind group and class so I thought that the two of us in a relationship will always be guaranteed to be just shit and mistakes. I explained all this to him and he actually seemed completely okay with it. but after a while he went into winter depression and hasn't left it yet. He isolates himself, only plays games in class and is close to failing subjects, teachers need to be a constant cheerleader for him to do work. I have said this a few times and he is not happy, for example when I ask if he should do something in a group project and he storms out of the classroom. He has also left class in anger when the teacher has asked him to be in class instead of on his screen. Some of my friends think I should show more empathy but I myself am so irritated when we eat dinner when we are a group of friends and we cook together he stares at his phone, doesn't help much with food and his constant anxiety just makes me so irritated. I can understand that people want me to show more empathy but it doesn't work because I just get frustrated.

My husband has a higher paying job than mine and it doesn't really bother me because I love what I do but he does lack interest in my work because of it. The first iffy thing was when we were getting ready, he gave me a ""check"" or something like that where he gave me the run down of dinner etiquette. I know dinner etiquette, my parents used to host this kind of dinners all the time, so yeah, I know how to act and how to behave. All his co-workers were going to the dinner and they brought their wives with them so it was pretty packed. Dinner was nice until we were in the dessert portions my husband's coworkers started talking about their wives and their hobbies. My husband brought up my ""hobbie"", I'm a journalist, and I write stuff once in a while. He talked about some of the stuff I've written, describing it as ""silly"". I didn't say anything and smiled awkwardly but he just kept going, saying he doesn't read my stuff because he ""doesn't want to be all up in my head"".

When we got home I talked to him about the jokes and said I didn't find them funny, but rather somewhat offensive and disrespectful towards my work. He told me to learn how to take a joke, I tried to ignore it so I just kept doing my thing, but then he started getting handsy and I rejected his advances because I was still sour about dinner and he got upset, so we went on and on about the dinner thing. I wasn't even adressing him making fun of me, I was generally upset over the hobby thing, because it's not a hobby, it's my line of work which I love and am very passionate about. He admitted to maybe being in the wrong for the jokes but that they were ""based on fact"". I grew up significantly welthier than him, I do not leech off of my parents, nor do they send me money out of free will. My parents have never said or done anything to make him feel inferior and they get along very well. We met when I was of going through some sort of hippie phase. I wasn't talking to my parents and I did not get along well with them at the time. I was some manic pixie dream girl at the time and I think he got wayyy to attached to that version of me (I was 25, I'm 32.) . He called me dull and compared me to my mom which isn't bad in it of its self but he said it as an insult and said I was becoming a suburban mom (we have a son, he's two).

I feel like he doesn't really appreciate me as a person or care about me as much as a husband should for his wife. I get what he's saying, but I'm getting older, I'm a mom and I'm advancing in my career and have a lot on my plate apart from that. I do love my husband, I married and started a family with him for a reason but maybe I took the joke too seriously? I'm not sure if I blew it too out of proportion because I asked friends and they said that maybe I took too seriously etc etc

AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for wanting my husband to study for his ASVAB instead of relying on his recruiter helping him cheat?,120,2025-04-29 23:43:03,172,"I (23F) am a stay-at-home mom to our 3-year-old daughter. My husband (25M) and I got married in 2021, separated for about a year and a half, and recently got back together. Right now, he‚Äôs our only source of income, and we‚Äôre struggling financially. He recently decided to join the Marine Corps with his brother, and honestly, this opportunity could really change our lives.

The issue is that he‚Äôs not taking it seriously. When he first took the ASVAB practice test, he scored a 4 or 6, very low. After that, I stepped in and helped him study, and with that effort, he brought his score up to a 15 on the real test. That‚Äôs still not a passing score (you need at least a 20), but it showed real progress.

Now, he‚Äôs eligible to retake the test, and I‚Äôve been urging him to study again so he can finally pass. But he just keeps putting it off, saying he‚Äôll ‚Äústart tomorrow,‚Äù and two weeks went by with no effort. When I finally pushed him on it, he told me his recruiter said he could just bring his phone into the test and cheat if he needed to.

I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs true, but the idea completely bothers me. First, because as a Christian and just as a person, I don‚Äôt believe cheating is the right way to do anything, especially something this important. Second, I‚Äôm terrified of the consequences if he gets caught. Isn‚Äôt that automatic disqualification? We‚Äôre depending on this. He sold his car, mine broke down, and he‚Äôs barely making anything at an under-the-table job. We‚Äôre out of options, and I‚Äôm honestly scared we won‚Äôt have a home in a couple months if this doesn‚Äôt work out.

When I try to talk to him about this, he gets angry with me and acts like I‚Äôm overreacting or don‚Äôt believe in him. But I do believe in him! I just want him to actually try. He has a history of taking shortcuts. He barely graduated high school because he cheated a lot and was treated like a star athlete. But this is real life now. There‚Äôs so much at stake.

So, AITA for insisting he study and not take a risky shortcut, even though he swears he has it ‚Äúhandled‚Äù?

Update to My Post From Yesterday ‚Äì Thank You & Some Clarifications

Hey everyone, first off, thank you so much for all the comments, feedback, and support. I‚Äôve read most of them and really appreciate the different perspectives. I wanted to hop back on and clear a few things up since there were a lot of assumptions and questions.

For those telling me to ‚Äújust get a job‚Äù I‚Äôve always worked. The only time I haven‚Äôt was during and shortly after my pregnancy. Most recently, I was working in management at a roofing company making decent money. Unfortunately, I had to quit about 6 weeks ago due to ongoing medical issues that made it impossible to continue in that role. I‚Äôll be the first to admit quitting without another job lined up wasn‚Äôt ideal, and I always advise others against it‚Äîbut I had to prioritize my health.

At the time, we were doing okay. I had a small amount in savings and my husband was working. But things unraveled quickly: He sold his car (he said he wouldn‚Äôt need it anymore because he was going into the military), My car broke down (after replacing two tires), which meant he couldn‚Äôt get to work anymore, he ended up taking under-the-table work with my friend‚Äôs dad, who‚Äôs been kind enough to pick him up and drop him off daily.

Before I started job hunting, my daughter was still in preschool, but once our situation got tight, I pulled her out to save money. It costs $298/week, and right now, that‚Äôs just not possible.

So currently: We have no transportation, I have no reliable family support (unfortunately, most of my family struggles with addiction), I‚Äôm still actively job hunting every day, but without a car and with my daughter at home full-time, my options are very limited.

I‚Äôve also been looking into remote/work-from-home jobs, especially anything flexible or that might allow me to care for my daughter while working. No luck yet, but I‚Äôm trying.

To those saying we won‚Äôt get military housing until my husband completes basic, yes, I‚Äôm aware. I‚Äôve spoken directly with his recruiters. Since we‚Äôre already married and have a child, he will start receiving pay at the end of his first week of basic. That income alone would be enough to help get us back on our feet or at least keep the rent paid and food on the table.

Also, everyone keeps asking how he scored so low. I. Do. Not. Know. And to those who are saying I should go in. I would. I 1000% would but I want to raise my daughter. It‚Äôs in my daughter‚Äòs best interest that I am the parent she‚Äôs primarily with, and who is primarily educating her and teaching her.

And lastly, I do not want him working under the table, I do not agree with it, I believe in paying my taxes. But right now that is the only option we have to keep food in my daughter‚Äòs stomach and a roof over her head."
amitheasshole,AITA for asking for allergies test for my safety,0,2025-05-01 05:03:05,30,I am M14 and I am allergic to pork I only found this out in December when one day I had some pork and few hours later I had reaction but I couldn't narrow it down what was but the next day Japan (I was there for holiday) I ate some pork ramen and had small reaction to it so it was confirmed I was allergic to pork but this was speculation and I didn't if this was true but just week after I asked my parents for allergies test when we get back from Japan but my mom went balastic and shouted at me said you don't need this (btw she always wanted me to never eat pork but I don't think affect this). But my brother and my dad agreed with saying it safer but my mom controls the whole family (lol) decisions. So for 5 months I never got allergic test. But I think she has crossed a line even though I tell her I am not going to any place with pork but just last weekend she took me to place that servers pork and she didn't tell me. If you are asking how I didn't know it was because I knew what wanted since been there a lot of time but that was in November of last year. So I thought they didn't serve pork but they did lucky my parents didn't order anything pork as the place that serves pork is expensive. But the dim sum that ate could had pork. But as I type this I am in another restaurant that serves pork and my mom knew and I said also it but she still wanted to eat here so we did. I am sick tired of this you know she always blames for not being able to eat at porky restaurant which hurts really bad because if I said this she would be mad given cold treatment. So I am the AITA 
amitheasshole,WIBTA For telling my sister-in-law to start parenting her child better while they live with us?,611,2025-04-29 14:28:57,93,"I (30M) live with my wife (30F) and daughter (7 Months) in a smallish 3 bedroom one bathroom house.

Back in November 2024, my sister-in-law(28F) and her daughter (7) made the decision to move to the city where my wife and I live.

I spoke with my wife about SIL staying with us and a family friend of ours, until she finds a home of her own, splitting her time here between our place and our friends place.

SIL moved in around Christmas and well it has been difficult, she has only spent one week with the friend (SIL actually messaged my wife the first night she stayed with friend asking if she can come back to our place.). SIL has been to maybe 10 house viewings and applied for all of them, while the rental market is also rough at the moment here and its hard to find a place (Wife and I got our new rental within a week of having to move out.), SIL rarely seems to actively be looking for a place to live. Often its my wife pushing SIL to go to viewings and apply for rentals.

All this was half expected between my wife and I, but what I was not expecting was her laziness with her own daughter. SIL will basically tell her daughter to do something about 5 times or so, before yelling or screaming at the child in frustration. This is because SIL will tell the daughter to do something and then go back to scrolling on her phone and not pay attention. For example, the daughter will watch Netflix on the iPad with her headphones on when it is dinner time. So the daughter will actually just sit watching whatever show she is watching and not eat unless told to. Sometimes the daughter will do something she shouldn't, like kicking the drawers to our babies clothing drawers (The daughter sleeps on a mattress in the babies room while bub sleeps with my wife and I.). SIL will yell at her to stop from the lounge room, 2 minutes later i will hear the kicking start again and SIL won't say anything for another 2-3 minutes.

To make things worse, SIL had been told they were approved for a rental and once the bond was provided, they could move in. Unfortunately they missed out because they didn't get the bond in time for the house. But i found out that she is getting $1700 a fortnight! (She is unemployed on government assistance) She has lived with us for 3 months, has not been charged board, only paid $200 for food and water a fortnight, yet somehow she couldn't save up for the bond and wanted to go through the governments bond assistance.

My wife and I are going to sit her down to discuss a budget with her and board, but based on these last 3 months, it feels like she is going to live here longer. As it is, My wife and I are the ones telling the daughter not to do things and I can see SIL get annoyed when we do.

Its a lot going on but I mostly don't know if me telling her to pull her finger out and parent her daughter better is out of line or not.

So reddit WIBTA it I told my SIL to parent her daughter better so my wife and I don't?  
Edit: SIL's daughter is 7."
amitheasshole,AITA for not looking back when my friend left?,70,2025-04-30 02:15:29,31,"Ok so basically I was on a bike ride with all my friends to relive some stress from school.

suddenly my friend silently leaves us without us knowing and starts taking a different path. We all respond to this by not stopping because it was his decision not to follow us.

 Then when he finally caught up to us he starts called me a fake friend for not stopping or calling him and completely ignores everybody else who did the exact same thing.

When we go a little farther he tells everyone that I should be apologizing which I do( I wish u didn‚Äôt). Even after all of this he still fuming and just talking to my other friend about god knows

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my neighbor to keep his dog under better control,223,2025-04-29 19:50:04,71,"We have a GSD that gets daily walks. My husband had him ready to go on a walk this afternoon before a potential thunderstorm came through. Most days, he's walked in the evening. 

They were in the driveway and he saw a neighbor with a reactive dog (maybe Irish Setter cross?) that is walked daily on a retractable leash was coming down the sidewalk. They backed up to be far away from the sidewalk for their passage. Somehow, the guys dog spots our dog and, being on a retractable leash, easily pulls out of the guys hand and comes to attack our dog.

My husband managed to grab the other dog by the collar and hold it away from our dog, while holding our dog on his harness at the end of his arm. Neighbors thankfully witnessed and help hold the other dog and the other dogs owner comes running up to get him.

The guy took the dog home and my husband, after us checking out our dog for injuries, goes on the promised walk. The guy just came to the door, giving me his phone number and saying he wants my husband to call him whenever we go for a walk. And that we ""shouldn't walk this time of the day"" because they ""always do."" I told the guy to stop using a retractable leash and get control of his dog better. He gives me a sob story about being disabled and not able to pick up poo and keep control of his dog and I shut him down because I also am and if the husband can't take the dog for a walk, I go only at times I know no one will be out because I know if a dog comes running up to us, I can't defend us well (which has happened more than once). My final advice to him was to get a dog walker if he can't control his dog after it poops.

We knew this dog was reactive because when we've been in our yard with our dog and the guy and his dog passed by, his dog would bark and rear up on his hind legs to try to pull into our driveway and into our yard. 

After recounting the story to a ""friend,"" I was told that I'm being the ass for not being sympathetic to his ""injuries"" he said he had (ring camera shows it would have been not from our dog, because the neighbor had the dog 15 feet away from ours by the time he arrived) and not agreeing immediately to not walk our dog in the afternoon?"
amitheasshole,AITA for crying and saying that all my effort had gone to shit?,0,2025-05-01 11:30:25,14,"
I (F16) had something happen a few weeks ago that I'm still thinking about. In English class, we were assigned to do a project about our idol. I chose to talk about one of my favorite singers because she has overcome many difficulties in her life, shares inspiring messages in her songs, and is also an immigrant like me.

I got so excited about this project that I spent hours researching and putting together a super cute and aesthetic presentation. I dedicated so much time and effort to it.

When presentation day arrived, I was super enthusiastic. At one point, I played one of the artist's first songs and a classmate stood up, started dancing, and then asked me if she could continue dancing. I said yes (now I think I should have said no, but I didn't want to look bad).

The worst came after: while I was presenting, several classmates wouldn't stop interrupting with comments. Each interruption made me lose my train of thought and I had to pick up from where I left off. I reached a point where I got so frustrated that I started crying and blurted out that ""all my work had gone to shit."" I probably could have saved myself from crying but I was so overwhelmed and frustrated that I couldn't hold it in.

The teacher didn't like at all that I used those swear words and got a bit upset.

In the end, I couldn't finish the presentation, and the teacher started saying it was my fault for making it too long. Yes, it was long, but that doesn't justify my classmates' disrespect. There are much more dense subjects where nobody interrupts, and when they did their presentations, I always respected them.

I don't remember exactly all the comments, but I think some were about the singer and her physical appearance (typical of some boys üôÑ).

Maybe I'm partly to blame for getting too excited and making such a detailed presentation. I could have summarized the biography or not included songs from each album (although I did it to make it more dynamic and show the artist's evolution). But my class is also at fault for not knowing how to be respectful, and the teacher for not setting limits when she should have.

What also bothers me is that several classmates who put in just a fraction of the effort I did got good grades. I mean, I'm not saying they don't deserve good grades, but I wish I had known that before so I wouldn't have wasted so much time.

My family is divided: some say it was my fault for making the presentation too long, others say it's my classmates' fault for being disrespectful... and I don't even know what to think anymore. I also don't want to seem like I'm being difficult by justifying why my presentation was so extensive.

So, Reddit Aita?

amitheasshole,WIBTA for saying no to fireworks to spite my mom?,7,2025-04-30 18:06:24,42,"My(28F) mom (71F) is upset that Im not letting her participate in my wedding planning after the planning is already done. Recently she was talking to her friend about her daughter‚Äôs wedding. Her friend‚Äôs mom is doing a lot for her daughter‚Äôs wedding. I am also getting married in a few months. My mom asked to be more involved in wedding planning. The problem is I‚Äôm already done planning my wedding. I got engaged over a year and a half ago so there was plenty of time to plan. Now there is nothing to do. On top of this she doesn‚Äôt live close by so the stuff that is left isn‚Äôt convenient to have her help with. 

I tried to be nice and tell her that while I appreciate her support I have it all in hand. She got really upset and said that I have walked her off to my life. She said that I don‚Äôt call or visit nearly enough. 

I pointed out that I am the one who calls and visits her 99.9% of the time. She never calls me because she says I‚Äôm too busy and won‚Äôt answer, and she has only visited me once in the last 5 years. Both are due to her inability to plan for the future. It‚Äôs true that I am busy but I have offered to schedule calls with her to catch up. She has never scheduled one with me. When it comes to visits I asked her to let me know two months in advance if she wants to come up to visit. That apparently is an unreasonable request. I have a busy life and I‚Äôm willing to make room for her and my dad but I‚Äôm not going to cancel plans because they want to do everything on a whim. 

She started crying and I feel bad being so harsh to her but ultimately our relationship should be a two way street. Also if she wants to be involved in my life she can but she can‚Äôt just jump in when it‚Äôs convenient to her. 

Another point of contention is that she helped pay for my wedding. She offered and I accepted. I traveled down to see her and try on dresses. She was uninterested in the experience and had not opinions during the appointment. Then she got mad that I picked a dress at another place without her. 

Now she‚Äôs saying that I am ungrateful and not letting her be a part of the wedding. My dad agrees and asked if they could pay for fireworks and put my mom in charge of the project so that she would feel included. I want to say no but am I just being petty? WIBTA for saying no to fireworks just because I‚Äôm annoyed my mom is trying to buy her way into my wedding planning at the 11th hour? 

Oh also my fianc√© doesn‚Äôt care either way. 

Edit: I thought I made this clear but we do not live close to each other. Her visiting me is a big trip. She stays for a while and I have to take off of work. It‚Äôs not like stoping by for dinner. Also I state this but Il say it again. I call her all of the time. "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to get rid of my cats.,27,2025-04-30 05:29:52,63,"I F(30) have been married to my husband M(36) for 7 years, we've been together for 9. We met in college as classmates (it was his second bachelor hence age difference) and started dating after knowing each other for about a year. In the first year of our relationship we took a cat together (his idea), as I have always had cats I was on board. We I got accidentally pregnant when I was 23 and we were therefore due to have a baby, we decided to take on a second cat (my idea) to keep the first one company since we might have a bit less attention for it with a new baby, and I've read research where it states it's better to have two cats then one for their mental health. 

We had our baby, and 2.5 years later another. We both work almost full time, with one day a week extra free to spend with our children, and so life is rather busy, with work, house hold tasks and taking care of our baby's. 

Here comes the issue, my husband wants to get rid of the cats. I love my cats, I cannot fathom giving them away. Additionally, I come from a culture that sees pets as family and for it to be a big shame to abandon your pets; my husband comes from a different culture. 

Admittedly the cats did cause us some nasty trouble that has led up to this, like they've been urinating on the couch in the past, but this problem seems solved now as they don't do this anymore ik unless something really upsets them, such as us going on a holiday; when they seems to have a bit of a relapse. The couch is covered by a waterproof cover to mitigate this problem and make clean up easier. 

I have plain point refused to get rid of the cats, and each time issues come up with how they bother my husband with him saying he does not want them anymore; causing us to fight and him even saying he might leave if this continues. One common one for example is him complaining about the cat miawing at the door of the garden at night to get in. We  go talking in circles here since we have made an agreement long time ago the cats would not be allowed out at night as they make so much noise and bother us and the neighbors. My husband goes out to the garden to smoke and they sneak out with him, however. He then proceeds to be awakened by the miauwing, gets angry and expects me to open the door for them. I proceed to say it's his responsibility as he let them out, and he says he will not be watching the cats not to get out as that is to much for him and he wants to be able to go outside comfortably, and if I want the cats I should take responsibility for this and go open the door for them each time. He says I don't respect him, he also mentions the term ""challenging him"", which I think is rather toxic. I say he's the one who doesn't respect me (and the cats), and even a roommate could watch for them not to go out when they open the door. I am exhausted with us fighting about this, I have been in a burn-out not too long ago and I am afraid I will get back to this again with these awful fights where we just talk in circles and don't get any conclusion. So, am I the asshole? And also, any advice is welcome.

EDIT: Thanks all for the comments so far! As for ""keep cats get rid of husband"", I love my husband too.  Although we keep fighting about such issues and he is imperfect, he also has great sides too him: he's a great, loving  and present dad, he does 50% of cleaning, cooking, school pick ups etc., he never forgets my birthday, buys me flowers, never critisizes my looks, is great in a crisis, interesting to talk to, open minded and pleasant to be around most of the time. So although we do have these bad disagreements like this when I get very upset with his attitude and he can even be selfish, he can also be great and generous, he is most of the time, so it's not so clear cut. Also he is under a lot of stress due to our finances not being great at the moment, and him trying to find a better job."
amitheasshole,AITA for not inviting my aunt to my wedding?,93,2025-04-29 22:34:50,41,"I (26M) am currently in medical school, and I‚Äôm getting married in five months. Because of student loans and being on a tight budget, my fianc√©e and I are keeping our wedding relatively modest. We‚Äôre inviting about 90‚Äì95 people, but our venue and food aren‚Äôt anything extravagant to keep cost low for the amount of people we invited, we‚Äôre genuinely happy with what we‚Äôve planned and excited to celebrate with loved ones.

When it came to the guest list, I decided to invite only one of my uncles and his SO. He‚Äôs always been supportive and present in my life, unlike my other aunts and uncles, who I rarely hear from. I figured it made more sense to prioritize friends over extended family I‚Äôm not close with.

Initially, I did plan to invite one of my aunts because my mom was upset I had not invited her in the first place so I decided to invite her only, not her partner. I‚Äôve had a rocky relationship with her SO due to past disagreements. I added her out of respect for my mom, who felt she should be included. I never speak with her and haven‚Äôt spoken to her in 3-4 years, But after speaking with my mother and explaining she‚Äôd be invited alone, my mom insisted it was wrong not to invite the whole family of five. She said it would look disingenuous, and ultimately asked me to take her off the list altogether. I agreed, since the invitation was really just to honor my mom‚Äôs wishes.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I got a message from my uncle (the one I did invite) saying he and his SO would like to withdraw his RSVP. He said that not inviting his sister (my aunt) would cause tension and make things feel personal, so they‚Äôd rather not attend. He said it was nothing personal but it was out of respect for his sibling.

I was really hurt. This uncle has always been important to me, and I didn‚Äôt expect this reaction. I even called him to talk, not because I had to, but because i genuinely would have loved if he came by.

That said, I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable inviting my aunt. So‚ÄîAITA for leaving her off the list?"
amitheasshole,AITA Shared getaway home with sister,36,2025-04-30 03:19:49,26,"AITA I Bought a getaway house with my sister. It's a nice weekend getaway. She is married, I am not. When we first started, we would visit together.

More recently, she asks me if her in laws and their kids can come visit. It was fine. I didn't go on weekends when they were there since it's not a big space. This became more frequent. Along with them leaving a mess for me to clean when I visit. I no longer get to enjoy my time there since I only go to clean up their mess. Messy stove, dirty toilets and showers, sometimes broken items.

I've resorted to posting signs to clean up after themselves before they leave. Seems reasonable to me. But they make it seem like I'm nitpicky with their cleaning job is not up to my standards. Now I have to keep quiet and can't even mention cleaning because they gaslight me like I'm the bad guy. I even suggested hiring a cleaner if they didn't want to clean. But they also do not want to pay.

I would say her in laws are there now 3 weeks out of the month and I am only there once. We split the bills in half. But I don't think it's fair anymore since they use a lot more of the electricity and water.

C and I met in School (it's a dual apprenticeship where you have Work and school for a day or two)

We were seated close to each other, had to work on an assignment and we were going along pretty fine. 

We cracked jokes, Talked about our jobs and just in general had a good time

we helped each other where we could. Through good and bad and for 2 years, everything seemed fine.
That was until i asked my boss if C could switch over here as the place she worked at couldn't keep her for 1 extra year.

biggest mistake ever because i got to learn how she was really like

she was rude, snappy and didn't fail to make sure i knew i was a burden to everyone 

she would rub her better grades in tests in my face and belittle me for the issues i had with my family 

at one point my mental health was so bad that it showed in my work performance 
not only did she worsen the situation but made sure to tell me how everyone at work hated me 

she also randomly started to ignore me for small things

like how i couldn't attend a spontaneous work meeting because i had financial to watch my brothers which had been planned days ahead, which wasn't a big deal to my boss but to C it somehow was, to the point where she told me that i should quit my job if i put my private issues above work ( to which i called my boss sobbing) or when i told her that she'd find every excuse in the book to excuse her boyfriends minor mess ups at work but if one of us did the same mistake, shed go bonkers, and she then also ignored me, or how i volunteered to run the social media sites of my workplace, to which she snapped at me because she wanted to do that instead of asking our boss if she could also take part in it.

the straw that broke the camels back though was Monday 

we had our discussions as usual about opinions, i wanted to change the topic, she took offense to it and decided to ignore me. That's not the worst part though 

the worst part is that when i called my colleague (D) to vent about this, D told me that i apparently snapped at another colleague based on what C had told D.

Yesterday we ignored each other at work though we did end up talking about work related stuff. This Morning she waited for me at the Train station as she usually did so we'd walk together to school but it blatantly walked past her without giving her any of my attention. And boy was she mad , i could tell from the huffing and puffing.
btw she's a full grown adult 
(also English isn't my first language)
so
AITJ for ignoring C?"
amitheasshole,AITA Neighbor complaining about our A/C,87,2025-04-29 20:43:05,55,"I live in a townhome that my partner and I rent. It‚Äôs one big building split into four units. We live in the second unit from the left from the outside. We have one neighbor to the left who owns their unit, with the other unit beside us being vacant currently. 

We moved in last summer and didn‚Äôt have any issues until around October where our A/C unit started malfunctioning and our property manager swapped it out free of charge.

After this unit had been installed, our neighbor started complaining to us that it was super loud and vibrating their whole house. I felt bad at first because I wanted to be considerate and so we scheduled for our A/C technician to come and take a look. For context, we kept using our A/C through the winter because our bedroom, which was on the top floor below the roof deck where the A/C unit is installed, gets really stuffy and there isn‚Äôt much air circulating in the room. 

We called in our technician after discussing with our property manager, and they had said that the unit was functioning as intended and the compressor was just working overtime since it was the winter time. The tech also mentioned the property manager didn‚Äôt pick the most high end unit and is probably why this is happening, but I think thats reasonable. He also confirmed our need for the A/C saying that our room was a hotspot and lacked any circulation. We also asked the tech to go into our neighbors place, because they asked him to come, and confirmed that what they were hearing was what we were hearing and i noticed that their house was indeed NOT vibrating as they had said. Admittedly there is a hum, but nothing too egregious and the tech even jokingly asked me ‚ÄúShould we just tell the neighbors to kick rocks?‚Äù

Our neighbors asked us to not use the A/C since it was still cold out and I agreed to try it out. So we did and it was fine, not great but manageable. 

Spring is rolling in and we started using the A/C and they complained again, asking us to call the tech to put in things that would minimize the disturbance. So we did. We had the tech come in at least 4 times in two weeks to install heavy duty pads under the A/C unit, a compressor blanket, and added rubber washers and rivets wherever possible. 

Now they‚Äôre still complaining, saying they aren‚Äôt able to have a good nights sleep because of our A/C etc. I feel as though we‚Äôve made every attempt within our power to make things better, but every time we do so, it‚Äôs not enough for them. I also believe we‚Äôre well within our rights to use the A/C in a reasonable manner, and I am also not willing to sacrifice my partner and I‚Äôs comfort for their sake by not using the A/C at all. Short of telling the property manager to purchase a new A/C unit just for the neighbors sake, which I would understand if they didn‚Äôt want to, I am out of ideas. 

TLDR; neighbor complaining about us using the A/C that we need, have made every attempt to better the situation, but they‚Äôre still complaining. 

CORRECTION: Everybody‚Äôs mentioning that we should direct them to our property manager. I forgot to mention that they have been speaking and they do have their number, they simply just keep reverting to speaking to us for some reason"
amitheasshole,AITA if I charge my gf 1k for rent while I pay 2k+?,3565,2025-04-29 00:34:06,1756,"My gf (26) and I (28) have been dating for two years. Now we would like to move in. We are currently in SoCal and living expenses is high out here

The amount that we‚Äôre seeing for rent is about $1800-2500. I don‚Äôt mind paying about $2k while my gf helps with atleast $1k or so for food, rent and utilities. 

Now she‚Äôs overreacting and saying how she doesn‚Äôt want to have the pressure of studying and going to school so she doesn‚Äôt wanna give the $1k. Maybe $500?

Regardless, am I the asshole for charging her? She‚Äôs saying that other people are supporting their gf without the pressure of bringing cash home.

 Further information, I got my career going and she is going to school for nursing.

UPDATE: People are asking the same questions:

She is in school for nursing. Income is weird since she is per diem. She takes shifts at a nursing home based on availability 

We discussed and she‚Äôs willing to provide 400-800. NOT 1k that I rounded up. She will work maybe 1 or 2 shifts per week or every other week. Depends on class schedules.

I am not in school anymore, I can afford to cover/provide for her. That way she can just focus on studies and we can reap the rewards later after she finishes. I think this is the right move

I just wanted people‚Äôs insights on the situation. I mean of course I will provide for my wife/fianc√© but  we are not engaged yet; we are bf/gf but we‚Äôre in it for the long haul."
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my family I'd move out if they got a dog?,0,2025-04-30 20:13:04,139,"My (19m) family recently brought up the idea of getting a dog. I told them (kind of joking, but also pretty serious) that if they did, I'd likely move out. I explained that I'm not a dog hater, but I've always been more of a cat person. I don't get that ""cute baby"" response people have to dogs, and while I get that they're smart and loyal, I just really don't want to *live* with one.

They're loud, they smell, and they're higher maintenance than cats. I have a hard time with noise and strong smells. They make me anxious and irritable. I said clearly that living with a dog would make my home life miserable. I've felt this way for years. It's not a random reaction.

My mom got upset and said I was being selfish and making an ""ultimatum,"" trying to make a decision for the whole household just because I don't want a dog. She said it would be unfair for everyone else to miss out on something they want just because of me. Then she compared it to the idea of euthanizing my favorite cat just because some of the family didn't want to live with him anymore, saying ""how would *you* feel if we all decided he had to go?"" I said that's completely different. She insisted it's the same because I'm standing in the way of what the group wants.

She also told me I've never actually lived with a dog so I don't really know what I'm talking about, and that she feels bad I've never gotten that experience. I replied that I've spent plenty of time around dogs (friends' houses, relatives', neighbors') and that's exactly why I *do* know I wouldn't handle it well. I don't need to move in with one to find that out.

I told her again this wasn't an ultimatum or threat. I'm not demanding anything. I just said if the house changes in a way that I know I can't live with, I'd have to make a change too. I asked them to at least consider my needs, but she said I was being dramatic and ended the call.

AITA?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA for throwing/donating my ex best friends stuff in my garage.,25,2025-04-30 03:03:40,25,"I (25f) and my husband (23m) took in my former best friend September 2024. 

For some background/context on myself and ex friend: we‚Äôve known eachother since birth‚Ä¶. Her mom cut my umbilical cord because my dad was apparently throwing up in a corner. So our moms have been besties since high school and still are. When I was 2 I was at her birth and even got to hold her (no I don‚Äôt remember I was 2). Either way we have been through essentially everything through each other, even our horrible teenage years, which got really bad mostly for her. I moved about three hours away when I was 17 but always continued to come back, especially through my college years and now that I have a kid and a husband, we‚Äôre always up visiting that way, and made time to go see her. 

OK into the story I guess ‚Ä¶. In September 2024, my husband and I decided to get her out of where she was and move her into our house. She was on probation so we had already set up everything with the new officer and even had job interviews lined up and had goals to get an apartment of her own in town. 

Three days and she was arrested and essentially destroyed anything that we ever had sadly. As I said, we have a daughter in my husband, and I are actually sober of alcohol, so her being arrested in the manner she was was not only traumatizing for my husband and I but really was a reality of check for who we help and how many people we have been helping. My family that we had worked so hard to build was almost ripped apart by someone I had trusted so much. 

Either way her stuff to this day seven months later still sits on our garage and despite everyone‚Äôs pleads to have me donate it or just throw it away‚Ä¶ I CANT. 
I just can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶.
That‚Äôs my best friend stuff ‚Ä¶ 
Well, ex best friend ‚Ä¶.. 

I just know that if I was her or if I would‚Äôve been in the situation, I really would hope that someone no matter how bad I hurt them would keep my stuff safe until I was able to come get it. It‚Äôs safe and protected in our garage, but I just can‚Äôt donate it or get rid of it..

We‚Äôve been in contact with the district attorney and done everything we possibly could with the sheriffs department and the PD. We simply wait weeks for an answer and as the summer approaches, my husband and my grandma are very anxious to get stuff out of the garage to be able to do summer activities and throw summer parties. They truly think that we should just throw it. Donate it or keep whatever I wanna keep.

That feels heartless and bitchy of me‚Ä¶ like I said, despite everything that that‚Äôs been done and how I‚Äôve been hurt personally by someone who has essentially been my sister‚Ä¶. It makes me feel like I am quite possibly the worst person ever to just get rid of it. 

I‚Äôm hoping to hear back from the district attorney soon, but my husband and I were talking about possibly giving it a June cut off date. I told him maybe we could just push it to September and give her a whole year to come collect her stuff‚Ä¶. 

So would I be the asshole if I did just get rid of her stuff‚Ä¶?"
amitheasshole,AITA for calling my friend fake after her breakup,2,2025-04-30 20:00:22,6,"My friend Ana recently broke up w her bf of 3yrs. We have a common friend, AJ. We‚Äôve been friends for 6yrs & I introduced them a year after I met Ana.

Long story short for almost two months, Ana would spam call and text me all hours of the day about how much she misses her ex. She‚Äôd occasionally go into extreme and uncomfortable detail about his body and their intimacy, how she misses it. One thing she was adamant about with me is that the thought of being intimate with anybody else was repulsing. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see myself touching anybody else the way I did him or letting anyone put their hands on me the way he did.‚Äù She‚Äôd be crying as she said this and had a heartbroken hopeless romantic thing going on, but at the exact same time she was telling me all that, she had told our friend AJ about how she had 2 guys after her and made out with one of them and spit in his mouth while jerking him off.

After AJ told me, I tried guiding convos with Ana to get her to tell me, but she didn‚Äôt so I just asked her. ‚ÄúHave you done anything with anyone at all?‚Äù  She got really offended and said I was a bad friend for thinking that and she‚Äôs grieving. A week later I haven‚Äôt mentioned it again but AJ mentions ‚Äúspit guy‚Äù in our gc while she‚Äôs telling a story. I ask ‚Äúspit guy??‚Äù She goes ‚Äúoh yeah I spit in his mouth‚Äù and changes the subject. 3 mins later she says she misses her ex. I say ‚Äúspitting in a guys mouth doesnt seem like you miss him.‚Äù 

She starts scolding me and says I can‚Äôt lecture on something I know nothing about. She tells me she ‚Äúonly kissed him as a joke.‚Äù I tell her that AJ told me everything she said, and she stops texting for a few seconds. 

‚ÄúWhat did he say? prob some crazy sht that doesnt sound like me at all right?‚Äù 
I tell her it feels like she‚Äôs fake with me and she says she‚Äôs not and that I can‚Äôt judge her on something she did when she wasnt in a clear state of mind. She started getting rly defensive and sent a ton of voice messages that sounded like narcissistic excuses. I sent them to AJ and he agreed. 
 
Bottom line is I‚Äôm upset she told me things to alter my thoughts abt her. She says not telling me isn‚Äôt lying, but she was actively acting oppositely from what she was telling me. So AITA?"

Usually I never forget to do my homework and I am honor student in my school. I have 99.5 ATAR and is on a scholarship. Yesterday I forgot to do my homework (Which was only once) and got yelled at. I was under a lot of stress preparing for university and I was very busy. I had to study hard and also take care of my sister (9F).

amitheasshole,WIBTA for waking my brother and his friend up every time the cats wake me up?,0,2025-05-01 05:12:48,25,"Hi! I, 18 nb, live at home still. And for the 8 years I've lived in my current home, my brother, 19 mshuts his door. That wouldn't be an issue if my room wasn't connected to his. My house is old, and was originally a duplex. My parents believe his room was originally the living room, and mine the only bedroom in the upstairs apartment, since it has a closet. My room is connected to his via a door, which the latch no longer works to. 

So my issue is that 4 years ago, we got new kittens after my cat Emily passed away. And they soon realized that I'm a light sleeper, so every time they got stuck in my brother and i's rooms, they'd knock my collectables or my cup of water, or my water bottle, or something else, down to wake me up. This is absolute hell because i work early mornings, 7:30 am, and i have to wake up at 5 am to get ready and be on time. Usually my cats knock things over around 2 or 3 am. It disturbs my sleep and makes my life hell. I've talked to my brother repeatedly, andhe says he'll stop but never does.

 I've had to have told him, even yelled at him about it while in physical tears because i was just that tired of everything, so many times that he should have gotten the hint to simply just check for cats and open his door, which usually there is one (recently every goddamn night). Recently a family friend of ours, 20 m, moved in temporarily till he gets back on his feet. And even though he knows, he's seen me have mental breakdowns over it, he does it too. I'm thinking of either dropping the cat(s) on them every time, or waking them up every time. I will give them one last warning if so. I'm fed up with it. I just want to sleep. So, WIBTA to wake my brother and his friend up every time the cats are locked in our rooms? 


Edit to get a little bit more into detail on why propping the door open, keeping it ajar, or talking to him yet again, wouldn't work: 
It wouldn't work unless he's cooperative, and he's proven he's not, and also just keeping the door ajar wouldn't work because 1. House is built like crap, and my brother's door will keep shutting on it's own, or be wide open (very dangerous because his door is right in front of the steps downstairs and 3 dazed/sleepy steps wrong and you're in the ER) and 2, if it were to be propped ajar, it would yet again rely on my brother because it's his door that needs to be shut because it's his room mine is connected to. I need proper sleep because even on the best schedules i need to wake up at 7:30 to get to work on time. And I'm not about to go to sleep at 7 or 8 pm just to get my sleep schedule messed up when all it relys on is my brother simply keeping the cats outside. Also, our parents had also talked to him about it multiple times, because they would urinate and dedicate on his floor because they can't leave to get to the litterboxes


I'll reply in the morning. I luckily have the day off but this is so upsetting because of the fact i repeatedly asked him to stop. I just want proper sleep and it's hard enough with insomnia 


Update. 

My brother and i talked and he agreed that is a bit of a dick move for him to neglectfully just shut the door without checking. He's going to do it from now on. Hopefully. I'll talk to the mods to close comments on this post since it was resolved"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to say sorry out of pride?,10,2025-04-30 07:33:23,26,"Me, my friends and colleagues, and two other friends (who I'll call Abby and Beau) got into a spat some weeks ago. Long story short, we are all theater people, and Abby and Beau were watching one of our shows for the second time. They were being very loud; clearly enjoying it but being a nuisance for the rest of the audience. This led to more than a few people - including a few of us playing - to tell them to turn it down a notch in the intermission.

It didn't turn over well. Both Abby and Beau were hurt and felt betrayed by us, and sat center-stage and frowned at us the whole second act. At a get-together afterwards, A decided to leave while Beau were consoled by a number of people in a very visible manner. Our stage manager was also pretty frustrated that we didn't go through her, which is very fair.

Abby eventually met up with us at a meeting, said her part and asked that something like this never should happen again, and we agreed; none of us wanted this really - and that's where I left it. I knew Beau would not be talking to me for a while, but thought that it'd be best to wait a bit.

Here's why I think I may be a stubborn asshole: Abby recently took me aside and urged me to say sorry to Beau. I did briefly say sorry on the day of the thing but it was pretty quick... And the more I think about it, the less I want to say sorry again.

It's not that I'm not sorry, I am - it's that I feel manipulated. The strong negative vibes they put out, the consoling in the middle of a crowded party for all to see, the ""you should say sorry"" urging. It feels like Beau indirectly is trying to overtake my mental bandwidth.

I've been close to emotionally manipulative people before, where I had to learn to break away from it, and I sorta feel like engaging Beau is like willingly diving into it again. If Beau wants to talk I'm so down, but I hate being urged to do something like saying ""sorry"", something that matters, if I don't mean it.

I've known Beau for a while now, and I know her well enough that it won't be forgotten, and least of all forgiven. She talks about people she feels has wronged her many years after the fact, including partners and previous people she's worked with. I fear that whatever I do, I'll be one of those stories, even if I do say sorry - and then what's the point.

Aand on the other hand, I could just say fucking sorry and be done with it. I fear that may not be the end of it because I don't think Beau will let it go completely, but that would mean I'd done my part.

So, Am I the Asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for kicking my mother out of our house for making comments about my wife‚Äôs pregnancy,5784,2025-04-28 20:35:18,667,"I37m have been married to my wife36 for 12 years. We have a 10 year old son who is autistic.  3 years ago, my wife had a stillbirth. She‚Äôs currently 21 weeks pregnant and of course we‚Äôre hoping for the best and praying of course. My wife has severe anxiety about this pregnancy now as well along with nightmares and I‚Äôve just been trying to do my best for her. She‚Äôs been seeing a therapist. 

We had dinner with my parents a few days ago for a family event, and my mom began talking how hopefully this one‚Äôs born healthy mentally and physically implying about our sons autism. I instantly shut her down and said that‚Äôs not even on our minds, she made a comment saying it should be, and my father told her to stop. A little later on she started talking again asking if my wife‚Äôs considered highrisk because she‚Äôs of her age then went on to say how she‚Äôll be praying for us bc it‚Äôs more likely to happen if it‚Äôs happened before and my wife‚Äôs age plays a factor now as well. 

I then said okay I think it‚Äôs time for you to leave. She got upset and said what she said was kind, and I said I already told you not to bring it up. We got into a huge argument but she did end up leaving, my father apologized on her behalf.

Later that night my mom started texting me calling me an ah and said she couldn‚Äôt believe I would kick her out of my house for saying she‚Äôd pray for me, and how badly I broke her heart tonight. She went on a rant how this isn‚Äôt how she raised me. She texted me again today saying she‚Äôs still waiting for an apology. Aita

amitheasshole,AITA for having a shower when my mum asked me to help with the dishes?,40,2025-04-29 23:40:27,42,"Yesterday, at maybe around 7:20pm, JUST as I was about to go into the shower, like clothes off, shower warmed up, my mum asked me to help with the dishes. I texted her and I said I was just about to go into the shower, and she text me back, saying to come down after then. I was going to wash my hair, which takes ages because it's really thick, so i messaged her and told her i would be maybe 20 - 30 mins, and maybe she could ask my brother, to which she didn't respond.

Around 15 - 20 mins later, just as I was about to get changed, she messages me and says she is going to take away things I've bought with my own money, that she is going to smash things.

Maybe a bit of context, but she is menopausal, and can get really angry in an instant. She has always been like this my whole life. She also drinks every day. I'm not sure how much, but she drinks at least 4 or 5 full glasses of wine every day, and she starts at around 3pm. She buys 1 or 2 bottles a day. As it gets later in the day, and the more she has had to drink she gets more irritated.

She started having a go at my younger brother, when she mixed up something I said (which was that I would be around 20 mins) for him saying it, and then backtracked when he said that wasn't him. Then, because I was naked, I opened the door and shouted down the stairs that I would be down in a minute. We just went back and forth about how I should have come down, depsite her saying I could come down after. My step dad, who never intervenes when she's like this, only when he feels like we've done something, said he was sick of the shouting, and I just said fine, and slammed the door, which I shouldn't have done.

Something that will be important in a minute, me and my grandma, and my aunt, have a group chat for a show we all watch. They were in the group chat asking if everyone was watching, and I said I wouldn't be, and explained what happened. In no way, did I have a conversation with either of them about it, just that we had a disagreement about the dishes.

This morning, she was fine, as she always is, like it never happened, and we were back to normal, and had a fun conversation. But as I was helping her today, which was around 7:30pm, and by this time had had a few drinks, she accused me of speaking to my grandma about it to try and get her into trouble? I said I told her what happened but we didn't speak about it. It ended with her calling me an ""inconsiderate cunt"".

She came upstairs an hour later on the phone with my grandma. I'm not sure what the conversation was, but i heard her shout ""fuck off"" and then she came into my room, and called me a ""spiteful bitch"" for getting my grandma to lie about what we talked about, which I haven't done. I assume my grandma said the exact same thing as me, which is what happened.

I know I should have gone down and helped, but I was one foot in the shower, and she said that it was okay to come down after, I'm just not sure if I'm an asshole or not. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for sending my ex best friend a photo after he blocked me?,0,2025-04-30 19:06:19,23,"My friend and I were really close for about a year‚Äîwe became best friends the day we met. A few months later, we stopped talking due to a situation that both of us were responsible for. We were both in the wrong.

A few months after that, I reached out again. He was dating someone new, and I ended up becoming friends with both of them. His partner was actually the one who wanted to meet me, since I had been my friend's best friend. We all created a group chat and talked pretty often. I got along with his boyfriend, and everything seemed fine.

About a week later, my best friend and I were playing Roblox. We got distracted and my best friend ended up not responding much to his partner. Later, I got a message from his boyfriend out of nowhere saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be friends with you anymore.‚Äù It seemed emotional, so I messaged my best friend with a screenshot asking what was going on.

He explained that his partner was upset because he hadn‚Äôt been replying‚Äîhe was playing with me instead. I apologized, saying I didn‚Äôt mean to cause any issues. My friend told me it wasn‚Äôt my fault; it was his for not responding. He said he‚Äôd talk to his boyfriend.

Afterward, he told me his partner said, ‚ÄúGo be with them instead,‚Äù referring to me. He was clearly frustrated. Then his partner accused me of being into my best friend.

This hurt, especially because I‚Äôve had feelings for someone else for over a year‚Äîand they both knew that. I never gave any signs that I was into my best friend. But his boyfriend said he didn‚Äôt trust us texting alone.

So, my friend blocked me.

A few days later, I painted a picture of a cat sitting on the moon in the night sky‚Äîsomething my best friend specifically asked me to paint. I sent it via text, thinking I was still blocked, just in case he ever unblocked me and saw it.

Turns out, he had already unblocked me‚Äîand I had no idea. I immediately apologized for the message, explaining I thought I was still blocked.

So‚Ä¶ AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for reporting my roommates for smoking indoors?,37,2025-04-29 23:03:17,31,"I 18F, have been living with five suitemates (all F, 17-19) for my first two semesters of college. When I first met them, I quickly found out that almost all of them vaped frequently, like multiple times every day. The only person who doesn't smoke other than myself, is my roommate (18F). I would like to preface that I have no ill-will against those who choose to smoke, whatever it may be, but I have chronic asthma. The serious kind, that gets you hospitalized and on daily medication. As well as the fact that we all signed an agreement from our college informing us that we aren't to be drinking nor smoking on school property‚Äîincluding the dorms‚Äîand reports of such will have consequences. In that agreement it also states that if there are damages to the rooms or common area (which includes the lingering smell of weed), that the people living in that dorm will be charged for damages. I, being a broke college student, do not want to pay those potential charges because of the behavior of my careless roommates.

When I found out that they vape, I told them about my asthma and they (for a short period) stopped smoking in our living room and around me in general. Then, later into the semester, they started smoking weed. They'd invite their friends over, smoke weed, vape, and generally make the living room smell like shit. The smell has been so bad that it can consistently linger within the shared living room and kitchen area for days. I started going into my room more often to avoid the smell, and never really addressed it because: 1. they know they shouldn't be smoking, and 2. my roommate and I are the only people in this dorm that don't smoke‚Äîand I don't think they would particularly care about what we had to say, given that we are the minority in this household.

In early spring, I found my asthma getting particularly worse‚Äîwheezing more often, getting very sick for weeks long, coughing up yellow phlegm, and my medication not being as effective as before. I had attributed that to the fact that I've been living in an area that's not safe for my condition, given that I am consistently involuntarily second-hand smoking whenever I leave my room. So, me and my roommate take it upon ourselves to report their behavior to the RA (our resident advisor), who took it to our college and reported it to them. Earlier this morning, everyone in the dorm got a followup email regarding the report, scheduling 1-on-1 meetings with college housing. I feel like I did the right thing, but my roommate thinks that it was a mistake to report them, saying it's 'gone too far'. Depending on what our college decides, this report may cause my roommates to be ineligible for on-campus housing for future semesters, meaning they would either need to find off-campus housing or transfer schools, depending on their situation. Am I the asshole?

amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to pay my sister back for our meal?,814,2025-04-29 06:03:42,180,"
My sister and I visited Grill'd a few days ago. Grill'd has a ""Mad Bunday"" promotion where if you spend $20, you get a free burger. She ordered her own lunch, and because she spent $20, I was able to avail of the promotion and get a free burger for me.

To explain: she had her own food paid for, and my burger was free because of the promotion ‚Äî it didn't cost her anything extra.

Now she's asking me to pay her $20, saying that I owe her for dinner. But from my point of view, I didn't order anything that she paid for ‚Äî she ordered her own stuff and paid for it herself, I got the free burger promotion, and that's it. And besides, I'm in a bit of a tight financial spot without a job (I'm looking) and $20 makes a huge difference to me right now.

She says I'm being an asshole for not paying her, but I don't think I have to when it didn't cost her anything.
AITA?

Edit: it was my coupon, she didn't plan to take the burger home because she didn't know about the coupon untill I used it.

Update: thanks for all the opinions! I have just paid her $10."
amitheasshole,AITA for bringing up the lack of reciprocity in my friendship ?,1,2025-04-30 18:06:30,9,"Might be a long rant ahead so please bear with me ü•≤

I‚Äôve been sitting on this for months but decided to finally say something. For context, my friend and I are the same age, met in college as classmates, and just started work in the same (stressful, toxic) legal field. So I get that most of us are overwhelmed.

In my friend groups, I‚Äôm usually the initiator/planner‚Äîand I genuinely enjoy it because I get to decide fun stuff! But it only works if I feel the other person wants to hang out too. When I‚Äôm always the one asking, I start to wonder: are we meeting up just because I initiated? Would they make the effort if I didn‚Äôt?

Sometimes I step back to test this‚Äînot to be toxic, but to see if the effort is mutual. That‚Äôs what I did with my bestie, and I noticed she hasn‚Äôt really asked to meet. Saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs been too long, let‚Äôs meet!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt count to me unless there‚Äôs actual follow-through. Especially when I see that she is meeting other friends, particularly XYZ (someone she said is hard to catch, so I assume she‚Äôs initiating there too).

This imbalance has been bothering me, and I wondered if I did something unknowingly to offend her. When I brought it up, she said I was being calculative and keeping score. But if I don‚Äôt bring it up, it just eats at me. I do notice she hasn‚Äôt initiated, and I do see her making time for others on social media. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong to feel hurt?

She told me she‚Äôs been rethinking our friendship because she doesn‚Äôt feel emotionally connected to me. Apparently, it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt respond how she hoped during some tough moments (e.g., when she texted her ex for closure). I acknowledge I‚Äôm not always warm‚ÄîI tend to intellectualize things (ENTP problems)‚Äîbut I really didn‚Äôt know she wanted more from me. I thought we could talk more in person when we met the next day.

She also said she didn‚Äôt like my ‚Äúconscious stream of thoughts‚Äù texts. But that‚Äôs literally how we used to bond‚Äîrandom daily updates, funny observations, or complaints (like how people don‚Äôt wear deodorant‚Äîsomething she often ranted about too!). Now it feels like she‚Äôs shifting the goalposts.

Also, she rarely replies or replies selectively, which makes me feel unheard. It‚Äôs like talking to someone IRL who just doesn‚Äôt respond‚Äîawkward and disheartening. I stopped sending her everything because I didn‚Äôt want to overwhelm her, but now she says she feels overwhelmed by those updates. How? When you weren‚Äôt replying in the first place?

So yeah, I haven‚Äôt replied to her response yet because I don‚Äôt want to say the wrong thing. We previously clashed over reliability, and I started considering the possibility that maybe we‚Äôre just not that close anymore. Maybe now is the time to let it go.

I still value our shared humour, political/social values (girls support girls!), and the connection we used to have. It felt like we could talk about anything and truly enjoyed each other‚Äôs company. But that‚Äôs not really happening anymore.

If you‚Äôve read this far, I‚Äôd really appreciate your 2 cents."
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I don't pay for my girlfriends share of our annual trip because she still hasn't paid her share from the last 2?,1996,2025-04-29 00:01:27,390,"My GF and I (40‚Äôs) have been together quite a while, but we're on different pages financially. I make considerably more than her (but she has a healthy middle class income), and I'm also much better at managing my money. She has ADHD (medicated) and struggles with impulse spending. On top of this she comes from a well-off family who have historically not been shy about floating her cash when needed. We live together and I pay about 2/3 - 3/4 of the household expenses so I feel we're equitable there

Last year, we did two trips and I paid up front for them. We agreed on what her contribution to each was going to be (less than half the cost) and I put the tickets, accom's etc. on my card. She agreed to pay me back when she could. To date - she's made 1 small instalment on her share. I haven't hassled her about it because I understand her ADHD makes it hard for her to stick to budgets and ¬†have been mostly content to let her pay it back on her own time as she had some credit card debt she wanted to pay off (I found out last week she has not moved significantly on the CC debt)

I've been getting frustrated because it increasingly falls on me to pay for things that she should be contributing to. For example she hasn't contributed to a vet bill for our dogs in over 2 years. If I ask, she'll tell me she has no money for it, but seems to have enough money to order take-out for lunch most days.

We've talked about her spending in therapy together (finance is an ongoing subject) and our therapist has said that I‚Äôm going to have to draw a line in the sand and just say no at some point if she won't implement her own systems to manage her finances on her own.

Last night, we were talking about me taking a flight to go visit my family (parents & sibs).¬† She asked where I was going to send her if I got to go for a flight and I was kind of speechless, and I just tried to laugh it off and made a joke along the lines of I was still waiting on help to pay off the last trip we went on. She said she didn't believe she had any debt, but would really like to go to Scotland for our next trip since we were talking about flights. I responded that I thought that would be great, and how much did she think she'd have saved to contribute to that trip and she said ""nothing, it's gonna be sponsored by BF.""

Maybe she was joking around but it left a bad taste in my mouth. It's less about the money and more about the sense that she feels she shouldn't have to contribute that's really bothering me. It's the feeling that I'm a piggybank rather than a partner.

So - if I say I won't front the money for another trip somewhere until she starts honouring our existing agreements and contributing to the trip fund - WIBTA? I don't want to feel cheap and I want to do things with her, but feeling like a piggybank sucks.

Thanks

**TLDR: Girlfriend hasn't paid back agreed upon amounts from our last 2 trips but wants to start planning our next one. WIBTA if I refuse to take her somewhere?**

amitheasshole,AITA for indicating the obvious about the absence of our window A/C unit?,0,2025-04-30 15:32:08,19,"Hello!

This morning, my partner and I had a conversation about how the weather is warming up and what we could do to cool it down.

We live in a 1 bedroom apartment where last weekend we installed a new window unit A/C in the living room. We have another old A/C unit that we uninstalled together last year as the weather was getting colder - however, we just haven't gotten around to installing it back in our bedroom window as the nights were still cool the last few weeks.

This morning, we woke up and noticeably felt that bedroom was quite warm as the weather is now getting warmer. Normally, we close our bedroom door when we head to bed out of habit as we both feel more secure when the door isn't wide open while we sleep (we live alone, btw.. it's more of a psychological feeling of safety thing, I suppose).

While talking to my partner about solutions to what we can do to keep our bedroom cool (until we get around the installing of our old A/C unit. Side note - the concept of installing the old A/C unit wasn't brought up - I had thought it was just mutually understood because I remember the both of us struggling a bit to uninstall the A/C unit last year as we had the shift furniture around in our room to uninstall it safely), I suggest we just keep our bedroom door open and let the living room A/C do it's work.

My partner then looks at me perplexed and asks me why we would do that if we have the window A/C unit in our bedroom. My response was to then look back in bewilderment because... there is no A/C unit installed currently in our small (10ft x 16ft) bedroom. Mind you, my partner also opens the curtains to our window every day to let light in after we get up.. there is one window in our bedroom.

We have an awkward moment of looking at each other until it clicks for my partner that the A/C unit isn't there. I end this interaction with a small ""duh"" - which i dont believe i used in a patronizing tone. It was a short, simple ""duh"" - which I have used many times before as slang and with no ill-intent. We have not had problems with this before as we both have used this term out of jibe-y endearment. However this time, my partner takes offense to this and tells me that I should've just asked ""don't you remember we uninstalled our bedroom window a/c unit?"" 

I respond by saying that I don't think I really have to ask in that way as it seemed pretty obvious that the window unit isn't there (though.. now as I'm writing this out.. im realizing that even if something seems really really obvious to me, perhaps it is not so obvious to others.. I've written this much out though.. so I might as well finish). 

My partner had to leave for the office (I'm working from home today) so our conflict resolution was put on pause for the time being.

That being said.. given the context.. AITA for indicating the obvious here?"
amitheasshole,AITA for how my roommate blew up on me because of how I asked my other roommate to take their clothes out of the dryer?,18,2025-04-29 23:49:32,17,"Hey Reddit

I live with 3 roommates in an apartment with in-unit laundry. We‚Äôre all finishing undergrad. While it‚Äôs become customary to ask in the group chat before moving someone‚Äôs laundry, it was never a hard rule until recently.

I‚Äôve lived with roommates for years and have always followed the unspoken norm that it‚Äôs fine to move finished laundry whether it be wet clothes from the washer to the dryer or dry clothes out as long as it‚Äôs done respectfully (I always put it in a clean bag and not on the floor and neatly place their laundry inside, and leave it outside their room). No one ever complained, and I‚Äôve always allowed the same if I left my laundry in too long.

That changed a couple weeks ago when one roommate got annoyed that I transferred their wet clothes to the dryer and later moved the dried ones into a duffel bag outside their door. They asked me to request permission next time. Despite my stark disagreement (and having spent the last 8 months doing this with no issues from them) I decided to bite the bullet and respect their preference moving forward.

Btw also worth noting that this roommate tends to get upset over things that weren‚Äôt previously established preferences (like the sudden expectation to sort silverware in the drawer after 8 months of nobody doing so). This roommate has also been acting cold and pissy towards me and my best friend who is the fourth roommate for weeks, despite us literally never being home or using dishes or making any kind of noise or mess. We‚Äôre literally only at home to sleep. I have no semblance of a clue why they‚Äôd be pissed at us.

Fast forward to today: their clothes were sitting in the dryer. I needed to do a load before heading out, so out of courtesy I texted, ‚ÄúWhose clothes are in the dryer?‚Äù (again a completely customary way this question gets asked in our GC all the time). They replied, ‚ÄúMine, I‚Äôll take them out when I get home.‚Äù An hour passed, so I followed up with, ‚ÄúETA?‚Äù I genuinely needed clothes and wasn‚Äôt trying to be passive aggressive.

Then my other roommate (also my ex - and best friends with the roommate I was talking to btw) chimed in: ‚ÄúBruh üò≠ god forbid they have class.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúGod forbid I ask when a communal dryer will be available so I can wash my clothes before noon? You‚Äôd be well within your right to move mine if roles were reversed.‚Äù They replied ‚ÄúSit the fuck down dawg and have some patience and courtesy.‚Äù

From there I calmly explained I had every right to ask when the dryer would be free. My ex then accused me of being toxic and hurtful. I didn‚Äôt move the clothes against my roommate‚Äôs wishes, I just left after that.

AITA for asking ‚ÄúETA?‚Äù in a shared laundry situation, after already agreeing to not touch their clothes?"
amitheasshole,AITA for yelling at my mom after she disrespected my boundaries,19,2025-04-30 00:03:26,41,"(17 F) For the last few years, I've always told my mom not to clean my room for me without asking due to privacy reasons, I've never hidden anything bad or illegal, but there's a few personal things with friends that I don't want her to find, she has been respectful since I've asked of her to do it, however today after school she said ""I cleaned your room today, don't get mad I didn't throw away anything"" which was a lie, she threw away some notes and stuff from old friends which where very sentimental to me, after I saw everything she did, I talked to her and said something along the lines of ""why did you clean my room for me without asking, you know I asked you not to do that anymore"" she then replied with ""why, are you hiding something?"" To which I said ""no, but I want to have privacy"" and she then said ""you can get privacy when your 18, for now you don't get any"" I then yelled at her for disrespecting my boundaries, am I in the wrong?

amitheasshole,AITA for arguing with my mom over money?,8,2025-04-30 04:49:11,35,"Here‚Äôs come context. I‚Äôm 19 years old male. Mom is 42. 6 months ago, I bought a Jeep Wrangler for $11,000. $8,000 was from my pocket and my mom helped me out with the remaining $3,000. Historically, I‚Äôve been a huge fan of older BMW‚Äôs which don‚Äôt have a great track record for reliability. I‚Äôm a huge fan of buying older BMW‚Äôs, fixing anything wrong with them, and selling them to make a profit. This is the first car I buy that‚Äôs not classified as a sporty car. This Jeep was meant to be practical for the harsh Canadian winter (which is certainly was), and I would sell my previous car (also a BMW) because the Jeep is definitely a lot safer in the snow. 

I‚Äôve recently been dealing with some financial stress in my personal life. Due to this I‚Äôve decided to downsize from my Jeep back into another BMW which only costs $2000. I sold my Jeep today for $13,000, profiting $2000 from the sale, essentially making the new BMW free. 

My younger sister (10F) was talking to my mom today and told her that I sold my Jeep before I had the chance to tell her about it. My mom got extremely upset, accusing me of not being thankful for the money she lent me to buy the Jeep, accusing me of not asking her before selling the Jeep (the Jeep was only in my name, not in her name at all), and was making a huge deal out of it and asking what im going to do now. She then demanded I give her the entire $13,000 by the end of the week or she threatened she would call the police (I don‚Äôt know what for, I did not do anything illegal). 

I tried to stay calm the entire time during the argument. I tried to understand her point of view, which was: the Jeep is a safe, reliable car, and BMW‚Äôs are not. Which is totally fair and understandable from her perspective. I‚Äôm a young guy who has always had a passion for fixing these cars, as I find it to be a hobby for myself. I also understand her perspective of the fact that she gave me $3,000 to help buy the Jeep. Obviously, I would be returning her $3,000 regardless, but she has demanded the full $13,000. I said that I was going to put the money into long term investing and downsize to a BMW. Frankly, im also very bored of the Jeep as it‚Äôs slow. 

She has since left the house and went for a drive. She said that she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me until the full amount of $13,000 is deposited into her account.

So guys, am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for declining a late invite I got to a coworker‚Äôs wedding?,1003,2025-04-29 01:08:28,383,"My coworker, who is also my boss‚Äôs son, is getting married in July. Months ago, around October/November, several of my other coworkers already got hand delivered invitations to the wedding. During this initial period, I was admittedly a little hurt not to be included, though I tried to remain professional and keep it to myself. It really stung, especially hearing those included chatter about wedding talk openly around the office, in front of me knowing I wasn‚Äôt included. 

Today I got an invitation. I was extremely surprised, and a little confused since I thought I wasn‚Äôt invited. I did initially stutter a little and ask something like ‚ÄúOh, why now?‚Äù because I was caught off guard. He (also kind of clumsily) explained that they invited close friends and family first, and had to see who couldn‚Äôt come before they invited others. It was an awkward interaction. I didn‚Äôt even know sending out invites in stages was a thing people did, I thought they all went out at the same time. 

After a moment of deliberation I, in a way I felt was gracious, I kindly and softly declined the invitation. I thanked him for thinking of me and told him I appreciated the invite, but regretted I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it (and I handed the invitation back - I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with it??). And that was that. 

Now, my internal thought process was that I‚Äôve always been taught not to accept a late invitation, because why attend a party or gathering you were only invited to as an afterthought? Also he specifically told me I only got an invite because someone else couldn‚Äôt make it. I also felt a little humiliated in the moment, because not only was I a second-string invite, but my coworkers who were invited months ago would know that I‚Äôm second-string. 

Now everyone is acting a little cold to me, including my boss, and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole. 

I think I might be the asshole because I handed the invitation back (that felt awkward), and because it might seem like my decline was coming from a place of resentment and bitterness about not being included in the first wave. I can see how it could be interpreted that way, though I think it was coming from a place of trying to protect my self-worth. 

So, AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to babysit my BFs niece during my vacation?,5450,2025-04-28 16:10:49,1259,"I am currently visiting my bf while he is on a long term work trip. I arrived Saturday and I‚Äôm staying for a week and a half. This first weekend was uneventful because he was feeling very sick. I stayed in all day Saturday and helped clean up his place and paid attention to him. On Sunday he felt well enough to go out and play football for 4 1/2 hours. I watched him for the first hour before walking the city and catching a drop in pedicure. He still has to work during the weekdays, so this morning while I was still getting ready he sent me a text saying:

‚ÄúMy niece is coming to stay Saturday and Sunday, I‚Äôm bringing her to football and you have to watch her, so no walking the city for you.‚Äù

I was FURIOUS. First of all, I‚Äôm on vacation. I did NOT sign up to babysit for a full weekend of this trip. I asked how old she was, since if she‚Äôs old enough to stay here by herself is she not old enough to stay by the picnic area while he plays? He doesn‚Äôt even know how old she is, only that ‚Äúshe needs a guardian‚Äù 

I‚Äôm also devastated because that was the only weekend where we could go out while he was off. I told him specifically months ago that I wanted to go on a certain tour with him on his day off and he‚Äôs apparently forgotten. When I reminded him, he said we could go after work on Friday. That‚Äôs taking a full day experience and chopping it in half. 

He says that since he is letting me stay for free that I could spare a day to babysit his niece while he plays football. He gets his housing paid for by his work and also IM HIS GIRLFRIEND?? Like why wouldn‚Äôt I stay for free what are you going to do, charge me hotel fees? 

AITA for freaking out about this? 

EDIT FOR CLARITY: By refusing to babysit his niece I am effectively forcing him to drop his activities to watch over her. 
I had no prior notice of her coming while I was visiting, he waited until he left work to tell me. I don‚Äôt know if he knew she was coming and waited to tell me or if he just found out himself."
amitheasshole,AITA for not giving back a sweater to a guy I met on a dating app?,0,2025-05-01 02:16:23,74,"

I recently went on two dates with a guy I matched with on a dating app. Things started off nice and I thought it something worth to give my time on‚Äî  On our first date, he initiated all the kisses and cuddles even though I wanted to take it slow. He even gave me forehead kisses and brought an extra sweater because it was a cold night. When I tried to give it back at the end of the night, he insisted I keep it. To note, I thought it was off putting to make a big deal of bringing an extra ""sweater"" just to give it to me on the first date. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable date.

After that, he kept flirting hard and texting me every morning. We planned a second date and went to his place. The moment I walked into his room, I noticed a polaroid of him and his ex on his desk. When I asked, he said he‚Äôd been cleaning out his wallet and forgot to toss it. This was suspicious and I was weirded out.

We didn‚Äôt do anything sexual ‚Äî just cuddled and kissed ‚Äî but I got really uncomfortable in the middle of the night because my bladder was hurting and I didn‚Äôt want to use the bathroom next to his sister‚Äôs room. He insisted on driving me home, but I could tell he was annoyed.

The next morning, no ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù text, no checking in. He became distant and dry. I‚Äôm a direct person, so I asked if he was upset. He said no, but his energy was  different. After he left me on delivered all day, I followed up by double texting and asking for closure so I can move on‚Äî That‚Äôs when he finally replied, saying we were moving ‚Äútoo fast‚Äù and he wanted to stop.

The thing is ‚Äî he was the one initiating everything fast: the kisses, the cuddles, giving me a sweater, etc. He then had the audacity to ask for the sweater back with a ‚Äúü•∫‚Äù emoji. That‚Äôs when I blocked him and decided not to respond. I felt manipulated and gaslit. The emoji also pissed me off..

In a normal situation, I‚Äôd have returned the sweater no problem. I love when people are honest with their feelings and are communicative about it. But this guy flipped the narrative and blamed me for the pace he set. I genuinely think he wasn‚Äôt over his ex (based on the photo) and jumped into dating just to fill a void. His behavior gave me lovebombing elements, and when something slightly inconvenient happened (like me needing to go home), he bailed??

So now I‚Äôm thinking of donating the sweater ‚Äî or keeping it as a trophy.  I'm open to feedback.

My wife said that given our friends had 2 boys already, that surely there would be more chance of a girl this time. I replied that the 2 boys were not relevant to the sex of the child our friends were expecting, and that there was still about a 51% chance this child would be a boy. 

At the ""gender reveal"", it was announced that this child would also be a boy. Although our friend tried to appear happy at the party, it was clear that she was disappointed that this child would not be a girl. My wife also appeared to be disappointed as well. 

On the drive back home, my wife got angry with me, and said that I ""could have been more supportive"" and that I ""shouldn't have been so mathematical"" with my guess about the baby's sex.  
Edited to add: ""could have been supportive"" referred to my guess that the child would be a boy, and my reasoning for that guess. 

I told her that my response was perfectly reasonable to the questions she asked me. She didn't like that and stayed quiet for the rest of the drive home.

amitheasshole,AITA our friend pretends to be depressed and blames us,0,2025-04-30 22:11:02,8,"I really need a non-biased opinion about this. I am currently in school (14M) and one of my friends I‚Äôll call him lee (14M) used to be a really chill guy when I first met him 3 years ago but since then he started being extremely attention seeking saying things such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so poor I can‚Äôt afford anything‚Äù just to put this into perspective his parents bought him a PlayStation 5 so he could play both Minecraft bedrock and Java so that he can play with his friends of course I somewhat understand his thought process there but the only server he‚Äôs on is on realms so he had no need for a PlayStation. But that was only the half of it he also went around school telling people how depressed he is and at first we where concerned for him but we later realised that he was faking it which pissed off our entire friend group because about three or four people in it have had depression of some sort and some have even gone into therapy because of it eventually it got so far as to one of the members of the friend group let‚Äôs call him jimmy to get into a massive argument with lee during a lesson. So after that he went around telling everyone that he was being bullied which pissed us off even more because two people in our group (me and jimmy) have had some severe traumatic experiences because of bullying so we decided to tell the headmaster about it but he sent us away saying we were being insensitive. But our last straw happened a couple months ago when one of my best friend sadly passed away from cancer and lee said to me that he was happy because and I quote ‚Äúnow everyone is sad and depressed just like me‚Äù and I completely lost my shit telling him to never speak to me again.

amitheasshole,AITA for walking out on my dad and stepmum,44,2025-04-29 16:48:43,21,"Hi. 19m here.

So basically, every Friday I have a ‚Äòmeal‚Äô (fast food) with my dad (53m) at a diner-like place very close to where I live.

For context I‚Äôm autistic and gay/asexual, and my dad has been pretty absent. Him and my mother divorced when I was very little, and he didn‚Äôt really put the effort into things with me and my older brother. He‚Äôs quite immature and stubborn, often believing he‚Äôs in the right.

I‚Äôve learnt over the years to keep things passive with him- a purely face-value relationship. The second I disagree with him, he loses it like a bomb and becomes a toddler.

I‚Äôll try and keep this as unbiased as possible as I do believe that I‚Äôm not just right by default because he‚Äôs an asshole.

So last Friday- me, him and my ‚Äòstepmum‚Äô (his girlfriend that he doesn‚Äôt live with. She‚Äôs lovely but I don‚Äôt consider her a stepmum really) were at the diner we eat at.

He knows I‚Äôm gay, and have progressive beliefs. I came out to him in 2022 and he has a very ‚Äòsweep it under the rug‚Äô view. He was accepting, but did not talk to me about it ever again. He didn‚Äôt mention it, or even ask me about my dating life (whereas he‚Äôd constantly go on about my straight brother‚Äôs).

I basically mentioned to him that I was upset about a recent law in the uk that put a lot of trans people at risk.

He and my stepmum had a terf-like opinion about it, and I began to think ‚Äòmaybe this is one of the times I should drop it to avoid an argument‚Äô but then he started going on about how I shouldn‚Äôt have been so open about my sexuality. He said that no one ‚Äòneeded to know‚Äô. I told him the reason I‚Äôm open is because there may be people in the future who, like me, had no role models and seeing an openly gay-guy might make them realise it‚Äôs okay! 

Well he then went on a bigger rant. He‚Äôs weirdly pseudo-religious, where he doesn‚Äôt go to church but believes he‚Äôs on ‚Äògod‚Äôs mission‚Äô.

He went on about how everyone‚Äôs going to die or something. He knows I have anxiety but it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

I told him I‚Äôm not wrong by default just because I‚Äôm his son, and I told him that I won‚Äôt respect him if he doesn‚Äôt respect me (he was interrupting me a lot).

Eventually I just stood up and left and then walked home.

I was so upset- I‚Äôve never this sort of hatred for someone. I don‚Äôt see him as a father, just an immature man I see.

He seems to think that a healthy relationship with me is a passive one only on his terms.

This argument was the tip of the iceberg. 

I‚Äôve been avoiding him since. Everytime I think of him I get a sinking feeling. He‚Äôs just a tragic man- he thinks he‚Äôs righteous yet doesn‚Äôt do what he preaches. 

Was walking out an asshole thing to do? I apologised to my stepmum for having to see that, but I just couldn‚Äôt be there anymore. I wanted to scream at him but made sure to not raise my voice.

I don‚Äôt really know what to do, and I feel empty and like an awful son. Again, this argument was the tip of the iceberg- I wouldn‚Äôt begrudge someone like that over one incident. "
amitheasshole,AITA For Calling At 8 PM at Night About School Work With My Friend?,9,2025-04-30 01:08:14,33,"Hi reddit, AITA for calling at 8 pm at night?

I (16 F) was calling my friend (17 F) tonight, as tomorrow, April 30th, is our AP Research deadline for our papers (I am a chronic procrastinator, okay?), so I went to my room in order to not disturb my parents. The reason my friend was calling me was because she has a habit of procrastinating on her phone, but when she calls someone (we use FaceTime), it discourages her because she picks it up, and boom, a friend's face. Now I was on call with her for about a good hour, when my mom suddenly called me out to the living room, and when she asked what I was doing, I was honest. I told her I was on call with my friend for our papers, when she got PISSED at me, asking me why I would do that, have I lost my mind, its the ""middle of the night"" and she got mad at my friend too, saying she was a ""bad influence"" and directly asked ""why is she calling you the night before your paper is due? That's the problem with your friends they all want to ruin your grades"" and made me hang up and took away my airpods (which i was using for podcasts to lock in on my paper, because I like having background noise), but I was so confused.

My mom was being really mean and degrading about my intelligence and why I never do well in school (sometimes I ask for help on my AP European History homework) afterwards for a good ten minutes, and I just sat at the dining table to continue working on my paper.

For context half the time I'm not even allowed in my room because my parents don't trust me, but I just felt like she was really in the wrong, and she's been so angry as of lately, so I just came here to vent and see maybe if I did actually do something wrong? I'm a straight A student, I don't ask to hang out with my friends outside of school, (Honestly, I'm kind of an introvert), and I don't sass or talk back, I understand I have to respect my parents and I apologized profusely, so that's the story.

So AITA reddit?

amitheasshole,AITA for cutting the wifi every night at 11 while my cousin stays with us?,2985,2025-04-28 17:41:50,198,"---TL;DR: Started turning the wifi off at night without warning because my visiting cousin wouldn't keep it down while I study for finals. ---

I‚Äôm a 21M engineering student, living with my parents in Lebanon. Finals are in a week, so my nights are mostly spent memorizing formulas and solving circuits.

Last month, my cousin, say Laura, (17F) asked if she could crash in our guest room for a few weeks while she did a short internship in the city (Beirut) from our village down south Leb. My parents said yes, which is no problem, I like Laura.

The problem started on her second night. Around midnight, I heard loud laughter and TV noises coming from the living room. Laura was online with her friends playing online until 1 a.m..
This happened almost 3 nights in a row even though I complained to her multiple tines all respectful and stuff.

After three nights of this, I was exhausted. I haeshly confronted her and she apologized, but the next night it happened again, albeit only till midnight and it was a little lower . My grades are hanging by a thread, so I took a bigger approach shut off the wifi at 11 every night and turned it back on when I wake up next morning, around 7.
My parents don't mind since they're more TV people and go to sleep early.

Cue chaos. Laura lost connection mid-game the first night I did this, and she came to me furious. She said I was acting like an ‚Äúold landlord,‚Äù ruining her only free time. My parents think I overreacted, they say Laura‚Äôs just enjoying her time with us and the stay is temporary. They want me to turn the internet back on and 'ignore her' instead for the sake of family.

The main router is in my room so most control is mine but I have to listen to my parents in the end.

Am I being unreasonable?

I feel bad because Laura‚Äôs internship is only about 2 more weeks, and yes, I didn‚Äôt warn her about turning off the wifi. On the other hand, I'm trying for a scholarship, and I literally can‚Äôt focus or go to sleep with the late-night noise.

AITA?

Edit:
It's 9pm now and I'm getting ready to go to bed in a couple of hours and she's already in our living room playing PS on the TV. I still don't know if I should cut it again tonight because at this point it's like a battle of wits.
On one hand my parents pay for the wifi and she is a guest so we should be accommodating her; but I really tried and mentioned this problem so much.

Edit: it's now midnight - I got my parents to agree that she's pushing things too far and they spoke to her themselves and she's agreed to be pretty much completely quite by midnight - which was our compromise. She's packed her stuff up and is now in bed in the guest bedroom - all quiet, bliss."
amitheasshole,AITA for not making an effort to be friends with my boyfriend‚Äôs girl best friend?,0,2025-04-30 22:35:47,40,"I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (42M) for about 4 months. Early in the relationship, he asked me to move in with him and his mom because I was commuting 2 hours every day for work, and his place is just 5 minutes from my job. It felt like a thoughtful gesture, and things were going really well. That is, until I got a closer look at his friendship with his girl best friend(29F).

Before I moved in, he told me she often comes over to hang out and swim since we live near the beach. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I believe guys and girls can be close friends, and I didn‚Äôt want to be the jealous girlfriend.

But once I moved in, I realized just how close they are. They text literally all day, every day. They have hour-long phone calls every few days. She has stayed over. He has stayed at her place. She buys him expensive skincare and bath products. He keeps Polaroid photos of the two of them on his bedside table, right next to where I sleep. She is also very close with his family.

We have met a couple of times, but honestly, I felt like a total outsider. They had their own jokes, their own energy, and I just went silent because I didn‚Äôt know how to join in. Later, she told my boyfriend she felt like I didn‚Äôt like her. Since then, my boyfriend has really been encouraging me (or pressuring me) to make an effort and try to be her friend. He says it is important to him that we get along.

What makes this harder is that we have gone to a few gigs recently, and every time, he records videos and sends them straight to her. Not to a group chat. Just to her. He never takes photos or videos with me or shares moments like that with anyone else. It honestly feels like she is the one he wants to share things with.

Now her birthday is coming up, and he is planning to buy tickets for an event just for the two of them. He told me I am welcome to come too, but only if I am willing to make a real effort this time to be her friend.

I get that she is going through a lot. Her mom is in the hospital and not doing well, and I do not want to be insensitive. But the whole situation has made me feel so uncomfortable and left out. It feels like I am intruding on their relationship. I have told him this, and he says I am being unfair and insecure.
Am I the asshole for not trying harder to be friends with his girl best friend when it clearly matters to him?"

amitheasshole,AITA for keeping my son away from my mom because she fed him custard?,6484,2025-04-28 14:09:16,4330,"My wife (30s) and I (also 30s) have a baby boy. Last year, we flew across the country with him to attend a family reunion and visit my parents. Things were going well until my wife caught my mom (68) trying to feed our baby custard off a spoon‚Äîagainst two of our clear rules: no sugar before 1 year old, and no spoon-feeding (we're doing BLW). My wife and mom had discussed feeding boundaries at length for weeks, and our 6mo had just started solids.

Since our son‚Äôs birth, my mom has increasingly ignored boundaries. The first issue was her demanding photos at 9am despite our previous ask for no photo requests before 10am. Her reasoning: ""Rules don't apply to Grandma.""

When caught with the custard, my wife immediately took our son and left the room upset without saying a word. I stayed behind and asked my mom why she didn‚Äôt ask first, and she said, ‚ÄúBecause I knew you‚Äôd say no.‚Äù I was livid‚Äîthis showed she knowingly overrode our parenting decisions. Later she tried to brush it off as sarcasm. My mom‚Äôs sister, who witnessed it, validated my wife‚Äôs reaction.

The next day, we sat my parents down to talk. My mom initially apologized but quickly backpedaled, changing details (""It was a fork, not a spoon,"" ""he just reached for it""). Things got heated. My dad said we were being harsh, and later my mom claimed my wife ‚Äúscreamed‚Äù at her. (Neither of us remember screaming but we aren‚Äôt going to gaslight her.) We ended the trip early and pulled back communication‚Äîmy wife, who had been sending daily photos and videos, stopped completely; I now send occasional ones.

We tried working on things. My wife proposed an exercise where they would answer questions about their grandparent expectations and we would discuss them together. We agreed they could attend our son's first birthday if we completed the exercise. They agreed.

After multiple reschedules (due to my wife's postpartum struggles), we finally set a time last minute‚Äîbut my mom refused to get dressed to be on video, saying I ""called every shot so far"" and that she'd just listen off-camera. My wife felt slighted and revoked their birthday invitation. My mom later gave a veiled threat and then a different excuse, but the damage was done and we withdrew further.

After further reflection and therapy, we told them we need them to seek therapy before resuming visits. Their response mentioned the ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù again and uncertainty if ""this will work out""‚Äîbut then still asked for photos ""every once in a while.""

Since then, I‚Äôve kept casual conversation open but deflect photo and visit requests until they start therapy.

So:

AITA for holding this boundary until therapy happens?

Is my wife TAH for ""yelling"" or revoking the daily photos in response?


(For context: they were present at his birth and had two good visits where my mom respected boundaries, which made this breach feel even more shocking.)

It‚Äôs had its ups and downs, mostly typical stuff, but thats doesn't really matter here. I have to keep myself short, so there are some things I left out.

The actuall issue happened a few hours ago, because its my birthday. I HATE my birthday. It‚Äôs connected to some very heavy trauma from my childhood that I don‚Äôt want to talk about, because I'm ashamed and embarrassed, but it has to do with $a and thats all I wanna say. My boyfriend knows this and knows I don‚Äôt like celebrating it, especially not with many people. I‚Äôm fine with spending it with like him or my parents, but I don‚Äôt want PARTIES.

My parents are on vacation right now, so I planned to spend some time with him at my house. I had a doctors appointment before so I told him to wait for me, because he has a spare key to my house since our families are close. When I got home, he was in the hallway and pulled me into the living room, where like 40 people were waiting, including friends, classmates, and people I barely know with decorations, cake, and gifts.

I just stood there and I didn‚Äôt know if I should to cry or scream. He saw I was visibly upset and asked if I wanted to say anything and I just lost it. I started yelling, asking why he would do this when he I hated it. I was crying, almost having a panic attack, and ran to my room and locked the door.

Everyone left shortly after, and he knocked for a while before giving up. Since then, he‚Äôs sent tons of texts and calls, at first apologizing, but then saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot that bad‚Äù and he only did it to push me out of my comfort zone. Then he got angry, calling me ungrateful and saying I embarrassed both of us in front of everyone, even though he was just trying to do something ‚Äúnice.‚Äù

Now I feel shitty... He went through the effort to plan all of this, and I feel like I embarrassed him and myself in front of everyone. But he knew why I didn‚Äôt want this, and he still ignored it.

amitheasshole,AITA for pooping in the women's restroom?,1390,2025-04-28 19:29:17,487,"To make this clear I (25F) am a woman. Using a throwaway cause it's gonna be real weird if any of my coworkers see this. 


Our building wasn't meant to be an office when it was built, so there are two restrooms: one is the men's, which has multiple stalls and urinals, and the other is a single room with one toilet. I think officially the single-use restroom is unisex, but by custom it's been the womens' room. One of my coworkers Mallory (mid30s) sort of claimed it as the ladies' space, replacing the unisex sign with a printout of a womens' room sign. My workplace is very male-dominated, so this layout makes sense to me. There's also a single-room restroom in our workshop next door. 



After covid restrictions lifted I started coming in person. A few weeks passed and Mallory made a kind of rare visit to chat and say hi. She brought up how she suspects maybe some guys are using the ladies stall and asked if I knew that the workshop bathroom was for pooping. I just kind of said ""Oh, really?"" and we both went back to work. A few weeks later, a poo pourri spray appeared over the toilet. Ok, I guess, I use it now and then to be courteous. A few more weeks pass and a container of Potty Mints appear. 


Now, there's only 3 women here, and I feel like these are all really strong hints that I'm smelling up the bathroom. It doesn't seem like it to me - I eat a normal diet, and yeah sometimes after I poop, it smells a little like poop, but it's a bathroom? That's normal right? And I never use the workshop so I'm not sure what to say if people ask what I'm doing around there. ""I'm just here to take a fat shit"" seems like a weird thing to say. But, I'm inherently anxious, and I'm wondering if maybe I'm being too obtuse, or if Mallory is too finicky about bathroom odor.


tl;dr: My coworker has maybe dropped some hints that I smell up the restroom and should use a separate one. I don't know if all that is really necessary. AITA?


Edit: So far the consensus seems that I am fine to use the bathroom in my building. People seem torn on whether it's acceptable to poop without using some sort of product to cover it up. Personally I never do this at home, and I happen to know there's no such products in the mens' room, but I don't have a problem using the ones that are set out. So, maybe my next AITA will be about whether I need to chip in for those

Edit 2: Alright this blew up quite a bit. Thanks to everyone for the input. Between poop-smell-concealing products, kitchen matches, and the courtesy flush, it seems many people have a much more complex and fastidious bathroom routine than I ever imagined, and I'll be adopting some of these practices moving forward. 


And to set the record straight - I'm pretty sure I'm not stinking up the whole office, MAYBE just the stall/entrance area at the very worst (I have a very good sense of smell, just not super grossed out by bathroom smells). But, it's still a shared space so I'll do my best to keep any smells as down as I can. Also, I deeply apologize to any of my coworkers who find this and identify me, it'll be weird tomorrow. "
amitheasshole,AITAH for not realising that someone was trying to park in the last spot in the car park?,24,2025-04-29 18:16:11,29,"So as I drove into my car park at work this morning I spotted a man in his car waiting at the end of the car park. Since he had driven past the only remaining space, I assumed that he was going to leave the car park, so I started driving into it.

As I started reversing, I waved at him to say thanks for waiting, but he was just shaking his head at me. After parking he drives past me slowly, I wave again, but he just stares dead into my eyes, gives me a dirty look and shakes his head again.

Initially, I presumed that he was just annoyed that he had to wait for me to park, but it seems that this was not the case. When I went on my lunch I saw his car parked on the pavement near the car park. That‚Äôs when I realised that I had accidentally stolen his parking space. I have attached a diagram that I made to illustrate our positioning in the car park, and to emphasise that he had driven past the only parking space.

Scratch that, I‚Äôm not allowed to attach anything. Instead, imagine a narrow car park with one row of spaces. At the end of the car park there is a turn off to another site, guarded by a big gate. This turn off is the only way to turn in this car park, and this is where he was sitting. I parked about two, maybe 3 spaces away from it.

Anyway, I work in a relatively small building with multiple businesses, so I will absolutely have another encounter with this man. Should I have realised that he was gunning for the last spot? Or was I being reasonable to assume that he was just turning to exit the car park?

(If you want to see the diagram DM me)

I hope all of that makes sense, Thank you ."
amitheasshole,AITA for going off on my father for complaining about money?,12,2025-04-29 21:11:49,53,"My dad (40M) complained about giving me (17F) money.

When I was younger, my dad was never home‚Äîalways at work. I grew up without him being very present. As I got older, our family drifted apart. My parents divorced, and my brother went to live with our dad while I stayed with our mom. After that, my dad basically stopped talking to me and acted like he forgot he had kids. In a way, I understood‚Äîhe was always busy and distracted.

Later on, I began asking him for money. We lived 17 hours apart and rarely talked. Because of childhood issues, we weren‚Äôt close. He didn‚Äôt help when we really needed it. My mom couldn‚Äôt work due to knee and back problems, and during those times, he never offered financial support. I only went to him when we truly needed help.

This went on for about three years. Eventually, I asked for things I wanted too, not just needed, since I had no other way to get them. After five years apart, we moved closer to my dad and brother‚Äîjust last year. My dad even drove us to our new place. I tried to spend time with him, but he always said he was too busy or didn‚Äôt want to make the hour-long drive.

We‚Äôve now been here a year. He still rarely visits, but when he does, he sometimes spends money on me‚Äîeven when I don‚Äôt ask. I actually stopped asking over a year ago, knowing he doesn‚Äôt really have extra funds. So when he chooses to spend money, that‚Äôs on him.

The other night, I asked him for $50 to buy a VR link box. I had already looked for cheaper options. He said all I ever do is call when I want money. That‚Äôs not true‚ÄîI call him at least twice a week just to ask when he‚Äôs coming to visit. He complained I never want to spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù time with him and only reach out when I want something.

I got upset and told him that‚Äôs false. I do want to spend time with him, but he‚Äôs always busy or with his new girlfriend and her kid. I pointed out he‚Äôs the one who usually doesn‚Äôt want to come see me. I also reminded him that time together doesn‚Äôt have to involve money‚Äîmost of the time, we just want to hang out.

He got upset, said he didn‚Äôt want to argue, and hung up on me mid-sentence.

So‚Ä¶ AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for contacting the council over a disabled parking spot?,1,2025-04-30 09:19:21,42,"Okay, so, I know. Title makes me sound to be the biggest wanker on the planet, and I get it. However, the issue isn‚Äôt about my neighbours having a disabled parking spot. The issue is that it covers over half of the front of my house, meaning I can‚Äôt park in front of my own goddamn house. My mother is getting on in age, god forbid if something happened to her, who would get priority? The neighbours or me? Would I even be able to put in for a disabled parking spot considering it would cover the entire of the outdoor of my other neighbours house.

For the sake of less confusion, I‚Äôm going to call the neighbours on the right the R family. The R family consists of husband, wife and two very young children. Now, I‚Äôm not one to fat shame as I used to be fat and dealt with all the struggles and insecurities it comes with, but I believe R wife is using her son‚Äôs diagnosis of ADHD as an excuse to get a disabled parking spot due to her getting out of breath just walking two doors down.

Now, I get it, you‚Äôre probably thinking I‚Äôm a raging bitch. How could I come to this conclusion? Well, bellow I‚Äôll attach the text message she sent to the road group chat (horribly middle aged vibe with the gc, I‚Äôm aware). Once again, the issue isn‚Äôt the fact that anyone is disabled or needs a parking spot. The issue is that it covers my house, meaning I can‚Äôt park outside my house. It‚Äôs already bad enough on the road, sometimes I have to park right down the corner. However, sometimes we can get a parking spot outside our house which is great when taking cats to the vet, packing the car up for a trip or after the weekly shop. We weren‚Äôt even asked if the parking spot could cover pretty much over half of the space outside my house.

As the title suggests, I‚Äôve contacted the local council about this. I‚Äôm waiting on a response but I‚Äôd like to know AITA, am I overreacting or NTA. 

Text message from neighbour: ‚ÄúHello Everyone, I had a call from the Council yesterday to inform me that they were chasing up the disabled parking bay that they were trying to sort out for our son. So I was a bit confused when I saw cones on the road outside our home last night, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if the Council could operate that quickly post leaving a message. But today, we just returned home and the team are doing it!
So we should be able to park our one car in that area in future and keep our son, who is physically active and has an extreme form of ADHD, away from everyone else‚Äôs cars in future.‚Äù

Edit: I‚Äôm gonna do this in a short list so it‚Äôs just easier to read. 1. The issue was never that there is a disabled parking spot. In fact, I‚Äôm glad the council is getting much better at providing people with the support they need. The issue is that it covers half of their house and half of mine, why not just all of theirs? 
2. My problem isn‚Äôt with my neighbours. At least, my issue with them is certainly not about this. They‚Äôre horrible people and daily we hear Mrs. R screaming abusively at her kids. So yes, I‚Äôm aware I come across as hostile towards them but my hostility is not about this. 
3. I have deleted my email to the council about this as I don‚Äôt want my neighbours to loose the space. Additionally, I also realised it‚Äôs none of my business about why they got the parking spot nor the intricacies of their disability. 

Thank you all for taking the time to comment, I really do appreciate it and it has helped me realise I was wrong in writing the email. 

CONCLUSION: I think I didn‚Äôt label this properly last time but a conclusion has been reached! I deleted my email to the council not long after I sent it. I appreciate everyone who‚Äôs taken time out of their day to comment and I‚Äôve actually learnt more about road rules than I did before which is always useful to know. Thank you all and I hope everyone has a good day. "
amitheasshole,WIBTA for traveling without my friend?,5,2025-04-30 00:03:54,27,"So for Easter weekend, I took a solo trip to Melbourne. It was a long weekend too with Good Friday. We both work for the same airline (but in different bases/cities) so we get to fly free standby (non-rev).

I didn‚Äôt tell him I was going to Australia until he asked me for help. I told him I was heading to Australia and that I couldn‚Äôt help. 

He seemed disappointed and said I wasted my vacation days and how he could have gone with me. He said we‚Äôre friends and how I shouldn‚Äôt exclude him. He then went on to question me why I would travel solo and how Australia should be a trip we should‚Äôve planned together rather than me going alone. 

I explained to him that since he already used some of his vacation days and I hadn‚Äôt, I would have to do some trips without him. Furthermore, he would require a visa while I didn‚Äôt so I figured it was easier without him. 

He then says he wants to go to Brazil with me. I told him that it would be saved for the Fall and he said ‚Äúwhy wait that long?‚Äù. I told him it was because of the weather since their Winter was our Summer. He tried to rebut by saying Brazil doesn‚Äôt get cold. He then went on about how it was on his bucket list but won‚Äôt go alone and that his parents don‚Äôt want to go and his GF needs a visa for Brazil. He then said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs plan to go to Brazil in June.‚Äù

I told him things are up in the air for now. He responded ‚ÄúFine‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs stopping you.‚Äù I said I was planning for Fall and he replied  ‚Äúso? That‚Äôs not binding.‚Äù 

Today, he texted me and asked about potential international trips and said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt go without me!‚Äù Yet hypocritically, when he went with his family to Peru on his vacation days, he didn‚Äôt want me on his flight because he was traveling with his family and wanted seats and said our colleagues would find it weird if I got on the same plane to travel with him. I didn‚Äôt travel on that flight but I find it odd how he thinks he can exclude me but I am not supposed to exclude him. His justification was that I was solo so I should‚Äôve brought someone while he was with his family. 

At this point, I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to take another trip with him. I don‚Äôt think I owe him an explanation for why I travel, when I travel, or where I travel, how I travel.

amitheasshole,AITA for not sharing my notes and class summaries to my friend?,12,2025-04-29 19:15:24,12,"i'm studying at college and every time i have a test, i make summaries of the subject. i have a friend that always asks me to share the summaries i make and the notes i take during class. my problem is that, in every class, she is constantly playing games on her ipad or leaves the classroom for at least half an hour, and that is if she goes to class. she never takes notes and starts studying two days before the tests, in which she only gets good grades cause she manages to pull out her phone during the test and check the summaries others made. i don't want to keep sharing my stuff, because i wake up early to go to class and pay attention, even though i live 1 hour and 30 minutes away from uni and she's just 30 minutes away, and then spend hours reading the classes and my notes to make summaries for the tests, sometimes getting little hours of sleep and barely having free time, all while she does almost nothing. there‚Äôs another friend whom i share everything with, but because she shares her things back, like an exchange of notes and summaries instead of one person doing everything while the other is basically a parasite "
amitheasshole,AITA for encouraging my boyfriend to move out,15,2025-04-29 17:09:03,87,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. When we met, I was in college and he was working random jobs. He started his main career around when we started dating. He lives in his parent's house, and has the entirety of the time we have been dating. I am also living with my parents at the moment, as I am in law school and not working. He makes decent money now, but he does have extra expenses. He was not taught how to be smart about money like I was, and definitely got a late start. However, I am getting frustrated that he is not making efforts to move out. I am incapable of moving out of my parents house right now, as I am in school full time and unable to work. He could move out if he was willing to sacrifice his expensive hobbies or take on more work. He is never willing to put in extra work in the evenings, which is frustrating as someone who works 12+ hours a day with school. Any time we discuss this, he makes excuses and says he wants to move out, but does nothing towards it. He does not save money or ever try to do side jobs. He claims that he wants a life with me but does not seem to be working towards anything. I am in law school and will likely end up being the bread winner, but I do not want to be with someone with no ambition who will depend on me. His lack of moving out makes it seem like he is waiting me to make the decision for him when I can afford a place for us both. A key part of this issue is that he is 7 years older than me. I am only 23. 

Today, we started discussing this and I mentioned that if I were in his shoes, I would be working on moving out, as it is something that I find to be important. I explained that sometimes it seems like I want him to move out more than he does. At this point, it is simply a matter of trying to encourage him to be better and work towards something. I brought up the fact that he swore last year he was working on moving out, but then instead bought expensive gear for his hobbies. He became angry with me and flipped out, saying that I do not know when to stop and that he is trying. He said I upset him and make him feel like he is not enough. I apologized and said I would not press the issue anymore, and what he decides to do is not my business. But am I the asshole?

Edit: We have had a very loving relationship. He treats me very well and makes me happy. We do like each other. I am just the type of person who does something if they want something. I don‚Äôt wait for things to be handed to me. I don‚Äôt think anything worth doing is going to be easy. 

I also want to say that I am constantly having to defend him to my parents and other loved ones and try to convince them he will be willing to sacrifice things for me or be a provider in our relationship. Which I honestly don‚Äôt even think he cares to do. It‚Äôs exhausting having my family consistently see that he does not have a drive to provide. "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if i told my friend i hate her new boyfriend?,21,2025-04-29 15:15:06,34,"I, 27 f, am on vacation with my friend, 27 f, and her boyfriend, 30 m. Last week, me, my friend we‚Äôll call Angie, and her boyfriend I will call Jake went on vacation to the beach. Originally it was supposed to be a trip that included our other friend Tyler but his boyfriend had slipped at work and hurt his wrist so Tyler had to stay home to take care of him. 

Some backstory: Angie just started dating Jake maybe 2 weeks ago. Before then they were friends for about a year or two. Tyler had met Jake many times‚Äî I have only met Jake maybe 6 or 7 times in larger social gatherings. He seemed fine those times so when Angie asked months ago when planning this trip if Jake could come with us neither Tyler or myself minded. It was only 2 weeks before that Angie told Tyler and I that she and Jake had begun dating. Tyler and I both were happy for them as Angie seems much happier than she was with her ex‚Äîbut neither of us were thrilled to turn this into a couples trip.

Angie had told us in a previous meeting with Jake that he gets really overstimulated and that is why he is CONSTANTLY wearing airpods and watching something or is listening to music. The first issue to occur was when we were deciding where to go for lunch. Jake has a pretty severe gluten allergy where he has to carry an epi pen. Knowing this when stopped I first asked him if he was feeling overstimulated as we had just gotten back into the car after stopping to shop in a small towns downtown area. He told me ‚Äúno he was fine.‚Äù I said okay and proceeded to ask him about what kind of places he liked to eat at and what he didn‚Äôt like, because i was going to find us somewhere for lunch. Jake proceeded to snap at me because he wasn‚Äôt overstimulated until someone kept ‚Äúasking him a bunch of fucking questions.‚Äù  This took me by surprise i apologized and explained i had asked questions because i am not familiar with gluten free, i do not know what he likes to eat, and he had said he was not feeling overstimulated. 

My friend Angie said nothing about this. We settled on a Thai place that was close by and things began to lighten up as we ate and continued the rest of the drive though Jake had fallen asleep. 

The second issue I have is with both Angie and Jake. The original plan for the Airbnb was that, since it is 1 bedroom. Angie and I would take the bed and Tyler and Jake would share the pullout in the living room. When they announced they were dating, Tyler and I agreed to let them have the room and we would share the pullout. My issue was that during most of our stay Jake and Angie would go into their room and shut the door not coming out except to get something from the kitchen. A big portion of the trip i spent alone in the living room as I did not want to bother them. 

wibtah if i told my friend i am happy that Jake makes her happy but in the future i wouldnt like to hangout with him and her together. That i dont really like him, and that i think he should have apologized for snapping at me? "
amitheasshole,AITA for eating my own leftovers ‚Äúwrong‚Äù?,300,2025-04-29 00:21:18,265,"Hi Reddit. I‚Äôm hoping you can help me with a serious-but-not-serious issue that‚Äôs honestly starting to wear on me.

I‚Äôm a 39-year-old trans woman (AMAB), married to a 33-year-old cis woman. Being trans isn‚Äôt new in our relationship and isn‚Äôt really part of the issue, but I‚Äôm putting it out there in case people think it‚Äôs relevant.

The problem? Apparently, I eat leftovers the wrong way.

Yesterday, I smoked 4.5 lbs of lamb (7 hours!) and grilled several ears of corn. We shared some with couple friends (enough for them to make a full meal when they made a vegetable side), gave the dogs some scraps, we each tasted a little, and then I left so my wife could host a lamb-and-corn dinner with a friend.

There were leftovers. She packed them into a few containers‚Äîtwo with lamb and corn together (smaller portions), and three larger ones with just lamb.

Today, I forgot my lunch, so I came home during a work break and grabbed one of the small lamb-and-corn containers. It was a modest lunch: about half a cob‚Äôs worth of corn and a few thin slices of lamb. I ate it, got back to work, and didn‚Äôt think anything of it.

Later, my wife asked what I had for lunch. I told her: lamb and corn.
She asked if I made anything to go with it. I hadn‚Äôt, and said so. That‚Äôs when she got upset. She said I should‚Äôve made rice or a grain to stretch it more and that I‚Äôd wasted it by not doing so.

I asked whether she wanted me to eat more food (add rice to what I ate) or eat less lamb and corn and supplement that with roce. She didn‚Äôt want to talk about it after that, shut down, and told me to leave (we had been about to go on a walk before I left for an evening out with friends).

This kind of tension over leftovers isn‚Äôt new. Sometimes it‚Äôs about how much I eat, but more often it‚Äôs about how I don‚Äôt add something to it‚Äîusually rice. She‚Äôs also told me she doesn‚Äôt like when I eat leftovers for breakfast. 

I get that there may be cultural elements at play‚Äîshe‚Äôs Indian, I‚Äôm Black‚Äîand I do try to be mindful of cultural differences. But these aren‚Äôt Indian meals. Most are things I cook (like the lamb) or leftovers from eating out‚ÄîChinese, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. I didn‚Äôt grow up eating rice with every meal, and in my household, meat or stew often stood on its own.

We‚Äôre not low on food. We‚Äôre not tight on money. It just feels like no matter what I do, I‚Äôm not eating ‚Äúright‚Äù in her eyes, and it‚Äôs honestly draining.

So, Reddit, AITA for eating lamb and corn for lunch without adding rice?"

amitheasshole,AITA for never mentioning to my GF that my teeth are not real.,6866,2025-04-28 07:12:40,1045,"Hello!  
That is burner account, reasons are obvious.

I 38m had problems with my teeth since I was a teenager, by the mid 20s I had done so many root canal treatments that my dentist recommended me that in the long run it would be cheaper and less painful to get permanent dental implants, as I had constant issues with my teeth!

I did it - they removed all my real teeth including few that did not cause issue jet and I got implants.  
Suddenly there was one constant annoying thing less in my life, that eventually I forgot about it.

3 years ago I met my current girlfriend (34f) and we have been living together for a year.  
Recently she had problem with one teeth and found out she need the root canal treatment and told me ""I wish I had such good teeth as you!""  
And I realized that she does not even know and jokingly told - ""Oh those are not mine, I got those in 2013!""  
Suddenly she was mad that I kept such a secret for all that time from her, that I was hiding the truth!  
I tried to explain, that I am so used to it that I just don't think about it.

She think that I am an asshole and that is a lie of omission.  
Of course she got some of our friends included into that discussion and some agree that it does not even affect her, some thing that people should tell those things.,

AITA?  
Note: I am not asking any kind of advice here, I am asking does forgetting to talk about such detail makes me an asshole."
amitheasshole,AITA for not confronting my friend who is jealous of my other friend's boyfriend and excluding her silently?,11,2025-04-29 18:06:53,28,"I (F,27) have a 2 close friends, lets call them Anna (F,31)and Bella (F,27). Anna recently had a boyfriend. Anna's boyfriend is Bella's longtime friend. Bella introduced him to Anna. She was their matchmaker. However, it was obvious that she didnt want them to be couple from the beginning.  She even tried to hook me up with him first. I didnt want to meet him. But it turns out he wanted to be so bad with Anna that he nagged her everyday so she could introduce him to Anna. Then, they finally met and match made in heaven. They hit it off. 

Thats where things get messy. Bella passive agressively insults Anna time to time about this relationship. How Anna is older than her boyfriend (M, 28). Bella told the boyfriend that Anna had many failed relationships that were about to be marriage. In her words, she wanted to protect Anna from getting heartbroken again. But she is the one who introduced him to her. Whenever he is mentioned in the chat, she passive aggresively insults him or her. She tries to make Anna jealous by talking about other girls that boyfriend works with. Bella also told Anna's every personal details to boyfriend. Anna had a fight about it but Bella subtly tells boyfriend everything like it wasnt a big deal. She looks very innocent and naive while doing it so you cant be mad at her at the moment. 

It feels like Bella wanted to be with him and kept it as a friend for a long time. But now he is with another girl, she realized her mistake and wants him to herself. Therefore, Anna is mad, like MAD MAD. She excludes her from our dates. She passive aggresivelly claps back at her for no reason at any time. Like even if the topic is not related, she insults her subtly. I am stuck in between. They dont confront this issue since it would make their relationship break apart. I also cant say anything since its not my place. But I feel like a hypocrite when I talk with Bella. She is clueless that Anna is mad at her and we dont invite her to things, kind of excluding her. 

I dont take sides but siding with Bella is almost impossible. I somehow understand her little bit because she is recently broken up with her boyfriend and she is in her trying to find a new life path phase. She is depressed and needs a friend. Thats why I cant cut ties with her even though her bitter actions. Regardless, I still cant side with her because jealousy is so obvious. Also, I dont side with Anna, because if I side with her, things would be worse. She goes beyonds when she is angry so I am trying to keep the balance in the group. I am silently waiting for things to resolve. I also feel like a hypocrite for not talking about this but I am not sure if we openly talk about this, how things would go down. I feel guilty. 

So AITA, for excluding my friend and not communicating about her jealousy so she would know whats the problem?"
amitheasshole,AITA for leaving a bachelor party early?,39,2025-04-29 10:32:40,107,"My (26m) friend (26m) is getting married this fall. This past weekend he invited me and a couple other buddies on a bachelor party. We all know each other from being on the cross country team together in college. We are all still very close, but we obviously see each other less than when we all lived together.

So the plan for a bachelor party was a hike. He picked a location that was between a 1 and 3 hour drive for all of us (I was about two hours away). It was just going to be a day thing and then we say our goodbyes.
However we realized on the hike that it the first time we've all been together in two years. One guy got the idea to keep the party going, saying he could quickly find an Airnbnb. We could go out for dinner and drinks that night, sleep over, and then leave in the morning. Of the 10 of us, I think 8 of us (including myself) decided to stay, and 2 people went home.

Well when researching things to do, the restaurant and bar seemed too nice to go to in our sweaty hiking clothes. Though we didn't want to buy new wardrobes, we figured we could at least wash our clothes in the machine here, and then dry them. We didn't have spare clothes with us.

We all agreed, and it became clear the guys were just going to pregame together in their boxers/underwear until their clothes were good to go. I didn't feel comfortable with that but needed my clothes washed, so said I would hang out in one of the bedrooms until they were ready. My friends got weird and asked if I was really not going to spend time with them. I said I would when we went out, but I was not going to pregame with them, as I wasn't comfortable.
They thought I was the AH because they said I was ruining the vibe and we've seen each other like that from being on the same team. I said I didn't think it was a big deal to take a couple hours to myself after having the whole day together. They clearly didn't like my explanation so I ended up deciding to just drive home and skip it all entirely. I've heard through the grapevine the groom isn't thrilled.

So: was I the asshole?

amitheasshole,AITA for Messaging my bf's parents?,3,2025-04-30 00:01:05,5,"Hi, My name is Elaine (30) not real name, and my boyfriend is Elle (38) not his real name as well. I work as a teacher for kids with extensive needs and though it can be challenging sometimes, yet it is the most rewarding thing I ever done and I feel so complete catering to their needs and make me feel purposeful and accomplished. 

I met my now boyfriend 6 months ago. When I met him, I fell for his gentleness and being present in my difficult moments. We have good laughs, and was able to get introduced to his family. we were able to travel different places together as we both find joy seeing different things. he was honest with me that he has OCD, and I am fine with it. I have seen him manifesting different forms of OCD and I made sure to give support whenever he needs it. Yet, all of these fell in different way that I had expected. I was physically, emotionally, and verbally hurt whenever I fail to meet his needs. Throughout our relationship, I have been patient to him. had always believed that it's because of his OCD that's why I cannot hold him accountable of whatever action he will do.

I tried so hard to study his behaviour like my caseload to understand him better and to make sure that his needs for understanding is met. But all I got is him being defiant and disagreement. Last weekend, he did something again to me that broke my heart so much as he yelled at me, and say mean words. And I cried so hard that it felt like the time went super slow and I just wanna drag the day so I can go home. His parents are very loving and doesn't have any idea about his OCD and what's going on behind.

I decided that night to break up with him and told them what's going on, I poured my heart how much I love their son and I dont want anything bad to happen to him in the future if he continues to do these things and not seek help from the right people, All my intent is to them guide him, and make sure he's being look after because i am afraid that one day, if continues to do so, he'll be in place that they would never imagine. But everything turned upside down. I was blocked by his parents and no one believed in me. My bf's is telling his parents that it is all not true and every i did is just me creating drama. I am so lost and I dont know what to do because no matter what I say, he says i have no right to tell anyone especially his parents, and i broke trust and by passed everything. IATA for this?

amitheasshole,AITA for not spending enough time with my best friend/roommate,9,2025-04-29 19:23:26,15,"

okay so i (22F) and my best friend (23F) started living together in october. i got into an official relationship with the first boyfriend I've ever had in january. I was in a situation in college, where my roommate's boyfriend basically lived with us and it was uncomfortable, so l've always been very conscious to not be like that with my boyfriend and respect the shared space. me and my best friend have been best friends since high school, and ever since living together I see her more than I see anyone else in my life (naturally).

more recently, we have been going to the gym every day together, finding new trails and going on walks outside, in between our jobs we would see each other and sometimes eat together, and sometimes we would cook dinner together and watch shows at night. we also grocery shop together and are always taking the other when we go to stores for small things. I don't think we go out formally a lot, but I spend a lot of time with her and that still seems like quality time to me because it's always fun when we are with each other and i'm happy that we get to live together and do most everything together in our 20s.

so with my boyfriend, I don't see him every single day and he's only spent the night a handful of times but he does come over maybe a couple times a week (3 at the most). we also go out and do things too so when i see him it doesn't necessarily mean he comes in the apt. I personally thought I was in a great position to be able to see him a lot, but still not feel like I'm missing out on time spent with my best friend. apparently she does not think so because recently she says that I have been selfish and canceling plans with her to hang out with him. we don't really make that many plans outside of the house so l genuinely don't know what she's talking about, and when I asked her what plans I have canceled, she ignored me. she also says that it's disgusting to come home and hear us have sex (this has happened 2 times) and that I'm and that I'm being inconsiderate and ignoring her asking me to play music or turn the tv on. the walls in our entire apartment complex really are so thin and i definitely have tried to minimize the noise bc that's embarrassing for her to hear that in my opinion so i would never be loud on purpose. but the most recent time she wasn't at the apartment and came in the middle of us having sex and that's when she got mad for the final time and stopped talking to me."
amitheasshole,AITA for telling the DJ at a friend's wedding reception to cut the video?,1912,2025-04-28 12:22:45,181,"The title sums it up, more or less.

I (33M) was officiating my friend's wedding (30s). It was a civil ceremony so wasn't like any religious tying of knots. And it was great, which continued into the reception - there were food, drinks, speeches, the works. Then about an hour in, we were suddenly asked to sit at our tables because the bride's friend & groom's sister announced they were going to play a video they produced. So in principle we all knew it was coming - we were all asked to record a message for the couple, and indeed, we assumed the video would be just a lightly edited compilation of those messages. 10 minutes or so? Oh how wrong we were, how very wrong...

So every 3rd message or so was interrupted by a message from either the friend or the sister. They grew longer & more elaborate, but also... very boring? OH hey, here' the sister going down a slide. Here's the brother driving a car... Now they're at an amusement park! It's a jet ski! And each elaborate shot ended with one of the two looking at the camera going ""congratulations! We love you!"". This felt a little egocentric tbh, and not abotu the bride & groom at all. And it dragged ON - the thing lasted like 20 minutes, and the crowd was getting restless. But hey - it was finally over, right? WRONG

Oh no, when the messages were over, and the ""credits"" rolled, it was suddenly time for a skit! And by skit I mean a terrible pilot episode of a sitcom that never had any right to exist. The sister & friend were pretending to be the couple, and there were... jokes? I think? It was torture. It was hell. I was in hell. I was paying for my sins. I was being punished for watching Friends one too many times. At minute 38 of this hell I, slightly drunk, got up, walked up to the DJ, and went ""No! that's enough! Cut it! Play music!"" The DJ seemed genuinely relieved to be given the go ahead, and as the music started playing, the groom's sister ran up to me going ""No! What did you do?! There were only 15 minutes left!"" to which my reply was ""Are you kidding me?! ANOTHER 15 minutes?! Fuck no!"" and went off to dance. According to my friend the sister tried to get the DJ to resume the video, but by this point the dance floor was packed and she flat out refused, god bless her. 

So now my friend's sister refuses to attend any event to which I am invited, but honestly? Screw her. Taking over the entire wedding with that video nightmare? She had it coming. Still - my friend agrees the video was absolutely unhinged, but says I Should have just endured, and not have been so rude to her, which IMO she earned with her magnum opus of crap. So... AITA?

Edit for info: the couple despise the video. The groom thought I should have been nicer to his sister about it though "
amitheasshole,AITA my gf is obsessed with cats,35,2025-04-29 09:00:08,50,"Lately my gf and I have been having problems with me not doing enough for our cats. 
When we started dating a year and half ago she only had 4 cats, which I loved because I‚Äôve always wanted a cat but could never own one as my stepdad had an allergy to them. 
Anyway as time went on I discovered that she has always been a huge cat person and she regularly catches cats from the street and finds out if they are owned outside cats or strays. If they are owned she‚Äôll take them back to the owners house and if they are strays she‚Äôll look after them before taking them to foster care. This was something I actually liked and helped out with as much as possible. The thing is though that this went from an irregular thing maybe once every two months to every couple of weeks. Which now meant that I had to help look after these cats along with her current 4. Also in this time we rescued a stray cat who I fell in love with and ended up adopting. I love him so much but then we had 5 cats. 
As time went on she moved into actual fostering cats from various pounds through an organisation. She‚Äôs now particularly interested in fostering pregnant cats and kittens which means at a time we may have over 10 cats to look after in the household. She puts all of her self into these cats and I live and respect that but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm as interested in as her as I have to spend a lot of time at home working on my job and other important things that every person has to deal with. I‚Äôm finding it really hard to keep up with all of that and put the effort in with the cats. Again it wouldn‚Äôt be such a problem if it wasn‚Äôt so many cats to look after but over 10 at a time is way to much 

Now that that‚Äôs all out of the way, I need some advice on if I am the asshole for not wanting to be as involved with the cats as she is? Is it reasonable for me to say to her ‚ÄúI love that you want to do this and I support you doing it but I can‚Äôt contribute as much as you with the responsibility of all these cats‚Äù .
I love the cats and I love her but this seems to be getting out of control and she won‚Äôt listen to me at all. I say to her that I‚Äôm not as interested in fostering and looking after these cats as much as her and i wouldn‚Äôt mind if she wanted to do this separately as a hobby of hers but she wants me to be directly as involved as she is. In her mind it‚Äôs either I leave or I stay and spend all my free time looking after all these cats. "
amitheasshole,WIBTA for taking lost Lunar new year money that hasn't been collected?,15,2025-04-29 13:39:29,36,"So I'm facing a moral quandary. I work in a library at a quite expensive private school that has a lot of that come from wealthy Chinese backgrounds. Around 2 months ago I found a red envelope under the shelf as I was putting books away. I assumed at first the envelope was empty and left over from Lunar New Year, but I looked inside to find that it still contained some notes - over $200.  It didn't have a name on it. With normal lost property - bags, water bottles etc. I place it into a lost property box which is put out on display for the children to look through at the end of the term if it is not collected. I asked my boss what to do and she said put it in your desk drawer and hopefully someone will realise they lost it and come ask if anyone has seen it. 

Well, they haven't. If there was a way of identifying the person who lost it I would of course give it back, but since there isn't, I feel like my workplace will just take the money eventually when it's not collected, but I'm not sure. My boss didn't point to a specific policy around this and she hasn't asked me about it again. I'm kind of feeling a bit Bilbo Baggins ""After all why not, why should I keep it?"" and want to just take the cash for myself and never bring it up again. 

But stealing is wrong, and it's not like I'm destitute, all though the money would mean more to me- an adult with bills to pay- than to a child without responsibilities who received it at the end of January. But I could be making excuses to do the wrong thing, and I should bite the bullet and hand it in to the admin team or something, on the off chance someone will collect it.  WIBTA if I take the cash?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if i tell my friend to stop trying to fix her old friendship,5,2025-04-29 20:44:16,8,"Hihi! first post on a burner account

I (16F) have two friends, i‚Äôll call them cassie (16F) and Adam (16M) we all go to the same school. 

Cassie and Adam became friends almost two years ago by now, as we were all in the same class.

I met Cassie three years ago, while I‚Äôve known Adam for 5ish years (friend of a friend scenario)

Cassie and Adam had a huge falling out, and as Adam described it 80% was his fault. 


The issue starts after they stopped being friends. Cassie and our friends assigned Adam a code name, calling him Juice Box. (code name also changed bc Cassie is on reddit). she‚Äôd also complain about him to any of our friends (that weren‚Äôt super close with Adam). I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want trouble.

Additionally, she‚Äôd speed walk everytime she saw him, sometimes even turning around in a hallway. Eventually (i thought) she had gotten over it as she stopped talking about him.

However, she mentions that she wants to reconcile with Adam (after ghosting him, running away from him). I think this is a bad idea but whatever.  She does this in a strange way. On Adam‚Äôs birthday, she finds him first thing in the morning and gives him a pack of JUICE BOXES (because of the code name) and talks about how she wants to be friends again. she told me after that he looked suprised but happy, and he told her he‚Äôs glad she doesn‚Äôt hate her anymore.

The gift thing was half a year ago, and I thought they were chill now. However, me and Cassie usually pass by him while walking from one class to another, and him and I usually wave to each other. Cassie told me a few days ago that he doesn‚Äôt wave to her when she waves to him (when i‚Äôm not there) and she thinks he‚Äôs being rude.

Both Cassie and Adam also come hang out with my main friend group during lunch (on their own volition) but Cassie mentions that Adam barely talks/acknowledges her while she‚Äôs there.

I really want to tell her that she should just let sleeping dogs lie, that he probably doesn‚Äôt want to be friends with her again, knowing what she said about him and how she acted before they reconciled. I just don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs upset that he doesn‚Äôt want to be friends with her. 

However, i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs ok to tell her that, because i‚Äôd be criticizing her behaviour during a bad time. I also don‚Äôt want her and our friends to hate me ): "
amitheasshole,AITA for letting my boyfriend‚Äôs 4-year-old sister try to be independent?,565,2025-04-28 17:05:53,125,"So, a bit of background: I (F22) have known my boyfriend, Kai (M22), since we were in preschool. We were friends but fell out in early elementary school literally just because he told me that Santa wasn‚Äôt real, but we reconnected in high school and started dating in college.

I‚Äôve known his family for years and mainly interact with his mom, Nicole (F40s), his older brother, Dante (M24), and his little sister, Luna (F4). After a working on a group project at the library, a storm passed through and instead of taking me back to my place, Kai took me to his family‚Äôs house since he still lives with them and I‚Äôve spent the night before.

After dinner, Luna asked if I‚Äôd supervise her bubble bath before bed. Nicole said it was fine, so I agreed. Luna wanted to be a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù and insisted she could undress herself, so I let her try. Well, she got the shirt halfway off but got stuck‚Äîher arms were still in the sleeves and the shirt was caught behind her neck. She panicked and started screaming and crying.

Because of the amount of noise Luna is making, Nicole, Dante, and Kai come rushing in. I had just gotten the shirt off without hurting her but Luna was still upset, crying. Dante immediately starts yelling at me, demanding to know what I did to Luna. I tried to explain, but before I could say anything else, Kai told me it was best if I just leave.

So, I walked home in the rain and am now questioning if the family overreacted or if I shouldn‚Äôt have let Luna try to be independent and big.

amitheasshole,AITA For making fun of my bully‚Äôs dead dog and not apologising?,0,2025-04-30 16:08:06,28,"Our beef started long ago, when he broke my bag in school and he talked behind my back with my friends. Sometimes I made small retaliations, showing I wasn‚Äôt afraid of him from gestures like ‚Äúfists‚Äù, and then eventually we kind of made up, he paid me back for my bag when I asked him to, but he also manipulated my crush to reject and ghost me, which then our beef reignited. He mocked my relationship with my crush for being emotional, so I told him to go to hell, and I mentioned his dead dog subliminally. Honestly, I have planned to apologise but whatever I‚Äôve done he‚Äôs done back to me, and he and his friends have been bullying me for a year since with threats as well. I want to apologise because I own a dog as well.

Edit: if you have time I‚Äôd like to DM to discuss what I should do, cause I also have problems with other people as well"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to pitch in on home repairs,6,2025-04-29 17:23:16,39,"I (33M) was in a long-distance relationship with my partner (42M) before deciding to move to live with him in his house in a city 600 miles away. My living situation before moving was this: I was a co-owner of a home with my long-time roommate and best friend. We bought the place together and split all costs including mortgage, utilities, and HOA dues 50/50. When I decided to move, we discussed what this meant for the house. She was not ready to sell or relocate simply because I decided I was ready to move out - totally reasonable - so I stayed on the mortgage and I pay 50% of that still as an investment property. She still lives there and pays 100% of the utilities and she took on all the HOA dues which are $600 alone.

Move forward and I've now been living with my partner for close to a year. Things are going great. He has invested a lot of money into his home so it's comfortable and optimized and I love living here. I pay 50% of all the bills here - electric, internet, and I pay 'rent' in a way, which is half of his mortgage. We're not married and I'm not on the mortgage.

We've talked about how this home we now live in is an investment for our future together. And the home that I am still investing in is too. The end goal here is to eventually have one place that is equally and truly ours.

But I am currently spending 3x more each month on mortgage payments than my partner is and it is much harder for me to save and pay for surprise bills. When I moved in, my partner's cost of living was essentially cut in half because of my contributions. Recently, when the water heater was having problems, he said that we would split the cost of the repair. I live here and I use water and everything else but my hope was that my covering of half the mortgage was contribution enough to help with the repair.

I would never ask my partner to contribute to a necessary repair to my investment property. Is it any different because we don't live there and it wasn't his choice for me not to sell it when I moved out? After leaving everything behind when I moved, I thought it only made sense to keep it as a nest egg.

I am too close to the situation to know who is right here. Our end goals are aligned but it feels bad knowing that my partner lives cheaper than me, can save more than me, is paid more for his job than I am, and I am having a harder time keeping up."
amitheasshole,AITA for standing next to a guy,2,2025-04-30 02:48:26,15,"a little lengthy but pls read !! 

I became good friends with a girl‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúS.‚Äù Throughout our friendship, she casually talked to and flirted with multiple guys (no judgment) just want to emphasize that she was single. at parties she often danced and flirted with this one guy named ‚ÄúJ‚Äù at parties. they never had a talking stage but she did admit she had a huge crush on him way before we became friends but now she laughs at the idea of liking him bc he‚Äôs cringey and self absorbed. I agreed with her takes and personally had no interest in him whatsoever (attraction wise) 

At one party, while she was seeing another guy, she danced with J as usual. J made small talk with me and randomly added himself on my phone even tho we followed each other already and then made a sexual comment about my body. I gave him a side-eye and moved on‚ÄîS saw this and didn‚Äôt care. i made sure to communicate with her and told her immediately; regardless if she saw herself. 

Months later, at another party, she was single (not talking to anybody) and dancing/flirting with J again. Her family and a former best friend she‚Äôd just reconnected with were also there. At one point, I was pulled aside to let one of her family members talk to her old friend. I ended up standing near J, dancing on my own and not engaging with him at all. i did not look in his vicinity nor did i acknowledge him. i did not dance on/with him. i did not touch him. i did not kiss him. i did not hug him. S looked over, smiled, mouthed ‚Äúyou two,‚Äù and I replied, confused, ‚Äúfuck no.‚Äù we were both intoxicated but i would remember if i did anything with a guy. 

The next day, she told me we shouldn‚Äôt be friends because I was near someone she was dancing with. her reasoning was that I as her friend should shut down any type of nonsense and that, according to her, her family and old friend agreed with her. She said I should‚Äôve shut down even being in his presence. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not leaving my 11 week old baby to go to a bachelorette party during Mother‚Äôs Day weekend?,209,2025-04-28 21:22:10,140,"I (28 F) just gave birth to my second child toward the end of February of this year. My friend (28 F) is getting married this May and I am a bridesmaid in her upcoming wedding. My first child is also a flower girl. 

My friend decided that she didn‚Äôt want to have a bachelorette party earlier this year to avoid drama with a younger sister who has bad BPD. My friend‚Äôs older sister is the MOH and decided a couple of weeks ago that she was going to throw my friend a surprise bachelorette party. The only weekend that worked for both of them is Mother‚Äôs Day weekend, and my friend‚Äôs sister told all of us that she understands if not all of us can go. 

My son is only going to be 11 weeks old at the time of the party and is mainly breastfed. He also has bad reflux issues at times, and can be hard for others to deal with. The bachelorette is also 4 hours away from home and it‚Äôs hard to justify even a day trip with a LO this small.

Well last night my friend found out that I can‚Äôt go and was really upset about it. I explained to her how much I truly wish I could be there, but I am unable to right now due to not being able to leave my son for that long yet. My friend basically told me not to talk to her anytime in the near future and that she will see me at the rehearsal dinner. 

AITA for not being able to go? I really wish that I could, but my kids are always my first priority. I don‚Äôt appreciate her making me feel like a bad person for needing to be a mom. I will say that this friend has a bad history of needing to remain in control and likes to take things out on me when things don‚Äôt go her way. This might be the last straw for me, however, and I‚Äôm not sure if I even want to be in the wedding anymore.

amitheasshole,AITA for not yielding someone crossing the road,6,2025-04-29 17:38:28,15,"This post is not super dramatic or anything, but I wanted a second opinion. I work downtown in a city, and on my way out of the work parking lot, there is a small road. I go down this road to turn right onto a busy street. Right where I need to make a turn, there is a huge wall blocking my view of the busy road, so sometimes I have to pull out a little bit where people cross when they are using the side walk. Usually I pause before this crossing and wait to make sure nobody is coming, and then I pull into it to make sure I can turn. I did this today, and I was waiting for about 30 second to make a turn. While I was waiting to make the turn, a bike came zooming down the side walk, and the guy riding it started yelling at me and hit my car with his fist as he went around me. Normally, if I notice someone approaching, I back up a little bit, but he was coming so fast I did not see him. I did my best to ignore him while he was yelling at me, because I did not want to make the situation worse. He left, and luckily there was no damage to the car. I also think it is worth noting that bikes are not aloud on side walks in that part of the city, but he was biking in the sidewalk really fast, which is why I was not looking for him. So AITA, and what would you guys have done differently?"
amitheasshole,AITA For buying an ambulance in the suburbs,11,2025-04-29 13:35:45,55,"I (25M) just recently bought a 2009 international lp4 (ambulance I'm converting to a camper) and have it parked outside my house (I live with my parents and their ok with it). I'm doing my best not to block the road to the best of my ability (half of it is on my grass). And it's only been a day, and two (2) of my neighbors have complained but didn't have a specific reason. 

We'll call them Nate and Carl. Nate lives across the street from me and is a friend of my parents. They've had friendly relations until the last few months. Carl lives down the street from me (about 5 houses), and we try to keep our distance from him. Nate making complaints about the neighborhood isn't new he usually finds something despite doing the same thing himself. Carl has been making jokes about my truck to my father (not sure what he said, but my dad could tell he wasn't joking) and has sent pictures to him as well.

My issue is that no one has come to me with their issues, so I can help rectify them and instead wanna be passive-aggressive with my parents. While space for cars has been an issue on the road, Carl has a driveway and only 2 cars that aren't blocked. I just don't like passive-aggressive behavior and people involving my parents like I'm a rebellious teen.

The situation is new, so I don't know what everyone is saying about my truck, but I wanna know, am I the asshole here?

amitheasshole,AITA for suing my sister over our dad's estate since I only just reconciled with my dad?,642,2025-04-28 14:54:00,178,"Two years ago, I had a falling out with my father that resulted in him altering his will to cut me out. I imagined we'd never speak again, but some family members organized an intervention that led to my father and I reconciling this past November. Dad I and attended therapy together, came to terms, and we both agreed neither of us were happy with cutting the other off.

Late in February, we lost my father, and so I'm deeply thankful that we did manage to reconcile and reestablish our relationship. In all sincerity, I know I'd be depressed as hell if my dad had died with my last words to him having been what they were.

Several times leading up to this, dad had said he would be reincluding me into his estate planning. He had brought this up not only with me, but with friends and family, and his attorney as well. Dad obviously did not expect things to go the way they did, so his will remained unaltered, with my younger sister receiving everything.

My sister ""Jessie"" is actually one of the people who worked to get dad and I to reconcile, and she was aware of his intent to write me back in, so I thought there'd be no fight. However when I mentioned the idea of dividing the estate fairly between us, she became defensive and pointed out that the will was written to leave everything to her at the time of dad's passing, and since dad did not change his will, she cannot know for sure that dad did not want her to have everything.

I feel she's being selfish. I've tried to sit down and talk with her, making significant compromises as really I'm fine with her keeping his savings and home. I only want an AMC Eagle dad and I had restored together several years ago along with some gifts I had given him and a 50/50 split of his vacation cabin that Jessie doesn't even like. Jessie refused to hear me out. She said she plans to give the car to her husband's nephew, and even though the gifts I gave dad have almost no value, she wants to retain them.

I spoke with my dad's attorney who told me that I have a solid chance to dispute the will as there's a significant number of people (himself included) who were aware of dad's intents. Dad had also sent me text messages talking about his intent, as well, which at least included his desire that I should have the car. My dad's attorney would not represent me, as he believed it may result in conflicts, but he did introduce me to another estate attorney who's taken my case and is equally confident.

Jessie is furious. She says I'm selfish and that me spending a couple months with dad following nearly two years of quiet doesn't entitle me to anything. A few family members have joined Jessie, insisting I should accept this as my punishment for the extended fight I had with my dad in the first place. But the majority of our family is standing with me, and Jessie's own husband has said her behavior is problematic, although I've encouraged him not to speak with Jessie and I don't want to see friction between them.

AITA?

  
EDIT: To answer a couple questions that have come up.  My father and I stopped talking to each other in 2022 following his separation from my mother.  I let mom stay with my family during the separation and dad saw it as me taking sides.  He threw out some vulgarities, I threw some back, and that was that.  I did allow dad to see his grandchildren while we weren't on terms because I didn't think it'd be fair to them to lose their grandpa, but he just sort of opted not to.

My dad's passing is unfortunately due to an overall bad lifestyle.  Although dad was only fifty-six, he was having a lot of trouble with simple activities and been refusing to listen to his doctor.  I do believe a large part of his motivation to reconnect with me was that he felt his time coming, and I am genuinely thankful that we had that opportunity.

Jessie and I actually always had a great relationship.  Even now, I'm not angry with her at all.  She barely talked to dad either, mostly because he tended to spend his time with her shit talking our mom and I, but obviously she was still there for him for the past couple years."

She‚Äôd already planned for us to go out for dinner and drinks with them, then come back to ours afterward for a games night. I asked why she set all that up without running it by me first. 

I mentioned that when it comes to having people over, it‚Äôs only fair for both of us to agree. I mentioned that I‚Äôve got things on during the day Saturday and was actually looking forward to a quiet evening to unwind as I'll be pretty tired.

I suggested we hold off and plan something with them next time they‚Äôre in town since they're back pretty regularly, but make sure it‚Äôs at a time that works for all of us. She wasn‚Äôt happy about that and said it was just one evening, and she didn‚Äôt think it was too much to ask. 

I told her that if we‚Äôd talked about it ahead of time, she wouldn‚Äôt be in a position where she‚Äôd have to cancel.

She thinks I‚Äôm being unreasonable and said it‚Äôs her right to have her friends over sometimes, but I told her that any guests should be something we both agree on. I wouldn‚Äôt make plans to bring people back here without checking in with her, and I don‚Äôt think she should either.

When I was younger she took her issues out on me, and constantly tried to wind me up, we argued every single night and I couldn‚Äôt understand why. I struggled with my emotions in general and she never helped and made everything about her, I thought she genuinely hated me, this lasted until I was about 13-14, we still argue now but less because I tend to just ignore her. My dad knows but I believe chooses to ignore how bad it was because as he usually says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just on new medication and she has her ups and downs‚Äù which, I understand however I believe she uses this to excuse her behaviour.

She came in not long after saying that I‚Äôm selfish and I don‚Äôt appreciate things she does for me (she buys me a thing every other month so if we do argue I apparently can‚Äôt tell her she‚Äôs a bad mother, because she bought me lunch the other week) she sits down on my bed and bawls her eyes out saying she feels I hate her ect, and she just wants me to talk to her, I then explained how this isn‚Äôt my fault, she ruined our relationship, I was always trying to fix it as a kid, but I‚Äôm tired of it. we‚Äôve had this conversation multiple times and it‚Äôs good for a week and she goes back to normal.

For context, my one niece is 4, and the other is 2 months old.   
  
For example :  
  
Me:  ""Hey, what do you think of this video?"" or ""Rate this song, I think you might like it!""  
Sis: ignores what I send, doesn't even ackknolwede it in the text back, and just replies with about 30 or so pics and videos at a clip of videos and pictures she took of my neices. 

I understand she is busy, but it makes me feel like she isn't even looking or caring about what I send her, or that I want her thoughts on something. I hope this makes sense. It feels like it's never a 2 way conversation. 

In a somewhat joking matter, the next time she does this I thought about replying ""that's cool just ignore everything I send you lol jk"" or something like that. 

WIBTA if I replied to one of those texts like that?

Any suggestions on how to handle this situation a bit better? I just feel a bit upset because I feel like she doesn't even care about what I have to say, and just always wants to send me tons of clips and pics of her daughters (who I DEEPLY love btw and I love seeing them when she sends them!).

Thanks!"
amitheasshole,AITA for not chipping in for Easter Meal,50,2025-04-29 02:21:55,36,"AITA? Okay so me (24f) and my Sister (27F) share a property at the moment she decided to tell me that she is hosting a Easter party and invited 20+ people. Okay no problem but now she is trying to send me a bill and pay for part of the Easter food but I didn‚Äôt even invite a single person to this event. I did help cook, clean, and set up. It was never mentioned beforehand that I would be paying for half of the food until afterwards. Am I the asshole for refusing to chip in on cost of food?"

When I checked my left cabinet to find the bottles and cans I had for multiple years, gone. I called my mother and asked what happened, now mind you. I cleaned and rinsed these items before I ever put them in my cabinet. These cans and bottles are rare sodas and tea‚Äôs three of the bottles I got from New Mexico. She told me she threw them away for smelling of mold. (I complained a bunch over the years of my room smelling rancid. I‚Äôm a 26 year old M) So I let it slide as I do, but as I got through more days. I got more and more mad. Those were my prized possessions; and she threw them away without telling or asking me. So I complained to family members, in front of her. She got mad at me about how ridiculous this was. So AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after neighbors complained?,8833,2025-04-27 22:23:44,2359,"I bought a house a couple years ago and I have been working on making it look nicer. I spent a lot of time redoing the front gardens, trying to make it neat and nice. 

I a few weeks ago was at a greenhouse buying some plants for the garden and I saw two yard flamingos marked down on clearance. I knew they belonged in my garden. They‚Äôre not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I think they‚Äôre a lot of fun. 

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they‚Äôre ‚Äúextremely gauche‚Äù and ‚Äúlowering the property value of the neighborhood‚Äù. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn‚Äôt going to be hurt by two yard flamingos. I also don‚Äôt live in an HOA and as far as I am aware, there are no town ordinances about yard flamingos lol

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor. 

I like them, I smile when I see them when I pull into my driveway. I have no plans to take them down. 

AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after some neighbors complained?

Edit: everyone keeps suggesting garden gnomes. I kinda hate those a lot üôà but also I‚Äôd never say anything to someone with a yard full of gnomes. But I won‚Äôt buy them. "

I told my mom and dad about this plan at dinner when my girlfriend wasn't there and I thought they were going to be overjoyed because they both really liked her my mom saw her as a daughter she never had but after I told them my plan my mom was furious with me and called my girlfriend a tramp who didn't deserve me I obviously didn't take this well and asked her what her problem was and she then said ""I don't want that fucking tramp stealing you from me"" then my dad started to try and get us to calm down but I then told her to fuck off and try to be happy for me because I've found the love of my life while being young and that she shouldn't be jealous because she had already had a divorce by my age. She then ran out the kitchen crying and calling me an evil son and that my girlfriend is an ugly disgrace that she didn't want in the family. My dad then shook his head at me and ignored me while we finished dinner.

So am I in the wrong I think she blew up for no reason but my dad seems to side with her.

So me (alice 14f) my ‚Äúex‚Äù friend now (sasha 15f) have been friends for 6 months we became friends from Natalie (Nat 15f) she introduced us we became close friends than they had a big argument (i wasnt apart of it) and sasha told me to stop talking to her cuz she‚Äôs horrible and all that shit (for context sasha has never been the greatest to me she was always mean and almost never nice always ‚Äúthird wheeled‚Äù me with my best friend emma (15f) example: once we were out the three of us me emma and sasha we were in a shopping mall and she smokes she was always ‚Äúemma come smoke with me alice u stay here‚Äù she did this like 4 times that one hangout my bsf emma always said ‚Äúcan we go back i dont like when alice is alone out there‚Äù sasha responded ‚Äúomg just one more minute shes fine i dont wanna go back‚Äù (it was like 15min but ok)) so back to the drama sasha lately was really mean like more than usual and keep in mind i havent talked with nat for like 4 months and something about sashas story about the drama with nat was weird it never made much sense so i decided to text nat i know that was kinda a shit move but what did i have to lose a bad friend? Nat explained the whole situation it was totally different from sashas she just victimized herself and kinda was and is an attention seeker back to the story so nat explained the situation to me and i decided to tell sasha that i texted her she was really pissed long story short she said that she wants nothing to do with nat and can‚Äôt be friends with anyone that is friends with nat (I wasn‚Äôt even friends with her i just texted for the explanation) so we ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù ig like were not friends anymore

amitheasshole,AITA for not eating the birthday cake my boyfriend got me?,5547,2025-04-27 22:57:16,1118,"  Alright so my birthday was a couple days ago and I asked my boyfriend like a week before to get me a carrot cake. While I know its not a popular choice for a birthday cake, it's my favourite and practically the only flavour of cake I like (besides red velvet but I wasnt feeling it tbh.) Keeping in mind that I was gonna have a birthday party with my friends, my boyfriend suggested that I get a ""flavour that people like"", which I'd understand maybe if it was a huge party with tons of people, but I know MY friends and I know they wouldn't  mind carrot cake at all. (edit: should clarify, I told him that my friends would be fine with carrot cake and to get it anyways)


  Anyways fast forward to my birthday, my boyfriend goes and gets the cake from the shop in the afternoon and I dont get to see it since im getting ready, but he doesn't mention anything to me about it, so i think nothing of it since i like a surprise. My friends arrive and everything's going great until its time for the cake to be served. We gather around the table and everyone sings happy birthday while my boyfriend brings out the cake, and to my horror, i see this big chocolate cake in his hands. I hate chocolate cake. It makes me sick. He KNOWS I hate chocolate cake. 

  My face fell when I saw it but I obvs didnt say anything at the time. However, I did give my bf a glare or two, which he clearly picked up on since he kept insisting I eat the cake infront of everyone as we were serving it out. Something about that made me angry in the moment and I refused to try the cake at all. I cut it, i blew out the candles, I handed it out to eberyone, but i didn't try it myself. 

  I dont think the others took huge notice but once the party ended i started getting unready when my boyfriend comes into our room and is lile ""why do you have to act like a child all the time??"" And im like what the hell and hes like ""you have to make a scene just cos i didn't get your fucking carrot cake"" and he went on about how nobody likes carrot cake and how im spoiled and selfish and looked stupid not eating cake at my own birthday and then claimed he couldnt find carrot cake which is crazy cos 1. Ive never not gone to that shop and NOT seen carrot cake, and 2. even if there wasnt any he coulda picked ANY other flavour, besides the only one I hate. 

 I told him that and he just got really upset like I was the one who started the fight and started going on abt how I was overreacting over cake and how he tried his best to make this bday good for me (which in fairness is true since he put a lot of effort into organising it for me) but honestly I was just livid then. Now we're still kinda off about it and neither of us have lile apologised or anything but im starting to think i did overreact over cake and I probably shoulda just eaten it and then talked tochim later but idk üò≠

amitheasshole,AITA? I accidentally told his girlfriend everything,228,2025-04-28 15:38:42,39,"So, last year some time I met this guy who's maintained that he's been single and will continue to be.  
He made it clearly understood that he was seeing multiple people. We began a casual relationship of sex and communication, more like FWB.   
He later opened up to me some of the things he's into sexually, like group sex, threesomes, hot-wifing etc. so we even started doing some of those things, even up to this year. He'd express feelings but I knew he wasn't someone I'd strongly date. We would have little fallouts where he'd be jealous after he'd bring people or very iffy about what me and persons might share. A common theme being women he would bring would ask me if I knew he was bisexual, when I'd mention or ask him about this he'd flip out and somehow tell me I'm the one always speaking on weird things or tarnishing his name.. which confused me.   
Anyway, we continued doing our rendezvous and once a woman popped up at his place and we left together, he opened up its a married lady he's seeing and he doesn't understand why she's a;ways on him like that if she has a husband/ 

Well.. hold on tight for this cause it gets strange  
So one time he and I had been out the whole night and came back to his like 11:30am the next day where I came for my car. As I went in my car, a car pulls up and he tells me to just leave. So I did.. its the woman I leave it alone, later he calls me and says while we were gone she destroyed his place.. I found that strange, he still maintained he's a single man.

I let it be.. a week or two later I had went in a beauty salon and saw the lady, I gave her a compliment and kept it going. I didn't know she and my service provider were besties. She reached out to her and asked her to ask me some things, which I answered. I said, I don't date him, we just smash and he's a single guy no stress and plus I don't think he's 100% straight. Unbeknownst to me, this was his girlfriend of over a year who's 13years his senior and funding his life and she saw me coming out of HER car she lent him. His girlfriend confronted me on the phone afterwards, upset I didn't know she existed, I kept it straight with her, I said hun there were absolutely no signs he had a girlfriend. She told me, he sent her a photo of me before asking if she'd be into a threesome, I didn't know this. But I think thats why she was so upset when she caught me with him. She also said she's been separated from her husband for 3 years and currently divorcing

She confronted him, he told me I was an evil destructive person trying to ruin his life and destroy him. He blamed me for embarrassing and hurting her and told me I was extremely fucked up. I feel really bad about it, I couldv'e said nothing at all, but I really didnt know.

Am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for typing too loudly in the library?,0,2025-04-30 10:20:31,40,"So this is actually the second person to come up to me this week about it so I am slightly questioning my position on this.  
I have quite long acrylics and type quite fast so I can kind of understand it but I tried paying close attention to my typing and personally I think I sound pretty normal, definitely above average volume but only slightly, however I may be wrong if people are coming up to me.

What am I supposed to do in this situation?

I'm obviously not gonna get rid of my pricy nail extensions or go out of my way to buy a silent keyboard that I don't want. I am perfectly satisfied with my MacBook.

Do I move across the library? I feel like thats unnecessary as if i was bothered by someone in the very large library we are in I would just move across because its just me thats bothered and that person is not going out of their way to annoy anyone.

My friends also don't think I've done anything wrong but they may be saying this because they are my friends.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that its only two people that came up to me and they are both friends and they have each only come up once. I feel like I sound way worse if I don't make this clear.  
Wow there are a lot of people that think I'm the AH. I've been coming here for a while and have never been told anything. And to those saying I sound insufferable I suppose I do. But honestly I have struggled my whole life with being a pushover and am working on boundaries now. The meek little girl in me is telling me to leave but I feel like I'm letting the young me down if I do. Hence, looking for an explanation why if you're gonna call me the AH because I don't get it. I would've moved if I was bothered."
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friend she‚Äôs pathetic and embarrassing,148,2025-04-28 17:29:47,57,"my friend and i, close since middle school. she had a bf for 5 years, broke up 3 years ago. cheated on him, said she needed to see what else was out there. she wasn‚Äôt good before that. 

she told him he must be gay as he didn‚Äôt like having sex with her (she would make fun of how he did things, how horrible he was at it, etc DURING SEX) - one time she called him gay in front of me and laughed in his face. got into screaming fights with his mom over her treatment. he doted on her. 

her lab partner. got very close with him, hooked up multiple times. told ex they were just friends and she kept crashing on his couch? he called bs, they broke up like a week later.

month after, she texts him saying how much she misses him, how sweet he was, etc, eventually he responded to tell her to stop. she spammed him, ‚Äúi guess we just ignore each other‚Äôs existence now?‚Äù etc. 

9 months later, we‚Äôre out at a bar. she sees him walk in, with another girl. she went to the washroom. i go to the bar for another drink, they were nearby. i turned, he introduced her. she was kind. my friend finds me again and i told her leave them be. he kisses the new girl. my friend ran over screaming at him. no response from either of them, they just left. 

then he blocked her. so has his mom. she keeps trying to message them. she keeps all of the pictures of them up on her socials, ‚Äúshe stalks me it‚Äôll upset her, she‚Äôll tell him so he‚Äôll have to unblock me to get rid of them‚Äù. which, has not happened. it‚Äôs been 3 years since they broke up. pictures, still up, makes fun of her, constantly.

the girl from the bar, they‚Äôre engaged now. she found out last friday. ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just doing this to make me jealous, i‚Äôm all he cares for not this bimbo‚Äù, etc. 

our friend group had plans to go out (stadium before a game). we go, they‚Äôre there. fianc√©e went to get a drink from one of the stands, alone. my friend saw this and was off. she proceeded to tell her he was using her, she‚Äôs ugly, he‚Äôs hers. his fianc√©e grabbed her drink, smiled, and walked away. my friend came back over, said now he‚Äôll have to speak to her. the rest of our group agreed and supported her. she asked why i was quiet. pissed off, i told her that she was embarrassing and sounded pathetic, she treated him horribly, she has no right to act the way she has been, she needs to move on. (also are you not embarrassed to have old pictures with a guy posting his engagement photos with another girl talking abt how in love with her he is?)

no one from the group has spoken to me since, she yelled at me for not being a good friend, rest of the group agreed with her.

i know i still believe those things, her ex and his fianc√©e didn‚Äôt seem upset. so maybe i didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúgo to bat‚Äù. i know she‚Äôs having a hard time, not dealing with it well. maybe i owed her more grace during her lows.

i don‚Äôt know. but none of my friends are speaking to me now and my sister said i was out of line"
amitheasshole,AITA for yelling at my father and making him cry?,52,2025-04-28 22:36:19,37,"This just happened not even more than an hour ago, so please excuse me if my tone is rather jumpy. I‚Äôve never posted one of these before, but I‚Äôve been listening to them a lot so I guess now I have something to say.

My (18) father (55) is in the midst of a very arduous divorce with my mother (42). It‚Äôs been a months long struggle, and I‚Äôve somehow ended up as his go-to vent buddy.

I know why my mom is divorcing my father; he‚Äôs been an incredibly hard worker and provided myself and my sister (7) with everything we need and a bit more sprinkled on top, he‚Äôs been a great provider but‚Ä¶

As a dad though? Not great.

As a husband? Even worse.

A frequent desire to control every aspect of my mom‚Äôs life and thing‚Äôs I‚Äôd consider borderline financial abuse all resulted in my mother‚Äôs decision to begin the process of divorcing him in January. I‚Äôm sure her finding out about his bad sports betting habit didn‚Äôt help sway her mind. I liked to think he was making progress despite still not moving out ‚Äî he began seeing a therapist and going to church (highly debatable on how helpful that was though‚Ä¶).

It hit a breaking point this morning. My father began with accusing my mom of making porn in her locked bedroom (keep in mind, my 7 year old sister has been sharing the bed with my mother while she recovers from surgery). That already pissed me off in the morning, but when I got home from college he started telling her that the only reason she was doing this was because of her ‚Äúbitch friends.‚Äù

I confronted my father after this in the backyard shed that he turned into an office. I began asking him to please stop disrespecting my mother. I won‚Äôt be self-effacing, I did reach the level of a yell at a certain point, but I was not insulting him. I told him that I loved him, and that it hurt me to be angry at him, but that I would not allow him to disrespect my mom. Ever since I was a child he would always tell me ‚Äúdefend your mother from everyone and everything, regardless of whether she‚Äôs right or wrong you defend her.‚Äù And now I was. 
He starts choking up and says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, I get it.‚Äù I let the silence sit for a few more moments. ‚ÄúThe whole world just kicks me down. I‚Äôll leave now fine it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù And so he storms out of the office, packs his bags, starts dismantling the whiteboard and his desk. He handed me the keys to the house and with lungs full of spite he said ‚ÄúGoodbye OP.‚Äù

I had to leave to go pick up my little sister‚Äôs medicine, but I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôll be gone by the time I‚Äôm back. Regardless of how scared I am about rent and just surviving without my father‚Äôs economic support, I also feel terrible. My mother says I did nothing wrong, and that I am not responsible for how he responds to my feelings, but no matter how angry I am it doesn‚Äôt feel good to make my own father cry.

None of my friend‚Äôs are available to call, so I ask you all: am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my brother's girlfriend have one of my cupcakes??,3207,2025-04-27 23:52:39,320,"ok so like last weekend my mom threw a little family get together at our house cause it was her bday. nothing crazy, just cousins and stuff. i decided to bake cupcakes the night before (i'm not a professional baker or anything but they came out super good tbh).

anyways i made like 24 cupcakes and put them out on a tray on the counter. i specifically told everyone that they were for after dinner because my mom wanted to do a candle thing with them instead of a regular cake.

so my brother (he‚Äôs 22) shows up with his girlfriend, who nobody really knows that well cause they been dating for like 2 months? she‚Äôs nice i guess but a little pushy. like she acts like she‚Äôs already part of the family or whatever. idk.

fast forward, we're all just hanging out and i see her just straight up grabbing a cupcake off the tray. i go over and i‚Äôm like ""hey can you pls wait till after dinner? my mom wants to do candles with them"" and she kinda just stares at me like im crazy and goes ‚Äúit‚Äôs just one.‚Äù

i said ""yeah but they're for later"" and she literally rolled her eyes at me and put it back... after taking a BITE. so now that one‚Äôs ruined obviously.

my brother got mad and pulled me aside later saying i was rude and made her feel unwelcome and ""it‚Äôs not a big deal"" but like?? it wasnt just about the cupcake, it was about the whole plan.

my mom said i didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but some of my cousins said i shoulda just let it go cause ""family first"" and now my brother‚Äôs still being weird with me.

so idk. AITA??"
amitheasshole,AITA for disagreeing with my wife who gets annoyed when my parents compare my daughter to me,69,2025-04-28 20:34:21,174,"I have a 1 year old daughter and my parents are visiting from oversees (Canada) . 

My parents make comments through out the day about how my daughter either looks like me or behaves like me. 

My wife gets really annoyed with my parents always comparing my daughter to me... Because it's her daughter too

I got irritated with my wife's reactions and she said I need to acknowledge her feelings even if I don't like them. She said it's very common for mother's to feel like that and I can go ask her/our friends etc. 

For additional context:
- wife gets annoyed with my parents staying over for a month. So there is definitely some underlying stuff there 
- she hates thaty parents talk about me (I agree but they definitely are not malicious or ill intent with her . There is just very little common ground)
- my parents can be overbearing which I agree with her many times . But this i just don't understand 


Today wife made several snakry comments when 
-  parents bought my daughter `daddys favourite girl' ...of course your parents bought her that 
- parents compared my daughters tantrum to when I was a child/baby ...she said all babies throw tantrums 
- my aunt video called and made similar comparisons ...wife got annoyed and was over it 

Edited the additional context. 
- they give her attention but she doesn't like their attention and finds it over bearing and not interesting. They can't seem to find common ground so mom mainly just converses to her about me which she finds even more annoying.  I seen mom try to make Convo many times with her but it goes no where - not to anyones fault they are just very different
- they have stayed previously for longer and we went to therapy on this topic . We agreed together that one month is sufficient . I have nanny etc so wife doesn't have to do any work or support my parents when I'm at work. However I do understand that there is the whole mental and emotional side of parents just being there all the time 
- given everyone is focusing so much on my parents staying which is a problem we are trying to figure out with professional help ..My wife reacts with similar comments   even when she/we go to Canada and see my parents/family . When she visits them , she gets annoyed that most of the conversation revolves around me. I thought this is very normal because her parents conversation revolves around he. She complains much more about them to me versus them complaining or saying anything bad about her to me . "
amitheasshole,AITAH for smoking weed on my balcony?,0,2025-04-30 03:49:11,28,"Hey all, kind of a little dilemma here. I (29m) live in what would be a 2 floor duplex with my gf (25f) and I live on the 2nd floor.  My only outside area would be the patio/balcony I have. The downstairs tenant swears he can smell weed smoke in his home when I don‚Äôt smoke inside at all so maybe it somehow makes its way through his windows below me? I don‚Äôt smoke often and I have already spoken to the landlord about it and they are understandable as I live in a state where it is 100% legal. After my landlord spoke to the downstairs tenant regarding how he decided to approach me drunk out of his mind, I decided after work today to take one puff. Not even 10 seconds after that hit I can hear the neighbor (who is buddy buddy with the tenant downstairs) yelling from his driveway saying ‚Äúno one wants to smell that‚Äù ‚Äúhurry and move out loser‚Äù ‚Äústop disturbing the downstairs tenant‚Äù. I sat in my chair and didn‚Äôt say a word as he couldn‚Äôt even see me from where he was. Keep in mind the downstairs tenant has fed the neighbors lies about us no doubt in retaliation to me having the landlord speak to him about confronting me inappropriately and saying I‚Äôm banging around on purpose. All lies of course, we have better things to do with our lives than make noise on purpose for someone we don‚Äôt care about. Keep in mind as well this downstairs tenant is a guy in his 50s who lives with his new wife he just had a baby with last year. I‚Äôve done what I could to mitigate possible smells inside by adding air purifiers all  around the home and blow the smoke into an air filter when I go outside to smoke. What was first a little annoyance that I thought was resolved once the landlord spoke to him now turned into a hostile environment from a neighbor I‚Äôve never even spoken to before. The landlord is now going to be talking to the owner of the house because this isn‚Äôt the first time the downstairs tenant has done stuff like this with previous tenants before me. Unfortunately the downstairs tenant has signed for 2 more years and does help the owner of the home with small projects with landscaping and small construction/home improvement projects. AITA for smoking a bowl of weed every once in a while on the balcony outside in a state where it is legal? We keep to ourselves and do our best to stay out of peoples way but I had to call the landlord and tell him about this incident because i don‚Äôt know how else to go about it. I use disposable vapes most of the time and very rarely smoke actual bud. The downstairs tenant is sort of a big redneck type who downs bud lights like it‚Äôs water and chain smokes 3 packs of cigarettes a day, even the landlord tells me it‚Äôs baffling how someone his age who smoke cigs could complain this much about weed smell, but somehow my weed smoke is what ticks him off. Any insight besides to just move out would be great also. AITA for getting my landlord involved and trying to live peacefully? Thank you.

amitheasshole,AITA for confronting my roommate about wanting to lay on the couch in my own living room?,12,2025-04-29 04:54:19,15,"I (23M) live with 3 roommates. One (22M), Matt, is someone Ive known since elementary school. We went to high school together, briefly dated, and now we're friends.

For context, In Nov 2024 we planned a New York trip, but Matt mostly hung with other friends & it sucked not being a priority when we'd gushed over this trip together.

Jump to Jan 2025: Matts birthday weekend - boardgames one night, drinking the next. I was on the tail end of a cold but wanted to join because hes my friend, and his guests are also my friends.

Matt told me to stay in my room so I wouldnt spread my cold, claiming he hadnt told guests I was sick (it ""slipped his mind"") I was 90% better and definitely not contagious - no one in our apartment caught it. I agreed, but my room is closest to the living room, so I heard everything. They used my Switch and my jackbox games while I couldnt even walk to the bathroom without ""infecting anyone."" -Matts words

Second night of the party, I tried joining again but was refused. I questioned why he hadnt told anyone I was sick, but he brushed me off. Later, our friend Lisa visited my room sounding WAY sicker than me! She said I was ""a saint"" for not spreading my cold and admitted she ""probably shouldnt be partying."" I wanted to storm out and take my Switch since they were still using it, but just said, ""I'm in here, but not of my own volition.""

About month ago, I sent our roommate chat a message about feeling unwanted. Matt has a partner and our other roommates are dating, so theyve got each other. My therapist said people don't know how you feel until you tell them. The couple sent apologies, Matt hugged me, I thought we were good.

Now Apr 2025: I asked to play the new RuPaul Clue and was met with maybes from everyone. Later on I was laying on the couch. Matt texted asking to use the living room & Switch with his partner. I said ""Sure when?"" and he said in an hour. Later I texted I'd just be on the smaller couch while they used the TV.

Matt replied they wanted a ""special date night"". (news to me but ok) I explained I thought he meant using the TV, not me leaving. I work late 5 nights weekly and rarely get apartment time. He said he wasnt asking me to stay in my room, just wanted the living room.

""Where else would I go? The bathroom?"" I asked. Our apartment is open concept its all living room. He confronted me saying he ""never asks for the living room"" then walked away. I txted that I don't usually stand up for myself and that I couldnt see the problem with just sitting quietly in the corner. But I caved: ""I'll leave. You'll play for hours, go back to your room, and we wont play Clue. Feels like I'm being punished for wanting to socialize & use my own living room."" I then mentioned being banished during his party.

Matt: ""You were sick.""

I finally got to say: ""Lisa was sick but got to partake.""

He dryly responded with: ""Thanks for letting us have the living room.""

I'm questioning why I keep being treated like this... am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,"AITA for relocating a squirrel that was damaging my garden and property (unaware my neighbor considered it her ""pet"")?",62,2025-04-28 20:16:31,66,"Hi, recently, I made the decision to humanely trap and relocate a squirrel that had been causing significant problems on my property. It wasn‚Äôt just digging in flowerbeds, it also chewed through outdoor electrical wiring (a real fire hazard) and broke multiple bird feeders. This squirrel cost me hundreds of dollars, hours of my time, and a lot of stress.

Gardening is personal for me. It‚Äôs been major therapy after losing my mom to ALS. It helps with my grief, anxiety, and depression.

Before trapping, I tried everything: repellents, barriers, natural deterrents. Nothing worked. Relocation became my last resort. I released the squirrel safely into a wooded area with dozens of walnut trees a few miles away (still within town limits), where it would have plenty of food and shelter.

Here‚Äôs where things spiraled:

One neighbor (let‚Äôs call her Cathy) is furious because she had been feeding the squirrel for five years and considers it her ""pet."" She‚Äôs now posting about it all over Facebook ‚Äî her profile picture is literally the squirrel. I had no idea she felt this way.

Another neighbor (Tom) accused me of ""killing her babies,"" claiming the squirrel probably had a nest nearby.

For the record:

* No one has verified there was a nest. No one can even tell me where it supposedly is.
* Based on my state‚Äôs wildlife timelines, if there were babies, they would have been old enough to leave the nest.
* I had no malicious intent. I acted to protect my home, property, and safety while still respecting the animal‚Äôs well-being.

The squirrel is black, which makes it stand out to neighbors. I get that people enjoyed seeing it. But our town is full of squirrels, you can barely drive a few blocks without seeing several flattened on the road.

Tom also said the squirrel likely died after relocation because it was ""unfamiliar territory"" and ""probably got eaten by a predator."" While that's possible, it's also part of the everyday risks wild animals face.

Some neighbors are also attacking me for ‚Äúrelocating a wild animal‚Äù ‚Äî while many of these same people hunt and fish. I have no issue with that (I respect people's rights), but it seems hypocritical to criticize me for safely relocating wildlife while personally killing it for sport or food. You can't pick and choose when interfering with nature is acceptable.

Tom also implied I‚Äôm not an outdoors or nature lover. Honestly, that offended me. They don‚Äôt know me at all. I care deeply about the environment:

* We compost.
* We‚Äôre pescatarian (mostly vegetarian).
* I plant native plants for pollinators.
* I refuse to use harsh chemicals on my lawn.
* All of our vacations revolve around National Parks.

It‚Äôs frustrating to have my character judged by neighbors who never asked my side.

Still, with the way some people are reacting (tears, public shaming, dramatic accusations), I‚Äôm starting to second-guess myself.

**So: AITA for relocating a squirrel without realizing it was considered a ""pet,"" and without confirming a nest?**"
amitheasshole,AITA for wearing my best friend‚Äôs boyfriends shirt,11,2025-04-29 05:59:55,27,"So the entire academic year my best friend stayed over at my dorm 90 percent of every week,. I loved having her over she was like my roommate. she recently got a boy friend and he also stays over with her every week. He‚Äôs friends with me and my boyfriend so I thought it was fine since they stayed in the living room.  As time went on they started to use all my clothes and items and leave me with the chores  most of the time. I cook, clean and study while my best friend just ‚Äústudies‚Äù. I asked for help many times but obviously they shut it down saying they wanna cuddle or they need to study. Recently when I did the laundry there was a shirt I found in my load of laundry and it was very comfortable so I started wearing it. Turns out it was my best friend‚Äôs boyfriends he saw me wearing it and pointed it out. My best friend told me not to wear it anymore because she likes it more and got extremely upset that I wore it. What irks me is that they both wear and have countless of my clothing. So am I the asshole for wearing my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs shirt ?

Update - 
I told her exactly how I felt and gave her an ultimatum that either she pays rent and helps with chores or she leaves and figures it out for herself somewhere else. And she got really upset and said she won‚Äôt be staying over anymore but atp that‚Äôs a blessing in disguise. 

I‚Äôm terrible with confrontation and fear conflict but you guys are all right and I appreciate your honesty

amitheasshole,AITA for not co-signing a friend‚Äôs condo lease.,933,2025-04-28 04:47:54,213,"My friend was a SAHM, her husband was the main breadwinner. With the economy not going so great, she is now looking for a new job. She planned to move back to our home city and has been looking for a place to stay. 
She found the ‚Äúperfect condo‚Äù for her to rent. But because her husband and her credit score is not so great the owner told them that they would need a co signer. 
They also have a little bit of debt, I think something like 15-20k of credit card debt. And they also purchased a new truck in 2024. 

She asked me, and I told her I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable taking on another co signing situation as I signed on for my dad‚Äôs truck in 2023 which is still being paid off. My husband and I are also waiting to purchase a house maybe in a couple of years so we also want to keep that in mind.
But on top of it all I have always learned not to co sign for other people. 
I trust her and I would lend her money or take care of her kid, but I feel that co signing for a condo especially when she doesn‚Äôt have a for sure job lined up nor does her husband makes me weary?

Now she‚Äôs mad at me and her mom texted me saying I‚Äôm selfish.
Her mom can‚Äôt sign for her because she recently filed bankruptcy.


Edit: thanks to everyone who has responded. Majority say I‚Äôm NTA, but I woke up to crappy texts from my friend. She was whom I would consider to be my best friend at the moment too. We‚Äôve known each other for 5ish years now. But she basically texted me saying how she‚Äôs disappointed as she made me her sons god parent and this is a disappointing way to be a godparent since I‚Äôm not willing to just provide my signature. 
I told her it‚Äôs not just a signature and I also have to think of my toddlers too. I mean we aren‚Äôt living out of our means and my credit score is great because I worked hard on it. 
She went on to say some more things like now she has to ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù and look for apartments because of me vs being able to live in a condo. lol. But honestly I‚Äôm not sure if she would be able to get an apartment either because their credit score is less than 550 and apparently her husband who‚Äôs 1099 has not filed taxes in over 3 years. "

one night we are all closing and working together to get everything out, and i‚Äôm having a convo. my coworker(20M) comes up and i ask if im in his way, where he, mid me talking, snores thru and pretends to fall asleep while im talking. then does it again. okay, i reply with ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre making me like you‚Äôre generation less and less.‚Äù (which ~okay~ we are kinda the same generation, but he was in school for covid and i was an ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù and those two mindsets in a work place are quite different)

alright so now my coworker comes back with the age question and then the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre literally the same generation‚Äù and then kinda just puffs out air like im dumb and blows me off.

now that was our own encounter. i left it feeling kinda like a jerk for what i said, but also, feeling disrespected for no obvious reason other than an attempt at being the funny guy. well just you wait! there‚Äôs more.

amitheasshole,WIBTA if I didn't attend my sister's wedding?,2,2025-04-29 17:44:31,63,"My youngest (22) F, sister pity invited my husband (27) M and I (27) F to her wedding in August and we are SERIOUSLY on the fence about going. 

My sister planned this wedding out last year and didn't mention it nor invite us until the last minute in April.  The only reason we knew about it is because we creeped online and found the event on the Knot. She asked my other sister to be a bridesmaid and my brother to be a groomsman but didn't ask me to be apart of the wedding party. Although I'm a little distraught about that situation, we aren't super close thanks to my narcissistic mother constantly stirring the pot. 

Today she messaged me asking if I was going and if I received the invitation which gave me a little glimpse of hope that she actually wants me there and cares but nope, I was wrong, she only texted me and asked if she could borrow my wedding dress for a prank at their wedding, I lied and said it was in the attic stored away when in reality it's in my closet. I don't want my wedding dress to be ruined in a prank, I'm still married that's some BAD juju. 

Another reason we are on the fence about going is she has some unreasonable beef with my dad stemming from 2 years ago. He basically cut her off financially because she not only disrespected their house rules and themselves but because she's an adult with a child that she needs to be responsible for instead of partying every weekend and leaving her kid with everyone else to take care of. She didn't invite him or ask him to walk her down the aisle which doesn't sit right with me or my husband. I have beef with my mother because again she's a pot stirring narcissist that speaks for itself, but I still invited her to my wedding. 

We are also on the fence about attending because my mother's insane narcissistic family is going to be there and we CANNOT have an event or gathering with them without feeling like shit about ourselves, they constantly start drama. We haven't spent a holiday with them since 2021 the last time we seen them and kind of avoided them was last summer at my brother's graduation.

I feel like I'll regret not going and let my siblings down again but, my husband and I don't want the mess, or disrespect and we feel for my dad he hasn't seen his only grandchild in 2 years. I'm really hung up on the line here and not sure which decision to make. Would I be the asshole for not attending my sister's wedding?

amitheasshole,AITA for correcting mispronounced words.,92,2025-04-28 16:39:51,202,"Just now, my wife was mispronouncing a word. I interjected and corrected her, and then in the very next sentence she said it the wrong way again. So I corrected her again. Now she is very mad at me and says I'm too critical of her. 

AITA for correcting when she says a word wrong? Should I just forget about it knowing she will go around to friends, colleagues, etc saying words incorrectly? When I'm in her position and mispronouncing a word and she corrects me, I see it as helping me not embarrass myself, not as criticism. If i have spinach in my teeth I want to know.

Maybe correcting the second time was the mistake? To me it seems like she did it on purpose, maybe knowing it would irk me, maybe I should have just let it go?"
amitheasshole,AITA: Half-sister Won't Reschedule Visit,24,2025-04-28 23:59:40,36,"My mother-in-law is elderly, has some health concerns, and lives with us in Alabama. She once lived with my husband's half-sister in Massachusetts, but after three years of causing chaos and arguments between the half-sister and her husband, my MIL was asked to move out. She came back to Alabama, and she's lived with us since 2020.
She does have health concerns, but she also has a history of overmedicating and being really inactive. She barely moves from her lift chair during the day. She only follows doctor's orders if it involves taking a pill; otherwise, she does little to help her own health situation. 
Today she informed my husband and I that my husband's half-sister and her daughter will be coming to visit in June. I immediately said that I'd be recovering from surgery, and asked if they could delay the trip for a week or two. 
She said that their visit wouldn't interfere because they'd be staying in a hotel, and they'd rent a car and come by each day to take her out to do things. 
Again, this is a woman who isn't active, and when she's tried to get out and do things, she tires easily. Because of that, it is reasonable to assume that the half-sister and get daughter will be here, at the house, while I'm recovering from surgery. 
After an hour or so, the half-sister messaged my husband and me announcing the dates of her visit. 
I responded with, ""Any chance you can push back your visit by 2 or 3 weeks?""
Her response?
""And why would I do that?""
My husband replied, ""In part because my wife will be recovering from surgery.""
She pushed back. 
Then my MIL followed my husband into the kitchen and yelled, as if we're the ones being inconsiderate. 
We're both in shock. 
I look forward to learning what everyone else thinks."
amitheasshole,"AITA for telling my baby‚Äôs dad that if his mom continued to disrespect my wishes of no photos of our daughter being posted online, he‚Äôd only be able to see her supervised?",996,2025-04-28 03:24:57,432,"I (22F) have a daughter (5mo). Her father (21M) and I are currently separated due to other non relevant issues. From the moment our daughter was born, I asked/made it clear to family & friends that I absolutely did not want pictures to be posted publicly online. However, it was okay with the exception of holidays and special occasions. We had been together up until our daughter was 3 months old. He had always been onboard with the ‚Äúno pictures posted online‚Äù rule up until we separated. 
His mother (48F) has not been following this rule. I let it slide for the first few months, but then it became obvious a disrespect to my wishes. It was to the point she was posting pictures of her on Facebook 5-6 times a day. For context, when my baby daddy and I separated, he moved back in with his mother. 
Last month, I talked to my baby‚Äôs dad and asked him to please reiterate my rule about the photos. I asked him to do this several times over and over as it kept happening. At one point last week, I had to tell him that I would come pick her up if his mother kept posting photos online. The issue resolved, but apparently only for that night. 
Come this weekend, I‚Äôm on my way to pick up our daughter from her dad‚Äôs house. I had made a pitstop. While I was stopped, I opened Facebook. The first thing I saw was yet again, more pictures posted of the baby 16 minutes prior to me opening Facebook. When I got to his house, I told him we needed to have another conversation. I told him more pictures were posted. He immediately got defensive and said it was two pictures and she only posted once this weekend. I responded with the fact that once a week (which is how often he gets her, Friday to Sunday [not court ordered]) is not every once in a while. He got even more defensive and said it doesn‚Äôt matter what I think when she is in his care. 
This lead to a heated argument where I told him that if it happened one more time, that he could only see her supervised with me present and I would start reporting the pictures. At least, until he got his own place. His excuse is she‚Äôs just excited to be a grandmother and wants to share pictures of her with family/friends. If that‚Äôs what it is, why can‚Äôt she just directly send the pictures to them as opposed to online publicly? 
The reason I have for no photos online is because you never know who or what is looking at the pictures in the most vile ways. No matter how private a page is, there‚Äôs always a way for an outsider to access it. 
I don‚Äôt want to prevent my baby daddy and my daughter from seeing each other, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. He said I‚Äôm being unreasonable about the pictures, but I don‚Äôt think I am. 

So, Reddit, AMITA for telling my baby‚Äôs father that if his mother continues to disrespect my wishes of not posting photos of our child online, that he can only see her if I‚Äôm present until he can get his own place?

Edit: As some of you pointed out by going through my other posts, you‚Äôd see i was in outpatient rehab. Yes. Yes I was. I‚Äôm clean. No I didn‚Äôt use pregnant. I made a mistake during PPD and resolved it. 

And to those saying his mom would be able to get full custody, not with her track record. She had 3 CYS cases open in the last year and a half. She also herself gave up temporary custody of her two underage children while she went to rehab herself two months ago. She just got that custody back. 

Edit 2: I‚Äôm not the only one who used. However, I‚Äôm the only one who went and got help. "
amitheasshole,AITA for stealing my friend's cat,7,2025-04-29 05:33:11,12,"I tried to do the right thing, but I feel like I somehow ended up doing the wrong thing, and I still mull over it and can't tell which is right and which is wrong, so here I am. Basically, my (former, since she hates my guts now) friend had kittens that she let wander around outside on the streets. She was a kind person in every other way and seemed to care about animals, so I didn't want to judge her for it. One day one of the kittens went missing and we couldn't find them. Afterwards, I became more and more concerned for the other kitten that was still being left outside without supervision or even a collar. I guess with my fear of confrontation, since that friend had said before that she had only intended to foster the kitten and give it to someone to adopt, and since my friends who are also passionate about helping cats were also suggesting the same idea, it seemed right at the time to take the kitten indoors and find them a new home myself while pretending like it had gone missing. But the next time I saw the friend, I felt rlly guilty about hiding it from her and told her about it. Idk what I was expecting, but she demanded I return the kitten and said that she had done nothing wrong by leaving it outside and that she wanted nothing to do with me anymore. I was considering not returning the kitten, especially since I was almost certain the kitten wasn't chipped and I didn't want to see them out on the streets again, but I was advised by local rescues that it would probably be in the best interest of my own safety, so I ended up returning it to her through a relative who was there at the time and expressed my concerns about the kitten's wellbeing, and I can only hope I don't see it outside again.

As much as I tell myself to despise the former friend for putting the kitten at risk, I still feel guilty for taking it behind her back. Maybe I could've tried harder to convince her to keep her kitten indoors and none of this would have happened. Or I could have listened to my other friends and not told her at all after taking the kitten. I'm not sure whether or not it was wrong to take the kitten, but at least if I had kept quiet I would have been able to ensure that they got an indoor home where they would be safe. Now I just feel like I failed them both, both my former friend that I betrayed and the kitten I tried to help.

So AITA? Also, is there anything else I can or should do? I mean I feel like that bridge is burned for sure, and I still feel rlly bad about it. (I also hate that I feel bad about it bc part of me feels like I shouldn't care abt her if she was putting her kitten at risk, but then the other part of is thinking of when she was a friend and is having a hard time seeing her as a ""bad"" person.) And I also don't know what to do if I see that kitten wandering around again. I want to help it, but maybe I should just keep away from other ppl's business."
amitheasshole,AITA for standing my ground after my semi estranged father pretended like he was there through sickness and health?,726,2025-04-28 03:44:48,45,"My mother was diagnosed with cancer three years ago and passed away 6 months ago. The grieving process has been tough, but I am trying my best. 

My bio dad (will refer to him as Joe) and my mother met and married when they were very young and poor. Joe was actively involved throughout me and my two sisters childhood (both 5+ years younger). Around the time I turned 14 he wasn't around as much, and I was never given any details about why. But after some information came to light years later, it seems he got insecure about the successfulness my mother had in her work, and left shortly after. 

Joe's relationship to me consisted of yearly unreciprocated ""Happy Birthday"" texts while my sisters would see it as a treat when he came around.

  
When my mother passed, my sisters and I were informed of her rather significant savings that she had kept for us so that we would never land in the same situation as her.

  
Cut to my mothers wake, immediate and extended family, friends, all there in support, including Joe. He was there greeting family members as if he had been there, through thick and thin, of her 3 years of sickness. 

  
This is where AITA comes into play. With him there, acting as if everything was normal, I started to get suspicious that he knew about what my mother had left behind for my siblings and I. Just seeing him interact with my family infuriated me after years of absence. So I tried to confront him, voices were raised, then this interaction follows:

Me: Why are you here acting like you've been here all along?

Joe: I'm just here to take care of my children

Me: I'm an adult, where were you for the past decade when I needed a dad?

After what felt like the longest moment of silence, my youngest sibling ran to Joe's side to give him a hug, and I walked out.

  
I since have had people blowing up my phone, asking if I'm ok, except for my sisters who are the only family I have left. I'm just wondering AITA for potentially ruining my relationship with my sisters and family for standing my ground against my half deadbeat father?"

roommate:

amitheasshole,WIBTAH For Sending My Friend a ChatGPT Analysis of her letter she wrote me?,0,2025-04-30 04:12:15,22,"After setting boundaries in a friendship that had become emotionally overwhelming, my friend sent me a very long, deeply emotional letter. It was several pages long, covered multiple topics (apologies, justifications, health stuff, personal letters to my family, nostalgic memories, even a note ‚Äúfrom her dog‚Äù), and left me completely overwhelmed and honestly confused.

It was hard to even figure out how I felt about it, let alone how to respond. I didn‚Äôt want to ignore it forever, but I also didn‚Äôt want to get pulled back into the dynamic of me doing all the emotional labor to craft the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù response ‚Äî which has happened many times before.

So I did something that helped me get clarity: I asked ChatGPT to analyze the message from a third-party perspective. What I got back was a calm, emotionally grounded breakdown of why the letter felt so heavy and disorienting. It helped me put words to what I was feeling, and it validated why I felt so emotionally flooded.

Now I‚Äôm considering sharing that analysis with her ‚Äî and I would be fully transparent that it came from ChatGPT. Not as a way to insult her, but because I honestly don‚Äôt have it in me to write another multi-draft response from scratch when I‚Äôve already clearly expressed my boundaries. I don‚Äôt want to ghost her, but I also don‚Äôt want to get drawn into another emotionally loaded exchange where I feel obligated to comfort her or explain myself endlessly.

Would I be the asshole if I shared this third-party (AI) perspective instead of writing something fully ‚Äúfrom me‚Äù? Is that cold or unfair ‚Äî or is it okay to use a tool that helped me articulate my feelings when I‚Äôve already done a lot of the emotional heavy lifting?

I'm trying to stay honest and respectful, but also protect my peace"
amitheasshole,AITA for accepting money from a teacher after my parents said no?,2787,2025-04-27 20:09:34,207,"I, (17F), have always had a love for science. This year, I am taking a Marine Biology elective and it has been a blast! The content is very different from the typical science courses offered at my school, but that's what I like about it. Next month, after AP exams, the class will be going on a field trip. When I heard about the trip I was very excited and had my parents sign my waiver right away. The trip is $45. When my parents learned the trip isn't free they told me I could no longer go. I was a bit confused because my parents had never rejected academic field trips, and had paid for more expensive non-academic trips before.

I respected their decision, however when I told my teacher why I could no longer attend she told me about how the school sponsors extra tickets and that there were some unclaimed ones. When I told my parents about this they told me not to accept ""handouts"" because it would be embarrassing for them.  There point felt a bit self-centered, so I submitted my waiver and accepted the free ticket. Last week  my parents got the confirmation email about the trip. For the past \~3 days they have been calling me ungrateful and spoiled for doing this behind their back. They have also been trying to make an example of me to anyone who will listen.

Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, etc. I‚Äôve been taking care of him and the house and kids by myself because of it which is a lot of work with 2 under 5. 


This morning my husband wanted to try eating something so I made him toast as requested. As he was on the couch nibbling on his breakfast I was making our toddlers their breakfast and feeding them when I hear him violently gagging in the other room. He‚Äôd been hanging out in the living room during this entire illness so he had a trash can there in case he had to puke or whatever. I called out to him to remember to use it or to go to the bathroom if he thought he was vomit. He didn‚Äôt listen and threw up all over the floor and got some on the couch. 


Husband then comes into where I‚Äôm feeding our kids and says he‚Äôs gonna go to our room so I can clean up his puke. I said absolutely not there was really no reason for him to vomit all over the floor so he needed to take care of it . I had been cleaning it up all weekend already without complaining when he was getting sick by surprise but he has plenty of time to prepare for this and not make a mess. Husband is now all mad at me for not showing him a good bedside manner.So AITA? 


Update: never expected so many comments. Feel very validated. All day my husband kept making snide comments at me about not being a good wife and anyone who cares about their loved one wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúpunish‚Äù them when they‚Äôre sick. So I showed him your comments and it finally shut him up.


I‚Äôve received many DMs and there‚Äôs been lots of comments about hubby possibly getting me and our children sick, don‚Äôt worry the rest of us are okay. Husband likely got food poisoning from eating food that had been sitting in his work break room for nearly 24 hours.

amitheasshole,AITA for being jealous my dad takes all his vacation days for my stepmother and not me?,166,2025-04-28 11:04:26,85,"So my (20f) dad told me two days ago he would take all his vacation days from work off to spend time with my stepmother and her daughter in late summer. They don't know yet what they are going to do but he took the days off ""just in case"".

Normally I would not have a problem with that since he has an other family besides me. However I was kind of jealous (it's not the right word for what I'm feeling but I don't know how to describe it) he would not have any vacation days left to spend with me.

To clarify a little more: My university holidays are before his ""planned vacation"" with my stepmother and stepdaughter. So even when they don't end up doing something, I would not be able to go on a last-minute-trip with my dad.

I would of course not have a problem with this if it was just a few days or maybe two weeks. But he is taking four weeks off for her.

I am planning a trip to Qatar in November to watch the F1 Grand Prix there and wanted to invite my dad. This would require him to take three days off of work but since he did already take all his vacation days (it would be very complicated to change that now) it's not possible for us. I however did not say anything to my dad and instead just told him, I would go alone.

He then said, he would do it, if my stepmother and stepdaughter can come with us. I immediately declined (for reasons I've listed on an other detailled post on my profile, please check for further information since it's a very long story (it's the most recent post after this one I think)) and just told him I would go alone instead.

My dad then was sad (since he is also a big fan of F1) and told me he was very disappointed I would not try to get along for just a few days with my stepmother and stepdaughter.

I've told my mom about what happened and she is on my side. My grandma, uncle and aunt (all dads side) told me I'm just jealous of my stepmother and that this is ""not that deep"".

So, AITA for being jealous my dad does not take off days from word for me?

Edit: My dad and stepmother are not married and do not live together."
amitheasshole,AITA for getting to know my (f23) grandpa without telling my dad,7,2025-04-29 04:02:43,24,"Some backstory:¬†

My dads bio dad, I'll call him Stan, left my grandma pregnant with my dad. Eventually, Grandma moved on got married and he husband legally adopted and raised my father. Until 16 my dad thought this was his father. Around when Grandma's husband died my dad found out he had a biodad. Dad and Stan had a hard time developing their relationship. when I was born and they reconnected to celebrate Me the first grand-baby. But when my mom and dad split we lost contact with Stan slowly.

I was told a little bit about the situation as a kid, that my dad was adopted but did know his bio dad.¬†

The story:¬†

In my senior year of high school, 2020 my mom told me that she found Stan on Facebook and asked if she could give him my number and maybe we could get to know each other and learn some family/medical history.

It was awkward at first. He was essentially a stranger to me. With all things it took time. So for 3 years we would talk on the phone and get to know each other.¬†

two years ago he moved to my state and we started to plan our first meet. It was awkward but really nice! He wanted to take me out to dinner and show me his neighborhood and tell me more about distant relatives. I brought a photo album with some pictures of me over the years and we looked at those. I even helped him go grocery shopping and sort his pills lol! It was nice.¬†

I‚Äôve only been to see him 5 times, the last 2 years. Sometimes I would come over and spend the weekend or the night, other times we just met up to eat. 

Unfortunately, Stan was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs, and this past Saturday I was informed by his sister that he passed away.¬†

Because Stan sister didn't know my dad very well she didn't think she could comfortably break the news to him. Which means I need to.

I texted my dad today asking him to call me/I have some important information.¬†

I haven‚Äôt heard from him yet but I‚Äôm really worried that in his mind he will see this as a giant betrayal that my mother created to mess with him/poison me against him, that just how he is. 

I‚Äôm nervous my dad will stop talking to me altogether I tell him.

I think it‚Äôs best to do it over the phone so if he starts getting rude I can hang up. I‚Äôve written a bullet point of things to say. 

I know I should‚Äôve said something initially but I was 18, all that Covid shit was going on, I was fighting with my dad and some many other small things. It also took a couple years for it to actually feel somewhat of a grandparent granddaughter relationship and by then it seemed Idk like it had been going on too long to just bring it up out of nowhere, so I never said anything but now everyone‚Äôs gonna know.¬†

Not to mention it‚Äôs a really fucked up scenario that I, the child, have to tell my parent that their biological parent has passed away. Like that would be fucked up for anybody even if they didn‚Äôt have our issues.¬†

But...

...am I the asshole for developing a relationship with my dad‚Äôs biological dad and not saying anything?¬†"
amitheasshole,WIBTA for going on vacation with my friends family without my friend?,8,2025-04-29 03:16:24,11,"am I the asshole for going on vacation with my friend‚Äôs family without her?

over 15 years ago my dear friend Darcy started a running club with her sister.  I wasn‚Äôt an original member of the run club but I was one of the early members. This run club has swelled to having too many members and then we all got into a fight and now we‚Äôre down to a core group of five. and Darcy is not one of those five. 

Darcy is a free spirit and also very reticent. For instance we all thought that Darcy was still living in Connecticut and then we found out that she had moved to Italy months ago. 

So the five court members of the run club are me, Darcy‚Äòs sister who she‚Äôs now kind of estranged from, and some other friends from our circle. This core group has transcended being just a run club, we celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. we supported each other through horrible illnesses, tragedies and divorce, the loss of parents and more. 

Darcy‚Äôs sister, the one that she doesn‚Äôt speak to much, has a vacation home on Tybee Island in South Carolina. As years went by there started to become a annual trip to the vacation home in the summer. Me and my family never went to any of those trips until last summer. Me and my kids went and It was one of the best experiences as a family trip that we‚Äôve ever had. 

recently Darcy sister started planning for this year‚Äòs vacation. there‚Äôs a big group chat with all of the people that are going on the trip and Darcy‚Äòs son announced that Darcy was going to be coming on the trip this year. Everybody was so excited including me about the chance to reconnect with my friend. 

Then I get a message from my dear friend Darcy on facebook. Now Darcy and I have grown apart,  not because we were mad at each other but because Darcy is just a free spirit and moves around a lot.  

So in this message Darcy is saying how weird it is for me to want to go on vacation with her family and be close to her family when she is not around. She said that she heard about it last year and that it was ‚Äústraight up infuriating‚Äù, and that now she hears that I‚Äôm coming again so she just wants to know what‚Äôs up with me and why I wanna be friends with her family and try to be with her family and put our families together. 

Because I am a fawner, I replied to her just saying that I was sorry for not communicating with her and that being with her family in our run club has been something that has really meant a lot to me in the last few years. Its been a support system. And that I didn‚Äôt mean to be weird. 

So that‚Äôs the situation. I haven‚Äôt heard back from Darcy and I haven‚Äôt mentioned this to any of the run club members and especially not Darcy sister because I don‚Äôt want to mess up the possibility of us still all going on vacation and having fun. I really want to go and I don‚Äôt wanna not go."
amitheasshole,AITA for not helping take care of my boyfriend‚Äôs 90 yr old grandma with going to the bathroom?,22,2025-04-28 21:57:31,46,"To preface I‚Äôve been with my bf for 2 years, living with him and grandma for 1 yr. She has dementia and rectal cancer and bad balance. She was relatively stable and she was independent with going to the bathroom until 3-4 months ago when she fell and broke both of her hands. 

She has had 24 hour supervision and care and there has been caretakers that come and help out and his mom and aunt and him all help her out. Out of nowhere about 2 weeks ago I was told by him that I should help out and ‚Äúit would put a few dollars in my pocket‚Äù and almost like I was being volunteered for it and he mentioned this in front of his mom so I felt extremely uncomfortable but I told him that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in case she falls which is the truth to which he started getting argumentative. Then, he mentioned it again a few days ago when his aunt was drafting up the schedule and asked me in front of her ‚Äúyou should do it, even if it‚Äôs once a week‚Äù to which I felt extremely uncomfortable again and his aunt was staring at me and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm concerned because this seems like a foot in the door thing because his mom is going to be away for majority of the summer down the shore, and his aunt is going to be working more and I have summer break from college. They are also concerned about the financial aspect of this because they‚Äôve spent a hefty sum on the care so far, so it‚Äôs just strange to me this is being introduced at this point in time. 

I live rent free here and his family has been nothing short of amazing to me and I really have no where to go. I help out around the house and I‚Äôve cleaned her soiled things before with no problem but this is something where there‚Äôs a boundary, even for money. I also think that in a way I‚Äôm kind of obligated to do this because I am living rent free and everyone else here does it. 

AITA for not agreeing to do this with all the things they‚Äôve done for me and the fact I‚Äôm living rent free? "
amitheasshole,AITA For wanting to spend one-on-one time with my boyfriend for his birthday?,0,2025-04-29 21:39:35,2,"My (16 F) boyfriend‚Äôs (17 almost 18 M) birthday is coming up this weekend. One of our mutual friends is trying to throw a little surprise lunch party for him, which I am totally fine with. She‚Äôs doing a really good job planning it by finding place, time, friends, etc. I don‚Äôt mind that she‚Äôs planning it, that‚Äôs not my issue. I personally am not a big fan of planning events or parties or even attending them. My issue is the fact that my boyfriend and I rarely get one-on-one time together, and I would like to spend time with him during his birthday weekend that‚Äôs just us. She‚Äôs planning the party for Sunday afternoon. This is the main time this weekend he‚Äôs free. So the plan is everyone (8 including me and my boyfriend) has lunch at his favorite restaurant and then goes and plays pickle ball after for a fundraiser . I can‚Äôt play pickle ball because I have a family event that directly coincides with the time. While planning I offered for lunch to be at 12:00 hoping it would end early so my boyfriend and I could spend time one on one, and I could give him his gifts (legos and vintage airplane identification cards), but that idea got shot down because of the fact it would end early. He‚Äôs busy in the morning so I don‚Äôt know if we could hang out before the lunch or not. I feel like the asshole because I want to spend time with my friends and it‚Äôs so amazing to know they care about my boyfriend just as much as I do, but I also want to spend time with him on our own. So would I be the asshole if I texted my friend and asked her to give me some leeway on the time so I can spend time with my boyfriend alone?

To clarify:
1. I don‚Äôt know if people will freak out about the age gap but I am turning 17 in September and we are both in high school and in the same grade
2. I don‚Äôt know if we can hang out on Saturday yet because I have volunteering in the morning and he has a Volleyball game and I don‚Äôt want to intrude on plans with his family if he has them.
3. I don‚Äôt want to invite him to my family gathering because it is my extended family and we haven‚Äôt been dating for very long.
4. We don‚Äôt get a lot of time for just us because we are both busy people. Last week we spent almost all of Saturday and most of Sunday with friends, which was fun but I just want to hang out with my boyfriend."
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I don‚Äôt give my MIL her cat back?,14,2025-04-29 00:11:14,19,"Almost a year ago, my mother in law was trying to regime her cat and dog after finding out my nephew has a pet allergy. This was keeping them from coming to her house, so she decided to rehome shortly before we visited. While visiting, we decided we would love to take in the cat so that she would still be in the family, and when she visits us (we love in MN and she lives in CO) she‚Äôd be able to also see the cat. 
Here is where things get stressful for me. Her dog passed away last week (she was almost 15 and was never rehomed) and today she asked if she could have her cat back. The cat just turned five, so I know it‚Äôs hard to give away your cat when you w had her for four years, but my two year old son is obsessed with the cat, and the cat almost always is attached to my hip. The cat was also obese when she came to us, and the dog who passed away had tumors and was severely thin even when we visited last year, so I worry about not only breaking my and my sons heart by returning her, but also my MIL‚Äôs capacity as a pet owner? Would be an asshole to say no we‚Äôre keeping her? And also how do I even address it when she‚Äôs just lost her dog?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not attending my friends graduation ceremony,1,2025-04-29 13:57:18,29,"I (Accidentally) Booked a Trip During My Friend‚Äôs Graduation and Now She‚Äôs Furious

So a close friend of mine (let‚Äôs call her A) is graduating in a few months, and she‚Äôs really mad at me because I won‚Äôt be able to attend the ceremony.

Here‚Äôs the context: At the end of last year, I had to plan and submit my annual leave for the entire upcoming year (due to the nature of my job). Around that time, A told me her graduation would be in October but she wasn‚Äôt sure of the exact date yet. She asked me not to plan any leave for that month so I could be there.

Initially, I respected that and left October untouched. But later on, my other friends and I were trying to coordinate a trip, and the only week we could all make work was in October. Somewhere along the way, I forgot why I had originally kept that month free and agreed to book leave for that week. We ended up buying plane tickets and locking everything in.

Fast forward to early this year ‚Äî A and I realized that I had accidentally plotted my trip during October after all. She reminded me how important it was to her that I be at her graduation, and I really hoped the ceremony wouldn‚Äôt land during that week.

Well, guess what? She just got the confirmed date and it‚Äôs smack in the middle of the exact week I‚Äôll be away. Now she‚Äôs furious because I can‚Äôt change my plans ‚Äî rescheduling would mean losing over a thousand dollars on non-refundable flights, and even if I wanted to, my leave can‚Äôt be shifted anymore.

I feel like I messed up unintentionally, and I do feel bad. But at the same time, I‚Äôm stuck. So yeah, now I‚Äôm here with a very angry friend and I really doesn‚Äôt know what to do"
amitheasshole,AITA for cancelling DND the day before a group of beginners' first oneshot?,25,2025-04-28 20:04:50,12,"Probably a mistake to post this from my account, but I can't be assed making a burner and I don't think I'm coming off as disrespectful.

So as the title roughly states, I'm the DM and I cancelled the oneshot session which was meant to be an introduction to a friend of mine's four FF14 friends to DnD the day before we were meant to play.

A little book keeping, me and my friends have a Discord server where we host our DnD games. As the local low level enjoyer I also host the oneshot sessions which are ran when people are missing and we want to still play DnD. And it's perfect for when we want to introduce more people to some good ol' TTRPGs. And we play online.

So as ya'll can probably guess a session was cancelled beforehand, about a week and a half beforehand to be exact. So I announced that there'd be a oneshot instead, and my friend asked if he could invite his four FF14 friends to let them try out DnD. I agree and he helps them to make their characters. I add the stipulation that: their characters have to want to join the adventurer guild, that the players have to PM me. The second request is so I can kinda meet them beforehand, get to answer any questions they have and ask my own about 'em.

But the problem for me came from... no one messaging me. I tell my friend this four days before the game's meant to be and he immediately @'s everyone individually about getting in touch with me before the game. One of them does, but the other three don't. So three days before it's meant to be due I make my own announcement as well that I'm glad there's such an interest to try out DnD but that I need to know roughly how many will play so I can prepare the oneshot properly. When there's two days left I make another reminder that I would really like everyone to shoot me a message before the game asap because it'd be very hard otherwise for me to DM. And I do get a second person to message me, but I feel like it was a bit vague if they even would play since they made a duo character with one of the people who hadn't gotten in contact with me. They told me they were actively telling them to get in contact with me. But the person never messaged me.

So when there was one day left until the session (I think slightly less) and I had only been contacted by two out of the four new people and there were question marks on other people as well I made an announcement that I was cancelling the oneshot. Stating that there was too much going on at university for me to prepare a game for either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 players without knowing in advance. 

I could've messaged them first in their PMs when they didn't respond to the first or second direct ping. But I honestly felt just too disrespected and lost motivation to take that step if they'd not even send me a ""Hi"". So AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for speeding away after splashing someone on the sidewalk,6,2025-04-29 03:36:13,22,"This happened yesterday and I'm still unsure what to do. I guess it depends if AITA or not

It was after a huge downpour. I was driving with a couple of friends, and while we were heading down the road, there was a giant puddle right in the middle of the street. I swerved slightly to avoid it and stuck closer to the curb... without realizing there were two guys walking on the sidewalk.

Cue a massive dirty rainwater splash all over them.

At first, I didn't even notice (too focused on the puddle and the road conditions), but my friend immediately pointed it out. I felt horrible ‚Äî it was 100% not intentional, and I honestly wanted to apologize. So I pulled over a little ahead, rolled down my window, and was about to shout a really sincere ""I'm so sorry!""

That's when I noticed one of the guys bend down and pick up a huge rock. 

Needless to say, I decided maybe it wasn't the safest time for an apology. I hit the gas and drove off... but not fast enough, because the guy launched the rock and managed to crack the rear windshield of my car. It's a small crack, but it's definitely noticeable.

Now I'm sitting here feeling guilty about soaking them (again, it wasn't on purpose!) but also kind of shocked that it escalated that quickly. I have a rear dash cam where I can see them somewhat clearly

I'm thinking of repairing it privately as going through insurance may request my dashcam footage, and honestly I feel I'm the one at fault.

 Keep in mind- no other cars around,- there was 2 empty lanes and I intentionally switched to the left (closer to them)

TL;DR: Swerved to avoid a puddle, accidentally soaked two dudes, stopped to apologize, one picked up a rock, I sped off, now have a cracked windshield and likely a repair bill (1k probably- luxury SUV). I have rear dash cam footage of them and may go through insurance/police report

Update: I think a reason why I'm so conflicted is that I probably would've lost my temper and thrown a rock or something too if I was in his shoes

amitheasshole,AITA for having my boyfriend move into my current apartment next year,99,2025-04-28 12:17:10,47,"Hi! I (26F) live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Chicago with 2 friends (26F and 27M). We‚Äôve lived in this apartment since us girls graduated college so will be 4 years. I did the searching for the apartment, I scheduled the tours, all of the utilities are in my name because they didn‚Äôt want to set them up, and all of the furniture is mine (not in a controlling way but they told me when we moved in they didn‚Äôt want to buy furniture). My boyfriend is currently in grad school and is graduating in May. Our plan was always to move in after he finishes grad school and I‚Äôve told my roommates this since the beginning. Last April when we resigned the lease for this year, I even reminded them that this will be my last year with them and then the next year I‚Äôm moving in with my boyfriend. 

This April, we were asked if we wanted to resign the lease. So I asked them if they wanted to live in this current apartment without me and they grumbled how they don‚Äôt want a random roommate but can‚Äôt afford it the two of them. So, I said okay if the two of you don‚Äôt want this current apartment, I love it here and my boyfriend and I will sign the lease. I told them if they want the apartment it‚Äôs theirs but if they don‚Äôt want to live here, I‚Äôll happily stay. They told me okay and that was that.

amitheasshole,AITA if i leave my friend's charity project that depends on my participation,20,2025-04-28 21:09:45,7,"My friend asked me to participate in his charity project. The idea was that he with friends who do handmade jewelry will create small brooches as a symbolic thank you for the donation (for his relative with cancer)

He told me that I would need to make 2-3 brooches, which would take 2-3 hours in total.
In the chat my friend showed his brooch first and it was a full-fledged detailed piece, which usually takes hours to make. He said that he got carried away and that others should not follow his example. But he set the mood, because everyone after him began to make a complex jewelry (few even remade their simple one, being ashamed of the comparison)

I felt awkward showing my simple brooch. I also thought that the person who will receive my brooch will be dissatisfied, comparing it with the others. We all post photos of jewelry in the public group to advertise this charity project.

After that people started donating large amounts and my friend wrote in the chat that he expected us to thank them with even more elaborate jewelry, depending on the size of donation.

Now this is not what I signed up for. I don't have the time or the desire to do this, but everyone else seems fine with it.
I don't want to spend 10+ hours on a piece of jewelry that I maybe could sell. I don't want to look bad again by making a simple brooch.

I decided to leave project and I send a message to everyone, explaining why and that I think my friend could organize this charity better.

My friend said that I'm just greedy and I should be more generous with my time, considering it's for charity. That if I started to participate I can't leave and  let everyone else down. He also said I'm not a good friend and I shouldn't send this message and leave quietly.

We had a baby 5 months ago (who takes up the typical amount of time for a baby of that age). Today my husband and I both woke up sick - I had a severe headache while he had stomach pain with indigestion and vomiting. He tends to be a man who exaggerates his symptoms; we've been together for 12 years and I've noticed this over time. I asked if we should go to the doctor, he said no. I asked if he needed any medicine from the pharmacy, he said no. We slept as a family for a couple of hours, and when my baby woke up, I decided to go to the market and buy ingredients for a chicken soup (that kind of soup for sick people)

When I came back, he looked at me from the bed and said, ""I vomited blood in the sink,"" and I replied, ""You must have your esophagus very irritated. Please vomit in the toilet next time,"" and from there everything escalated. He told me ‚Äúgo f*ck yourself‚Äù, that I had ignored him all day, that he always takes care of me when I'm sick, and blah blah.

I thought about the soup that was cooking in the kitchen, thought about the baby crying in my arms after feeling the tense atmosphere between us, and I wanted to end the relationship, leaving and not coming back. It sounds exaggerated, but it's not the first time we've fought when he gets sick. I guess he expects me to cuddle him and be by his side all the time, which is impossible with my baby, but I feel like he still hasn't realized how demanding it is to care for a baby, and that probably has me exhausted too. I've never been an affectionate woman and he knows it; I feel like he wants to get something from me that doesn't exist. And my headache it‚Äôs still there, because like the mother i am if I get sick nobody cares.

I don't know if I'm the problem or if there's something I'm not seeing. What do you think?

EDIT FOR INFO: He's not vomiting blood, it was an exaggeration from him (I know because I had to clean the bathroom)‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"

Like, I've helped her out at least 15 times in the past 3 months alone. Sometimes with literally 2 hours notice. I've missed study groups, rescheduled meetings, and even called out sick once to help her. I love my niece and nephew but omg it's getting ridiculous.
Yesterday, she texted me at 4pm asking if I could watch the kids from 6-11pm because her regular sitter canceled. I had a HUGE exam the next morning worth 40% of my grade that I needed to study for. I told her I couldn't this time and suggested she try the babysitting app I showed her before.
She freaked out saying it was an important work thing and I was the only person she trusted. I stood my ground for once and said no. She ended up missing her work event.
Now my whole family is blowing up my phone. Apparently this ""work thing"" was actually a dinner with her boss where they were discussing a promotion. My parents are saying I'm selfish and should have just ""studied earlier"" (as if grad school works that way lol).
My sister is giving me the silent treatment and posted a vague FB status about ""people who don't value family."" Like??? I've dropped everything for her kids so many times but the ONE time I prioritize my education, I'm the villain?
I feel bad about the promotion thing, but also feel like I'm becoming her default childcare without any consideration for my life. AITA for refusing to be her emergency babysitter this ONE time?"
amitheasshole,AITA for moving my roommate's dirty dishes outside her door after she left the kitchen unusable?,1906,2025-04-27 18:34:52,113,"so I (25F) share a house with 3 other girls, and we have this unspoken rule that if you cook something, you clean up your mess right after. at least that's what I THOUGHT was the rule. 

last week i came home from a 12hr shift (i work at a hospital) and the kitchen was absolutely WRECKED. like, there were pots everywhere, food stuck to the stove, and dishes piled so high you couldn't even see the sink.

turns out my roommate had meal prepped for the entire week and then just... left it all there. she wasn't even home - went to her bf's place for the night!

i was exhausted, hungry, and tbh just wanted to make a quick sandwich before passing out. but i literally couldn't find a clean spot to even put bread down. i texted the group chat like ""hey who destroyed the kitchen?"" and got no response.

so i took pics of everything, then cleaned just enough space for ME to make MY food. then i took all her dirty dishes, pots, food containers etc and put them in a big plastic bin. i left it outside her bedroom door with a note that said ""next time clean your mess or at least give us a heads up.""

when she got home the next day she FLIPPED OUT, saying i had no right to touch her stuff, that some of it was expensive cookware that could get damaged, and that she was planning to clean it when she got back. she called me petty and controlling.

but here's the thing - this isn't the first time. she's done this before and promised to stop. plus, how am i supposed to use the kitchen when it looks like a bomb went off? the other roommates are split - one thinks i went too far, the other one actually thanked me privately.

AITA for putting all my roommate's dirty dishes in a bin outside her room?"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my BIL he has to get a new tie or he can‚Äôt stand up with us during the ceremony,59,2025-04-28 13:11:15,129,"Backstory: My fiance and I have gotten really into sewing and crafting over the past couple of years - it is the main hobby we do together and it‚Äôs integral to our relationship. Our siblings have also gotten into it recently and so, for our wedding, we thought it would be really fun and highlight the bond between all of us if the groomsmen‚Äîfianc√©s siblings + my BIL‚Äîmade their own ties and the bridesmaids‚Äîmy sister + S.Os‚Äîmade headbands or a hair ribbon! 

We asked everyone if they would be up for the task and they all agreed (except for my sister but I told her she can just buy whatever matches the rest of the group). This is the only bridal party task, since we aren‚Äôt doing bachelor/ette parties or anything like that. We sent the color scheme we wanted to stick to (sage green), a link to our fabric stores that had really cheap fabrics (and offered to pay for the fabric if they wanted), and a template for how to make the designs! This was in the fall and I have been checking up periodically to see how it is going. Everyone indicated that it was going well. 

Why I may be the AH:
This weekend (4 weeks before the wedding), I asked everyone to send me where they are at for a progress check. Everyone sent me these beautiful, eclectic, fun sage green ties and hair ribbons. Except my BIL who made a halfway done, bright orange tie. I was a little confused and clarified with him, like hey, these were the parameters we sent, are you able to meet them by the wedding. He said he didn‚Äôt know but that he was pretty sure he said that he was making an orange tie in the group chat (he did not). So I told him he either makes what we asked of him or buys a matching one, or he can‚Äôt stand up with us during the wedding. He said okay, but then my sister texted me saying he was crying and really upset and felt like he let us down and has been working really hard on it since the fall so we should just let him stand up there with his orange tie. 

AITAH for not letting him stand up there even though he has put a lot of work into his tie? "
amitheasshole,AITA for getting an attitude with my mom for bring up moving out?,49,2025-04-28 14:02:33,42,"I'm 18F like freshly 18. I haven't even graduated yet. My mom have been mentioning moving out since before I was 18. My mom likes to say things like things like ""if you don't follow our rules"" or ""if you don't respect us in our own house"" their rules have always been like ""clean up after yourself"" and ""get good grades."" But lately she seems desperate for me to move out I don't know why but it's driving me crazy. I always say something as ""I'm always working or at school I'm never home anyways"" to which she just rolls her eyes at. I don't know if I should start looking at apartments and if I did move out I wouldn't have the money to live. I work 2 jobs (a grocery store and a daycare). I have been working both since I turned 16 I absolutely love working and making money. I would like to think I'm pretty mature enough to where moms like me not enough to where I can't play with the kids at work and have fun with them. I almost think her reasoning is because I'm a lesbian. I've been dating this girl for a few months. My mom does not approve. I don't expect her to (she's very religious and conservative). I've always been okay with keeping that part of my life mostly separate from her. My girlfriend and my mom have only met once and that was for my birthday. They'll be meeting again for my graduation party. I feel like my mom is one to just cause problems and overreact. She also makes comments about wanting me to stay in her life even after I get married and move out. Her comments of me moving out keep pushing me more and more away. No matter what I do the outcome seems to be I'll be living on my own before the age of 19. What should I do? AITA? 

Edit: I forgot to mention I have been enrolled at a community college for the past 2 years and will be getting my associates with my diploma"
amitheasshole,AITA for going off on my boyfriend's roommate?,28,2025-04-28 16:55:19,21,"i (21f) had some leftover food that my family made for easter that i was not going to eat. so i brought it to my boyfriends house, i figured the leftovers would get eaten since my boyfriend (21m) lives with two of his friends. both (21m)

my boyfriend and one of his friends were in the kitchen when i got to their house. my boyfriend took the leftovers and immediately went to eat some. he asked his friend to try some and he did. the friend went on to repeatedly state that the food was ""so good and delicious"" when everyone could blatantly tell that he did not like the food. which is fine, that's why restaurants have menu's... people have different taste and like different food. his obnoxious remarks did bother me but i just walked away.

the other night my bf went to eat the more of the leftovers. i was on the couch watching a movie. my bf and both of his roommates were in the kitchen, and here goes his friend again with the same remarks about the food. ""white woman's cooking ... so so so good ... delicious food"" he was saying this repeatedly for at least 5 minutes. i think he was trying to make a joke but i'm not sure because no one was laughing. 

so i looked at him and told him, ""look dude, shut up about the food, we get it.. you keep going on and on about how 'good it is' when you obviously don't like it.. you have every right to dislike the food, no one is making you eat it but you don't have to be rude and disrespectful about my family's cooking.""

amitheasshole,AITA for confronting a 16 yo,0,2025-04-29 16:04:11,22,"Hi, i currently got into a badminton ‚Äúsocial‚Äù where a host (my brother) books a few courts for 3 hours every sat and supply‚Äôs the shuttlecocks as well (the thing you have to hit) each player has to chip in 18 dollars for the court hire plus the shuttle cock. as my brother who is older that host the social has love for the sport i can see that he does not make money on these things if anything he loses money (20-40 dollars each time). a player brought a friend that my brother did not know and he did not end up playing the 18 dollars. so my brother had messaged him asking to pay and he said he lost his wallet 

me and my brother are very different where im able to stand up speak and confront people easier as he is more reserved and can be taken advantage of easily, anyways we went for a session today and the boy who is 16 yo and is quite cocky was playing as well, he told me his the 1 that owes me 18 bucks. so i was like you should go ask him and my brother said dw about it he said he lost his wallet and he‚Äôll pay sunday. i am a big person on if someone owes someone money that you do not know you should pay them back or at least owe a close friend some money rather then a random, it is more about the principle to me rather then the money. so i stuck up for my brother even though he said don‚Äôt ask and went to him and said that he owed my brother 18 dollars and that he should pay. I had a stern voice but i did not mean to intimidate the kid one bit only just wanted to let him know that he owed money and it‚Äôs important that he should pay otherwise my brother will lose money. he said to me he‚Äôll pay sunday and i said why sunday why not today as you are playing today you must have money to hire the court anyways my brother ended up approaching and said sundays fine. 

So i want to ask am i wrong for over stepping my brothers boundaries for his own problems that he said he could handle on his own or am i right in a way i would see it as if you owe someone money borrow money off a friend pay the random and owe the friend money? 

At the end of the day i am a 21 yo male that trains and has some muscle and both my legs tatted in a full sleeve though i do not want an image of a ‚Äútough person‚Äù i just love tattoos. i am upset at myself for confronting him but at the same time i hope it will teach him a lesson on paying someone money when it is owed "
amitheasshole,AITA/Am I Ungrateful? My partner is adamant that I am an ungrateful person based on 2 recent situations.,1515,2025-04-27 17:59:15,931,"
1. He went to pick up some food for us. I gave him my exact order and specifically said no drink. He came back with an unsweet tea for me. I said I don‚Äôt want it and that I‚Äôm not sure why he would get me an unsweet tea when I have not once drank an unsweet tea in the 8 years I‚Äôve known him (or ever before that). He said that I am ungrateful and that I should still say thank you because he thought that I would want it. I said I would not say thank you for that because it is more thoughtless because he doesn‚Äôt know that I don‚Äôt drink unsweet tea. I did thank him for going to pick up the food and he thanked me for paying for it.

2. I was filing our daughter‚Äôs nails and he asked me if I was putting her down for a nap after i was done. I said ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôll need to eat lunch first‚Äù and he asked if he should make her lunch and I said yes please. As he was making it we talked across the room about him saving some of the pork for me for my lunch. After he made her lunch, he went ahead and made my plate and started heating up my food. He had not asked me if I was hungry or wanted my food. He assumed. When I found out he had heated my food up, I said I am not hungry yet and felt frustrated that my food was now sitting in the microwave half heated up when I wasn‚Äôt ready to eat. He said I was ungrateful and should have said thank you for his thoughtfulness. I said I would not say thank you for that because he should have asked me if I was ready to eat my lunch before he started heating it up. "
amitheasshole,AITA For telling my mom shes insane for being insensitive towards my boyfriends dead dog?,27,2025-04-28 15:15:07,58,"Im (17F) and im about to graduate. My grades are not straight A's, but they are confirmed efficient to graduate guarenteed. I have 25 days left of school. Recently, my 16(M) boyfriends childhood dog had to be put down due to a cancer in his throat. Obviously, hes been devastated and says he really needs me. Once again, my grades are efficient enough to graduate. Tomorrow, my boyfriend wants me to go to his house to comfort him because he doesnt want to be alone and he wants me there for him. Which I am more than willing to do because I love him so much and I want to be there for him as much as possible. 
As for the story on why I called her insane, this morning she repeatedly told me im not going to graduate and that I have one week left to graduate. Both of these things are factually not true. Neither of those are true at all. I have good enough grades to graduate and 25 days is not a week. She continues to not believe me even though there has been several cases of proof that would tell her I am correct. Shes contacted all of my teachers, my principal, my counselor, and more, and all of them say I am graduating guarenteed. 
She then told me that I am stupid for prioritizing an ""already dead dog"" over my grades. and his dog or his feelings do not matter right now. I told her ""youre insane, i am graduating, my grades don't have feelings, my boyfriend does"" and now shes super angry at me. AITA?

I think like an year ago, as a prank I made like 5 profiles and made sure that the names of the profiles all had dirty innuendos or names as a joke (as an example of what I would say the least inappropriate one was, it was called ""c\_\_\_sucker"".

Yesterday, my sister called me and she was sort of upset with me, but not too upset. Apparently, at the company where she works at, she was going to watch a Netflix movie on her laptop at lunch with some other coworkers, including her boss. She said she played it off and told the truth that she barely uses the account and that I was the one who changed the names, and apparently her boss and other coworkers found it funny. 

I still feel kind of bad even though all's well that ends well, and I probably should have told her at some point within the time between when I made the profiles and yesterday about what I did. AITA?"

Yet our mutual ex seemed shocked when he arrived and saw her here, and at some point he pulled me aside to ask what was I thinking, and why I would invite her without checking with him first if it was ok.

amitheasshole,AITA for not giving my GF another bike‚Ä¶ again?,67,2025-04-28 09:25:44,33,"AITA for not wanting to give my GF another bike?

Hi everyone, first time poster here. 

Me (30M) and my girlfriend (27F) have been living together for the past year and a half in Barcelona. 
We moved here because she got a job offer here, so I quit my job back home and moved overseas with her.

I bought 2 bikes for us to move around the city, one vintage one for her and a folding bike for me. Since I didn‚Äôt need mine everyday for work, she started using it to go to work, since it was easier to move around with. 
Up until here I‚Äôm totally fine with this, since I wasn‚Äôt using mine daily and it was more comfortable for her. 

One important thing to mention is that we bought locks for the bike, the ones that look like an odd shaped D (we call them D-Longs) and a metal cable. I specifically taught her how to lock the bike, since barcelona is famous for having lots of stolen bikes, especially if you leave them unattended.
So basically the Dlong is to secure the frame to a post, and the cable is to hold the front tire, so that you don‚Äôt end up with a monocycle. 

Long and behold, a total of 3 days later, her bike got stolen. When she left the office, the only thing attached to the post was the Dlong and one end of the steel cable to the Dlong. 

This was a big hint that she didn‚Äôt lock the bike the way it was supposed to, like I taught her. The cable is really easy to pry open with a metal bar. 

After a few fights and sobbing about the bike, I bought 2 more of those folding bikes that are really handy, one for her and one for me, again. 

All of this happened more than a year ago. She was really happy with the new bike, I added a rack and a basket for easier transportation of her bag, and in the meantime i saw a business opportunity of flipping bikes, since i scoured the internet for some time until I found the bikes I wanted and got to ‚Äúknow‚Äù the sector.

Both of our new bikes have been sleeping outside of our apartment, locked to a metal rail just in case. 
The thing is, my gf has been coming late and tired from work, and wasn‚Äôt eager to lock hers to the rail. 
I actually got tired of asking her to lock it, since anybody could just snatch it and take it home or even outside and steal it easily. 
(One really important piece of information is that we have squatters in our building, and unknown people enter the building every day)

I was actually impressed that the unlocked bike wasn‚Äôt stolen right away. But not to my surprise, this saturday when we left our apartment, the bike was gone. 

My gf cried, I actually didn‚Äôt care that much for her feelings, since I endlessly asked her to lock it to no avail. 

Now she is asking me to give her one of the bikes I have in stock to flip, but I really don‚Äôt want to, since both times the bike got stolen it was her negligence that got the bikes stolen. 

She thinks I‚Äôm being rude and unhelpful, but in my opinion she doesn‚Äôt deserve for me to fix her problems‚Ä¶ again.

Keep in mind, I paid for both bikes that were stolen. 

So, AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not voting this last election?,0,2025-04-30 01:10:21,2,"Hi there! Anonymous account for obvious reasons, but I am 20 y/o and live in a complete Trump town down south. As a kid my parents weren‚Äôt involved in politics pretty much at all, in 2020 that entire wave of conservative conspiracies wiped my mother completely off her feet. So much that as a 16 y/o, already dealing with massive depression, was being fed the impending doom complex and if I‚Äôd try to have my mom back off she‚Äôd just make fun of me for trying to take a middle stance. My sister after she moved out took a complete liberal stance so far to cut my parents off for a couple years and would fight them on every little thing. The conspiracies include: flat earth, lizard people, vaccines causing autism, rigged elections, space being a myth, and so many more. The thing is, I‚Äôm the baby of the family and always loved my mom so much I‚Äôd do anything for her, but when the election was going on I was instructed to go to the poll and put her ‚Äúsavior‚Äù on my ballot. Now i still do consider myself to be very middle ground (against the extremism) but was ready to vote for Mr. Donald Duck. But I had just finished the first season of Handmaids tale and was absolutely losing my shit, so I sat at the poll office and cried for about 30 min before just leaving without voting. A while before the election I had played it out to seem I‚Äôm on my moms side as well as I tried to convince myself of these things, but for some reason I still feel extremely guilty. I‚Äôm still stuck with the impending doom complex but now from both sides of politics, and my mom still sometimes thanks me for being on her side and voting her way. So am I the asshole for lying to my parents and not voting at all?"

amitheasshole,AITA for asking my (32F) husband (36M) to stop playing music professionally for three months?,620,2025-04-27 20:35:23,221,"Background: my DH has been playing music for many years and is an excellent musician. He has played with some high profile artists, either as an opener or in the band itself. We have been married for over 6 years now, have a 4 year old, and another baby on the way.

Currently, I am less than 20 days out from having a baby, and months ago I asked my husband to block off his calendar for May through July to make sure that he was here and I had support right after childbirth. My last pregnancy recovery was rough and I ended up trying to ‚Äúbounce back‚Äù far too quickly. So, this time, I wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt left alone for extended periods and had the help I needed. 

A few weeks ago I received several notifications to our shared family calendar. When I checked the notifications, I saw that he had blocked off three weekends in May, an entire week long trip in June, and 16 days in July to play shows. When I confronted him about this, he said that he thought we needed the money. I reexplained my fears about being left with a child less than a month old as well as our 4 year old while still trying to recover myself, and he brushed it off.

Part of me wonders if he said yes to the dates because he knows I won‚Äôt push him to go back on his word, because that could cost him opportunities to make additional income in the future. Another part of me is trying to get him to understand that the $200-300 he‚Äôs making per show may not be worth it if he‚Äôs gone for 18 hours at a time and having to spend money for gas and food and the occasional hotel. Not to mention that if there was an emergency while he was gone, he‚Äôd be 13 hours away for some of the shows. I know he enjoys going to play, and we do make SOME money from it, but I just wonder if it‚Äôs worth it?

I had gone over to dinner with my in-laws last week when he was gone on a show, and my MIL was livid. She and my FIL were in bands when they were younger, and they both apparently stopped once they started having kids. When she found out that he‚Äôd be gone when the baby is less than a week old, she told me that if she were in my shoes, she‚Äôd give him an ultimatum: the band or the family.

MIL apparently talked to my husband today and read him the riot act. He came home and told me she talked with him about it and said ‚Äúthanks for that‚Äù. I explained that she had just asked where he was for the dinner, and then asked more questions about gigs and when he was planning on stopping. He told me it was to help provide, and I told him that he is worth more to me than $100. He told me I was being selfish and not thinking about the long term. I told him that I felt like he just wanted to ignore our children and be a silent investor.

So, AITA for wanting my husband to stop playing music for two months while I recover from birth? I‚Äôd really love to hear from any musicians that play professionally, if possible, because maybe I‚Äôm missing something here"
amitheasshole,AITA for not cooking for my boyfriend‚Äôs family the first time meeting them?,126,2025-04-28 04:47:32,88,My bf and I just went to visit his family (I'm meeting them for the first time) in Chicago and he suggested cooking for his family. I politely declined and he actually expressed disappointment that I didn't wanna cook for his family. AITA for not wanting to cook for them and rather get to know them first. Plus I feel like it's vacation so I should get a break since I'm always cooking for us (he doesn't know how to cook). I just wanna be treated like a guest and not a host. 
amitheasshole,AITA for not choosing a side between my sister (29F) and mom (63F),13,2025-04-28 17:29:08,20,"My mom and sister have never gotten along. I (25F) have always had a better relationship with my mom then my sister did and vice versa. Our dad died 4 years ago due to cancer and my sister chose to be his primary care giver since it was hard to find in-home nurses during the peak of Covid. Mom and dad were married for 40 years at this time and mom was extremely distraught so she helped out but sister is a nurse so she knew the ins-and-outs better.

Mom and sister continuously fight about this along with other things. Mom will ask sister a question and instead of answering yes or no she will say ""I already told you."" This irritates my mom and I but I try to stay out of it. These fights aren't quick either they turn into huge blowouts that take a few days to pass over.

Mom is also a problem as she gets irritated and has severe depression that she will not get help for so tends to make the entire house difficult to live in. She lashes out as us for her own problems.

Example... Mom and I went to the bike store to look at electric bikes on Saturday, she bought two for the both of us to ride this summer. In exchange for that she wanted to see my bank account. She has been wanting to see this for months and I told her it was none of her business but eventually relented because I wanted the bike. Later that night my best friend from college and I were texting about me driving 1,000 miles to visit her for 2 weeks this summer and when I brought it up to mom she blew up and said I couldn't afford to do that. Turned into a huge fight. Fast forward she wakes up the next day and is stomping around the house and making a big problem out of nothing. When shes upset she makes the whole house difficult to live in but I can not move out as I am applying for grad school and cannot afford to live on my own. Sister also lives at home until she moves out with her boyfriend in August.

So the next morning mom is in a mood and sister and I say she can't make the house this toxic anymore. Low and behold another fight starts. Mom and sister start blowing up again and mom calls the cops as she is ""sick of her attitude and behavior."" Cops come and split us all up and take our statements and leaves. Sister goes to stay with her boyfriend for the night. I avoid mom by staying upstairs for the day.

I try to stay on moms good side but I do argue with her because she is emotionally unwell and I don't have many friends so I spend a lot of time with her. I need to live in her house for the next few years and don't know what to do because I'm scared my sister will cut me off too for having a relationship with mom when she moves out in August. I would move out but I can't afford to live elsewhere at the moment and mom doesnt charge me rent but constantly complains about not having enough money.

AITA for not choosing a side? If yes, what advice do you have for me?"

amitheasshole,AITA : Me and my neighbor are not on good terms !,3,2025-04-28 23:21:43,11,"Me (F22) Neighbor (F51) To start the story two weeks ago we were hanging out when she mentioned me possibly giving her a ride the following weekend to pick up her car ,she hadn‚Äôt purchased it yet or from what I was aware of that weekend . She did not mention a time or day specifically I told her I was free Friday or Sunday ! 
The Work week goes by I work doubles on Thursday and Wednesday so I‚Äôm not home all day but , Wednesday night I notice a new car at her house I don‚Äôt think anything of it could be a friend or anyone . . She called and texts to hangout Wednesday Thursday I expressed I was busy and work all day. Finally Friday comes I sleep in because it‚Äôs my day off , I see she called me when I woke up and honestly I had forgotten after a long week of work and we had been drinking that weekend . So I just continued to do my daily duties wash dishes blah blah blah well 4 pm comes around I get a text very sarcastic that goes.
 ‚ÄúOh wee, so glad I can count on you to take me to pick up my car! Appreciate you! ‚Äú  I apologize and express I had forgotten and that it had been a busy week for me ! I tell her I can give her a ride and ask if she‚Äôs already made it up there. She continues to say ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù And obviously she was mad ! But carrying on I tell her again about what had happened etc etc and she said ‚Äúno worries .not mad at all ‚Äú so I let it go as there‚Äôs nothing I can do ! 
I learn that the car I seen Wednesday was the new car so I send her a text to let her know how I think it was wrong of her to to act as if I‚Äôm not a supportive friend and being passive aggressive all because I didn‚Äôt give her a ride on Friday when she already had the car Wednesday ! I felt she could‚Äôve simply told me she had the car Wednesday instead of treating me like I‚Äôm stupid  or didn‚Äôt care enough to take her ! And it just led to a little back and forth .

They told her she should go out, but she didn‚Äôt **listen**. She told them she **would also like to do her kitche**n, and therefore she wanted to know what the company‚Äôs name is. The worker told her it isn‚Äôt right that she enters the apartment when the owner is not there. **She couldn‚Äôt understand what the problem was.** The worker told me this story when I came back.

amitheasshole,AITA for asking my flatmate to be more considerate?,4,2025-04-28 20:02:35,18,"
I (25F) live in an older house with three other flatmates ‚Äî all women around the same age, mid-twenties.

I work late shifts in healthcare, meaning I don‚Äôt usually get home until close to midnight. By the time I‚Äôve showered and had a cup of tea to wind down, it‚Äôs usually between 1‚Äì2 AM before I finally crawl into bed. Sleep is precious to me ‚Äî I need it to function safely and properly at work.
One of my flatmates, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúLily,‚Äù has her bedroom right next to mine. She is, without exaggeration, the loudest person I have ever lived with. She‚Äôs also a bit on the heavier side ‚Äî which matters here because the way she moves around the room quite literally causes my bed to shake. 

Every morning at 6 AM, like clockwork, she wakes up, cranks her TV up so loudly I can hear full conversations through the walls (sounds like she is currently watching this is us) and stomps back and forth across her room while on the phone (or, if not on a call, singing loudly to herself).

Shes getting ready for work ‚Äî that‚Äôs fine. But when I‚Äôm getting four hours of broken sleep a night because my walls are shaking and a TV is blaring next to my head, it‚Äôs hard not to lose my mind a little bit...

It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs quick about it, either. She takes about two hours to get ready each morning. Two hours of stomping, shouting, and blaring TV before she even leaves the house.

I finally approached her about it ‚Äî very calmly, just asking if she could maybe turn the TV down in the mornings and try to be a little quieter with the stomping. I explained that I work late and desperately need sleep, especially since I work in healthcare where medication calculations and patient safety are on the line.
Her response? She told me to wear earplugs.

I tried to explain that I have a medical issue ‚Äî a Eustachian tube defect ‚Äî that causes frequent ear infections, and that wearing earplugs isn't a safe or sustainable option for me. In fact, I have one currently as I am writing this. She completely dismissed me, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that deep‚Äù and basically accused me of making a big deal out of nothing.

When I tried again, trying to frame it as a shared living issue ‚Äî not a personal attack ‚Äî she turned it around, accusing me of picking on her because of her weight. I was genuinely stunned. I don't care about her size. I care about the fact that my bed is literally shaking while I‚Äôm trying to sleep, and that I‚Äôm being forced into chronic sleep deprivation for six more months because of a tenancy contract I can't get out of.

I‚Äôve resorted to playing rain and thunder sounds on my TV just to try and drown her out, but it only helps so much.

I‚Äôm running on fumes, and honestly, it‚Äôs scary. Sleep deprivation isn't just making me grumpy ‚Äî it‚Äôs dangerous in my line of work. Mistakes could seriously hurt someone.

I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck, and no matter how respectfully I bring it up, she refuses to acknowledge it‚Äôs a problem. I‚Äôm not asking for silence. I‚Äôm just asking for some basic consideration."
amitheasshole,AITAH for telling my mom she shouldn‚Äôt come?,7,2025-04-28 19:57:33,10,"1. My mom, (50 F) is a very anxious person because of childhood trauma, this makes her very anxious in crowded/ loud environments, which irritates her and makes her very angry 
2. I (F) enjoy going to Conventions for Anime, comics, etc. and have been going since 2021, only in January did my mom come with me, it‚Äôs always been my Step dad(SD 49 M) or my sister. 

onto the story. my mom owns her own business and has been wanting to come to a con with me and SD to see if she can get any ideas, back in January she went to a VERY popular con, I mean we had to come back the next day because they couldn‚Äôt let any more people in that day type popular. I was in a line trying to get something signed and asked SD to join me since my mom had found someone and was talking and the line I wanted into was growing quickly. My mom was still in sight of me and SD, me and a lady Were chitchatting when mom came up behind me and SD. No one knew she was there and she didn‚Äôt let any of us know either, she got mad and stormed off and we had to leave early, then, in March there was another con, to which I told mom I didn‚Äôt think she should come because of what happened last time, she ended up canceling on me and SD because ‚ÄúSD doesn‚Äôt want me to go because then he has to act married.‚Äù (My mom and SD have had problems of both thinking the other is cheating, etc) All she did when we got home was complain and make snippy comments while me and SD recalled funny moments to her. 

Now, the point at hand. Sorry for all of the other stuff but it is important!! There is a con in July, I am working on entering the cosplay competition there, mom keeps saying ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so anxious to try and do this again‚Äù even after saying she‚Äôs a changed person, so one night when it was just me and her I snapped, saying something like: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you not go with us, though it‚Äôd be really nice to have BOTH my parents at my comp, not because I don‚Äôt want you there, but because you can‚Äôt just walk away when you get anxious, you get mad and make the time miserable till it forces everyone to leave for you. But if you do go I will NOT be stopping anything for you and I WILL tell you to find somewhere else to be for a few minutes.‚Äù She then said that if it was that big of a deal she‚Äôll go home and we (me and SD) can just Uber home, to which I just went to bed and was later told by SD she went to bed crying. honestly I don‚Äôt feel bad. She always does this, no matter where we go, grocery stores, her events for her business, etc. she gets mad and blames everyone else. I never said she couldn‚Äôt come with us, I just said I‚Äôd rather her not because of her actions. So AITAH?  "
amitheasshole,AITA for not sitting with my friend in class?,11,2025-04-28 15:54:27,7,"So me (17m) and my friend (17f) sit together in pretty much every class we have with each other. We got to choose a new seating plan last week and everything's fine except for biology class.   
I told her from the beginning that I won't be sitting in the back so I can hear the teacher better. There were only 2 seats left that weren't in the back row so I wanted to sit down, but one of the guys already sitting there told me he 'won't be sitting next to a f-slur' (directed at me). I didn't care tho because it's just one class, so whatever, it's his problem. I would even sit next to him so my friend doesn't have to. My friend said that she doesn't want to argue and just sat down in the back. 

So now there is empty seat next to me where she could sit but she said I am the asshole for leaving her alone in the back row (there is no one else), because she said she doesn't like confrontation. I feel kinda bad for her sitting all alone in the back, but I literally cannot hear the teacher from back there. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA I snapped at my brother for making comments on what I eat.,5,2025-04-28 19:31:23,11,"AITA?

So I'm (f going on 19). My brother is a couple years older than me. I'm not that big, I did have weight issues when I was younger but I learned to control them and have lost alot of weight now. Almost 60 lbs. I still want to lose 20 more lbs but I've been at a plateu.

I still have a sweet tooth I will admit, I'm terrible with sweets. But I always workout after and it's not like I have sweets everyday. Just like maybe once or twice every month. 

Anyway this morning (we had leftover cake from a party) and so for breakfast and lunch I had cake now I know that's not the healthiest choice and I'm very extremely aware. Anyway he was being extremely rude and telling me how I eat too much and how I'm going to lose my fingers and toes from diabetes (which i do not have). And just being a complete dick.

The thing is I barley eat much actual food I've slowed down 10 times than what I was years ago. But god forbid a girl that wants some cake for breakfast. Anyway I snapped and told him I eat what I want to and he's not in control and that I'm fully aware of my choices and told him to fuck off.

Now he haven't talked since then. Am I the asshole???"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to be at my sister's birth?,366,2025-04-27 20:09:15,79,"So I (19F) and my sister (19F) are twin sisters, we have been close for a very long time and spent our whole lives together. Back in October she informed me that her and her boyfriend were having a baby together, I was incredibly happy for her and both our parents have been really supportive. She's been feeling pretty crappy during the pregnancy but it was nothing out of the ordinary. 

It's now I would like to mention that she and I both have autism. She struggles more socially while I struggle more with sensory issues like hating loud noises, textures and bright lights. We always connected because of that and we felt like the other understood us when nobody else did, which is why I was shocked when we started arguing.

See, she told me that she wanted me to be in the delivery room with her while she was giving birth, I was honored of course but told her that I don't think I would be able to. Hospitals are really loud places, and I know there would be a lot of screaming during the delivery, I know that if I were to be there, I would end up having a meltdown and making the birth experience a lot more stressful than it needed to be. 

I told her this, but said that I would happily wait to see her after the baby's born. She said that it was fine but I knew she wasn't, I kept prodding and asking her to tell me how she really feels and she told me that she was really hurt that I wouldn't be in the room with her, and that I was being selfish by not being there. 

This actually made me really upset as I thought she would be more understanding because of the connection I mentioned earlier. I told her that just because she can handle the environment despite her autism doesn't mean I would be able to as well, and that this moment would probably be better if it was just her and her boyfriend anyway. 

She then tried to butter me up I assume, by saying that my presence there would be so helpful, and that I should just try and bring noise-cancelling headphones with me. I know that won't be enough as it's not just the noise, but the environment, the general vibe and unpredictability. 

Our parents are asking me to be a bit more understanding of my sister, that she's going to be a first time mum and I'm her biggest support, but I know that if I go I would ruin both her and her boyfriend's first experience of childbirth. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not giving my friend one of my days at work.,30,2025-04-28 09:37:23,26,"So to start this off we go back 2 weeks to a question i was asked by one of my best friends, he asked me what my finances are. When i answered him, he waits until we are face to face to ask me if id be ok giving up my saturday so he could have an extra day, I tell him I cant without going behind on my bills but maybe around july when my bills are straight i should be able to

Now about 2 months ago he asked if id take his shift so he could spend more time with his gf. My shift at The time was 4 days a week and his was 5 days. I agreed because i needed the money for my bills as im barely scraping by.
He is now asking for the saturday back due to they found out last week they are expecting and the guy who they are renting with rn is supposedly ""throwing them out"" come july

 I explained to him that I couldnt and that me and my gf wont have a place to stay at the end of June due to her getting kicked out of her sisters home and my family not allowing her and her cat to live with me

He then calculated mine and my gf's finances from 2 weeks ago when he asked me about them and told me i could afford to give him the day.

I got severly offended by this and told him no i cant give him the day and told him if he needs money that bad to stop buying frivilous things that im aware they do spend on or to get a second job like he has had in the past or that it doesnt help too much that his gf is part time and only works 4 days a week that are 5 hours long.

I explained that i dont even have the money right now to buy normal groceries from my bills i owe on, which are from financial decisions before i lost my last job or unexpected expense. Not me being wreckless.

He then tells me he offered only to take the Saturday and that if he wants he could use his seniority to make use swap shifts entirely (he knows i prefer nights cause my gf works nights)
He also brings up how he got me my last job and the one we are currently working at and that im being ungrateful to him.

I explain to him that at the past job and this one ive done nothing but cover days for him despite me never taking one off myself and that at this one he asked me to cover a day before i started along with working a double into a quick turnaround when i didnt even have training yet.

I found out through the guy he rents from that he already asked our boss for the day before asking if i was ok with it and that he isnt getting kicked out in july and that its a slight possibility but probably not. Which means this is their choice not out of nessecity. And they arent going for something cheap


And i want to clarify how I always bend over backwards for him and his gf doing this like working on their thing lr other things
And i wish i was painting him in a bad light but i seriously cant think of a time where he seriously helped me out.

I explained that seniority at the job or not on a friend level it makes me feel like an asset.

So AITA for saying no to my friend and being upset with him over this?

amitheasshole,AITA for prioritizing my boyfriend for a couple hours on my sister‚Äôs birthday?,2,2025-04-28 23:46:43,19,"Hi Reddit,

I (mid-20s F) had a situation today and I‚Äôm wondering if I was out of line.

Today, I biked to and from work for the first time in months because the weather finally warmed up after a long winter. I was feeling really happy and energized. On my bike ride home, my boyfriend (also mid-20s) called me through my AirPods and asked if I wanted to go to the movies. I was excited because I had previously told him that I appreciate when he initiates plans, and he‚Äôs been working on it.

Now, I did know it was my sister‚Äôs birthday today ‚Äî but we had already had a full birthday celebration for her yesterday: a family dinner and cake at my grandmother‚Äôs house (extended family even flew in from another country for it). My boyfriend didn‚Äôt come to the dinner but did show up at my grandma‚Äôs for cake afterward.

For context, my sister, my parents, and I all live together in the same house.

When I got home, I was planting flowers outside when I remembered we were supposed to have a small dinner for my sister that evening. I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure how ‚Äúbig‚Äù tonight‚Äôs dinner was supposed to be ‚Äî my sister had specifically said no to me making brownies (her favorite), saying we already had cake yesterday, so I figured it was going to be a more casual dinner.

My boyfriend had already driven 30 minutes to see me, and I was starving (dinner wasn‚Äôt for another 3 hours). So, we decided to get a quick snack together. I made sure we were back before dinner started.

When I got home, it was clear something was off. My sister was upset and at one point screamed, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just have one day!‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming she was upset that I spent time with my boyfriend on her birthday before the dinner, even though I was on time.

My parents wouldn‚Äôt tell me exactly what happened, but based on the vibes, I feel like I might have been the cause.

So, Reddit, AITA for hanging out with my boyfriend before my sister‚Äôs birthday dinner even though I made it back in time?

amitheasshole,AITA for not going to my best friends wedding?,137,2025-04-28 00:54:20,37,"So I (25F) & my husband (27M) got married 5 years ago & have been trying to get pregnant for the last 3 years. That‚Äôs around the time I met my best friend, Allie (27F). Her boyfriend(30M) & my husband were also best friends & we did everything together. Her boyfriend proposed & she asked me to be a bridesmaid & the boyfriend asked my husband to be the best man. There was one day we were at a bar, talking about my fertility appointments that I had, she said ‚ÄúIf you get pregnant, I want you to know you won‚Äôt be in my wedding‚Äù laughing. This past summer we went on a trip & we were doing everything they wanted to do so by about day 4 I told my husband ‚ÄúI paid over $3000 for this cruise, so im not just going to sit at the same bar every night‚Äù which he agreed to. Everything was still fine. But I found out I was pregnant two weeks later & I told her bc I was excited. Then three weeks later I miscarried & I called her sobbing & she started talking about her upcoming wedding & she asked if I had bought my bridesmaid dress yet. I was confused but told her yes. A couple months later, I‚Äôm still getting fertility treatments & I found out I was pregnant again. My husband & I were super excited and wanted to share it with our best friends. Then at 16 weeks I miscarried. But when I called her this time, she brushed it off & told me to sell my baby stuff for a profit. Then a couple of days later I get a phone call asking if I know anything about the bridal shower (Side note: it was hard keeping up with both group chats while I was working and going to school. I barely replied but knew what was happening). I told her that the only thing mentioned in the text was a theme &what to wear. She told me that both events had been planned by two bridesmaids in the group chat that she was not in &that I was still more than welcome to come to the wedding but ‚Äúwith everything I was going through‚Äù she didn‚Äôt think I should be a part of the wedding. Fast forward a couple weeks my husband receives a text that stated he no longer needs to be the best man &that they still wanted us to be there. I think this started when we both said we wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend the bachelor/bachelorette trips because I was pregnant & needed to save money & the trip was going to be $3500+. Then one day I got off of work &went to see my husband at an event when I was approached by a mutual friend, Sarah (30F) &she began to berate me for not going to the bridal shower &stated that I was a bad friend & I should‚Äôve sucked it up & gotten over myself to be there for her. I asked Sarah what she was talking about &was told that she was told at the party. I tried to defend myself &tell her my ‚Äúside‚Äù Sarah told me there are no sides & that I should‚Äôve put my feelings to the side to be there for our ‚Äúmutual friend‚Äù. This put a bad taste in my mouth & I felt uncomfortable. In the end, we ended up not going to the wedding because 1. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable 2. We were both removed from the wedding parties "

amitheasshole,WIBTA If I charged my friend interest on a loan,9,2025-04-28 15:30:15,20,"Handful of us including me and a very long time friend of mine (think 20ish years) are throwing a party for another long time friend of ours (think 15ish years).  I offer to foot a lot of the upfront cost and tell them to Venmo me back later. Because I'm down to grind out some airline miles on the card, and with the exception of very long time friend, I've never had any trouble getting money owed from anyone in the past. 

We're now a month and a half past when I put the initial charge on my Visa. His share is $300+ and everyone else who owes has paid.  Very long term friend is known to be VERY tight fisted with money despite being the most well off of the friend group so this isn't really out of character for him. But this time something in particular is kinda rubbing me the wrong way. He made a comment about how ""I'm doing usury because I used all of us to get points on my credit card"". Which like yeah, on the one hand I admit I jumped at the opportunity to get the miles. But on the other hand, my immediate response was you ""you also have a credit card and a Venmo, you could have volunteered but you didn't"".  Plus I'm Jewish so the usury dig cuts a *bit* deeper than it would for most even though we're long time friends where we toss personal remarks around. 

I'm not trying to blow up my longest friendship over interest on a couple hundred bucks. Especially when I do well enough that I *can* afford to float the payment until he chooses to bless me with it so I can grow interest in my savings account instead of him in his. 

Ninja edit: I should add as additional info that I and one of the other friends found out over lunch that he has hundreds in cash sitting in his Venmo this moment from selling digital items in a video game. Forgot about that for a second."
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to speak to my mom like before,7,2025-04-28 16:58:58,12,"
AITA cuz i had a fight with my parents and my dad apologized but mom didnt. I dont want to talk to my mom like how I used to. I usually am so lively,cheerful, kind and smiley but rn, im not. My attitude is like this emoji: üòë . Usually i always ask how my mom is after i come home from school (i call her cuz she gets home late from work) and if shes doing well, i tell her sm of my day and she does too (this is when she comes off from work or when shes ohw (literally we dont stop yapping; we could talk for hours).

I 14F have divorced parents who literally dont get along. Ive always been the barrier (i think thats what its called) between them. They dont talk at all so its always like this: tell your dad /mom to‚Ä¶
I had a huge fight with my dad  (who lives abroad) because of money (mom basically started jt) and my mom found out about it through my aunt. 
I left home at Wed night (i didnt run away i js said ‚Äúi want to go to my grandmas cuz you are making too much noise and im tryna sleep i got school tmrw‚Äù - i have a room there - cuz she had her friends over) 
ive been at my grandmas house ever since. Anyway yesterday night my moms best friend who‚Äôs basically her sis whom im super close w, called me and gave me a whole lecture on how i should never treat my mom like this cuz she gave birth to me and now her body hurts so much because of me and how i made her so tired when i was a baby etc. She doesn‚Äôt know that Ik that she put me on speaker and i just know my mom was on the other end too. Idk how to explain but ik. I kinda let ‚Äúhell loose‚Äù i  complained about how annoying and unfair it was and moree

She told me i should go back home and act like nothing ever happened 

Then today my aunt (same aunt who i called crying after the fight aka my moms sis) called and said what im doing is really inappropriate and that a person should be sad for a day and wake up be fine, not sad and shutting off for a week. She said my mom is shit but im even shittier (not being fr) If im being totally honest, i am still hurt with my parents but im over it but i dont want to say that cuz i dont want this to happen again and they do nothing about it. I dont want them to see me as ‚Äústrong, forgets & forgives easily‚Äù

My mom did not bring up the situation once and shes been so dry and cold (i dont blame her honestly cuz im doing the same) with me ever since i left. Plus idk if this counts but i called her a few days ago after the driver came to pick me up and told her ‚Äúmom i dont wanna go back home‚Äù she asked why and i said ‚Äújust because‚Äù she said ‚Äúwhatever, your choice‚Äù
I forgot to mention, my dad called me yesterday and apologized and promised he would never repeat it and when i told my aunt why doesnt she do the same, she said why would she? She doesnt need to Shes my mother, not me. And who am i to ‚Äúraise‚Äù my mom.

amitheasshole,AITA for not going to my brother‚Äôs wedding?,6,2025-04-28 19:10:04,23,"I 35F did not want to go to my brothers wedding 36M. A little back story. This has been going on for years. She secretly get mad at me over some bs and then eventually gets over it and we're cool again. This is a real life roller coaster. My brother was dating this women 36F for about 1 year and they split up. She went off and got married, that lasted 5-6 years. Once that ended my brother stepped into the picture again. Fast forward they had a baby and moved in quickly.. Within the 1st year of getting back together. She's never really liked me because we were really friends before. Now she has made it so hard for me to do anything with my brother or niece.. she'll pick silly arguments to create distant between us. Example: she called and asked if i needed anything from Walmart. I asked her if it wasn't to much trouble to get me some ham and cheese from the deli. Which she did with no problem. Then she went home and told my brother she was running in there for her things and I made her get ham and cheese from the deli in her work uniform knowling she doesn't like being in her uniform. Or picking up bday cakes.. normally that's my responsibility but I asked my brother because the bakery in across the street from his house. I paid for it they just needed to pick it up..so I didn't have to drive 15 minutes that way and 15mintues back. So he agreed. She flipped saying I was irresponsible and he's always picking up my slack. Well after numerous of these small blow outs I stopped asking for anything even if they offered. Today was her Bachelorette party and I wasn't invited. Which of course bothered me because even if me and you aren't the coolest, she is getting married to my brother. I had heard that it was going to be just friends from work going and no one else. When pictures started to come out I see there 3 or our mutual friends. I felt a sense of sadness not being part of this and anything else that has to do with the wedding. I decided since she didn't want me to be a part of this day. Not even out of commitment. Then I won't be a part of any of it. It doesn't matter if I go or not. My mom is forcing me to be in attendance with my husband and children for my brother and niece. AITA for not going to my brothers wedding? "

today coworker is on a tear telling me about being upset about a situation involving her trying to help her future in-laws that put her in a mildly annoying position w her baby not having the diaper bag or something. she is savagely overreacting in much the same way my beloved would. i am at my desk painting a 40k mini and half-assedly listening and fire off ‚ÄúBABE, the baby would have been completely fine!‚Äù in the exact way i would have replied wife. story ends and we chuckle because of my slip of the tongue.

i tell my wife the story at dinner because (imo) it‚Äôs lighthearted and silly. she is very unamused and remarks that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsus‚Äù and that she believes that i am now romantically interested in coworker. i‚Äôve attempted to explain and clarify and have even apologized. didn‚Äôt mean to upset anyone. saw it as completely harmless. really don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm the asshole here but i could be wrong.

amitheasshole,AITA for not staying overnight at my uncles funeral?,44,2025-04-28 05:58:41,19,"
I (F20) and my younger brother (M17) who I will call Jack, used to live with our bio mother. My older brother (M22) Kevin was a troublemaker and a mama's boy and lives with bio mother still. 

When I turned 16, I moved in with my Dad after running away from home with Jack. They fought for custody, and my Dad won full custody. During my childhood, my bio mom was mentally abusive and, at times, physically and would bring people over and make home unsafe. I've been no contact with her, Jack has some contact with them both.

At the funeral, I knew my bio mother was going to be there, but I went for my uncle and Jack. When we got there, people were grieving. I stood and began to cry alongside my aunt, who I went with.
My bio mother took this opportunity to walk up to me and hug me while my uncle was right beside me in the casket. I couldn't refuse in front of everybody and disrespect my uncle who valued family, so I hugged her back and walked away.

Afterwords when we were eating, she approached me and Jack. I have a restraining order that I have to go to her first before she can contact/talk to me. She completely ignored that. I felt immediately triggered and sick to the stomach as she tried to make small talk like our history didn't happen and tried to pry into my life. I left that table after some time to talk to other family, but she was persistent and kept talking to me all day.

I wanted to leave before dark so I pulled Jack over to the side and told him I was done and wanted to leave now because our bio mother left to get something so she wouldn't be able to ask why and pressure us to stay.
He kept asking me, ""Can't we stay longer?"" Even though he's aware of how I feel and we talked about it beforehand. Kevin overheard heard and came over, He asked why I wanted to leave, and I finally snapped.
I told him, ""I can't stand seeing her, I only came for uncle. I tried to push through, but she kept talking to me, and I just wanted to leave while she's gone. Jack wants to stay. He can, but im leaving."" He told me,""That's unfair. She's your mother. After all she's done for you, you're just going to be selfish and leave uncles funeral because of that? She's your flesh and blood. She's your mum. You can't hate her!""
Jack started to chime in and support what he was saying and pressured me to stay overnight with him. I was incredibly frustrated and betrayed, I was hoping he would have been respectful of my feelings and maybe even defend me, but he just ganged up on me with Kevin.
I stormed off and asked my aunt to leave with me, and Jack came along reluctantly. 

Now he's upset with me, and I'm pretty sure I've just found out he resents me more than I thought. He's upset at me for ""making him leave early."" Even though he's in contact, he still feels awkward with them without me there in support, so hes mad I didn't stay longer for him. So, AITA?"

Today was our schools culture festival my class was hosting a grill and their class was hosting an escape room, 4 years ago A told me that they had a secret but they told me it will take them some time to tell me, which i responded with ""Ill wait for you"", like i said its been four years since that and yesterday night got a message which said ""Tomorrow at the festival ill tell you what i hadn't for so long"" i didn't understand their message at the time and brushed it off...which i shouldn't have done.

Its the day of the festival and i was working at my classes stalls me and Amia had also invited some friends over who we'll call K(18F) and M(18F) who were supposedly waiting for me with A once i finished i went to our meeting spot where K, M, and A were waiting for me, that day we did a lot of fun stuff, we ate my classes grilled foods, watched a play, went to A's escape room, and more. Once the festival ending i changed and walked around with A until they told me to go wait for them at the rooftop as an emergency that needed them had occurred, so that's what i did i went to the rooftop.

I was waiting at the rooftop for A when i heard the door open, i turned around to see if it was them but...It was a few male classmates of A who we'll call Male Classmate's A, B, C, so i played no mind to them, but they started talking to me, Male Classmate C bringing up how i was A's friend and all that but i still didn't care about what they had to say...but then Male Classmate A said ""Do you feel like your a boy too?""...at first i thought it was some sick joke...but i realized...i heard the door open it was A they looked horrified they ran, i ran after them.

i listened to A rant to me about their feelings before they turned around saying ""Sorry that i couldn't tell you"", ""sorry that i was scared"""" and ""sorry that i hide things from you...Sorry"" before running away leaving me alone in the hallway. So AITA?"
amitheasshole,"AITA: I told my mother I probably won't bring my kids to my brother's wedding, despite her wishing for them to be there.",549,2025-04-27 15:37:39,314,"TL:DR - Mom called me to ask me to bring my kids to wedding, I told her we have to yet decide, but since my older daughter is going to be at summer camp around that time, we have to find out if logistics of getting her to wedding makes sense and if she even prefers to go there over spending time with her friends (daughter is 10). My mother got upset and cried.

Longer version: I am 35 and I have been with my GF for around 12 years, we have two daughters, we never plan on getting married. We are not religious (neither our parents) and we do not see point in getting married. My younger brother (25) is getting married this summer and we got invited to the wedding.

My mother called me the other day about somethign that had to do nothing with the wedding and at the end of the pohone call she mentioned I have not filled in some form that you access via QR link on the wedding invitation. I kinda assumed our presence is given since we are family, so I did not bother to fill it out, but I told her I'd check it out and fill it in.

She suddenly says, that she would wish we would all go to the weddin (us and our daughters). I told her I have to check schedule of my older daughter, since she is signed up for summer camp (we did reserve it like 3 months prior) where she goes every year with her firends and that if the wedding will be mid-term I do not think it makes sense to bring her to wedding. My mother says ""I do not ask you for much, so you could do this for me"". So I stopped her and told her, this is not about her or me, but about how my daughter wishes to spend her summer and that as I said prior, I would check the schedule, ask her and let everyone know how we decided. She says, that if I put it like this she understands, at this point I m thinking we are settled and phone call would be ending.

But no, she suddenly says something like ""Well I do not know how many brothers you have but..."" (My brother is my only sibling) To which I respond that yes, because it is my brothers wedding I do intend to attend the wedding, but I am not sure about my children. Since this is about 3rd or 4th time I am explaining it to her I am getting slightly frustrated and agitated and I do raise my voice. Mind you I do not shout I am just very firm because we are going in circles. When I explain the same thing to her for that 4th time, she suddenly asks why am I so rude to her, that she hopes she is not being rude to me and that she thinks she does not deserve such treatment. I expalin to her, that I am getting furstrated with explaining same thing to her over and over and that I might be grumpy but I am not angry. She cries and hangs up.

Now I do not think I am an asshole, but thing about assholes is that they are not aware of the fact they are being assholes, so I come here to ask.

Further caveats, my mother might have slight narcistic traits and she is very controlling. She can see my daughters whenever she wants, but she rarely does, she lives 5 minutes away from us."
amitheasshole,AITA for calling my girlfriend out when we watch movies together?,32,2025-04-28 06:50:31,164,"Me (M22) got into a bit of a argument recently where she (F22) has this thing where she doesn't seem interested in any of my movies that we watch. She'll end up falling asleep usually 30 - 50 minutes into one of my movies, or just doesn't pay any attention what so ever. I try to get around this by asking her if she's watching or wake her up, but most of the time I end up turning the movie off cause it doesn't make any sense to have a movie night together if only one of us is watching. 

Normally, I'm not one to get upset, but it doesn't seem fair that whenever she gets to select her films, i actively engage in them and watch them, but she can't be bothered to do the same towards mine. I understand if she doesn't want to watch them, but she should just tell me, instead of falling asleep or not pay attention half way into it. It makes it seem like she doesn't care about any of my interests at all. 

I finally called her out on it and she basically made it seem like I was the asshole for calling her out on it cause she was tired and sleepy. but the thing is, it quite literally happens every single time we watch something that I'm really interested in. So I'm not sure exactly what to do. AITA? 

TL;DR GF doesn't bother watching any of my movies together, while i actively watch hers, says me an asshole for calling her out on it when she's just tired. "

I'm assuming he usually uses the bike, but it's so far before the class starts it's kinda not my problem. However, if he had asked or said anything even slightly nice I would have been kind and even moved if needed. I‚Äôm also confused because the first guy was so nice and was the one that told me I was good to do my thing. I don‚Äôt really care what bike I use, I just picked one in the completely empty room.

amitheasshole,AITA to the cinema without my friends.,2,2025-04-28 21:27:37,14," 
Okay, to start this off me and my three other friends go to the cinema once a month to go see a new movie. This time it was the Minecraft movie, and we'd been planning it for a week and would go to see it on Saturday. Unfortunately, two of my friends told us that they couldn't come with us and that they spontaneously had a vacation planned and only told us the day before, so me and F (other friend) decided that we would just go by ourselves, since we'd been planning it for a week anyway. 

So we went out, deciding not to tell my two other friends as we didn't want to make them upset. The movie was great and we had a really fun time, throughout I did feel really bad and was getting really nervous about my two other friends finding out, F told me it would be okay and that 'they cancelled anyway' so it wasn't our fault. Fast forward to the bus ride home and we both get a message from one of our friends, asking if we were just at the cinema (we are all on this tracking app together), I felt so bad that I'd immediately apologised, they proceeded to ignore me for the next few hours.

Am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not forcing my daughter to go on a school trip,144,2025-04-27 21:45:25,96,"AITA for not wanting to force my daughter to go on a school trip

So I live in germany and basically our school system is very strict atrendence is mandatory feild trips are mandatory even international trips are sometimes mandatory and there's little exemptions. This might sound a bit unbelievable but the german education system has a lot of crazy parts to it.


I have a daughter 13f and she is an introvert doesn't like going on school trips or really any big social activity. So our school has a 3 day school trip coming up (it's within germany) and it's mandatory for all to attend. Our school didn't do mandatory overnight trips until now but they've started and they're going to do it every year.

My daughter really really does not want to go and she begged and pleaded with me not to. I don't really want her to go unless she's confident either but what can I do?. The school has made it mandatory for everyone to come. The only exceptions are for financial medical or homesickness reasons. My daughter isn't homesick she's just an introvert so she can't get an exemption. I talked to the principal but he refused to give me a exemption.

My daughter was getting really worried that she'll have to be forced to go and I'm worried too because even if she misses this one what's she going to do about all the other mandatory school trips coming up as she gets older.

I know my daughter is going to hate going on the trip and it would upset her a lot. I told my husband that we should probably move to a different state that isn't so harsh on this (the rules wary by state) some are more relaxed. But my husband is harshly against moving and thinks it'll be a waste of money. But I think it's the only way we can make sure she isn't forced to go on one of these trips.

I talked to my freind about it and she said I was making things worse by trying to help her escape instead of just easing her fears but I don't want her to be forced to go.

AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to help buy my mom a security camera system after her poor decisions?,374,2025-04-27 16:27:48,72,"My mom is moving to another state soon because of a bunch of bad decisions she made. Over the past six months, she‚Äôs been on two international vacations ‚Äî despite not being financially stable ‚Äî and she recently broke up with her boyfriend because he thought all the traveling was irresponsible (especially since she sometimes asked him for financial help with these vacations). She said he was being controlling over her right to travel.

Now that she‚Äôs back from her latest trip, she‚Äôs completely broke, and obviously, her boyfriend is no longer around. It really sucks because this was the first time I ever had a father figure in my life, and it was the first time I saw my mom happy with someone.

This isn‚Äôt new behavior ‚Äî growing up, I watched her make terrible financial decisions time and time again. I went through periods of food insecurity, and several years of watching her be financially abused by one of her ex's due to her bad decisions. It‚Äôs frustrating because I feel like everything she‚Äôs dealing with now was 100% preventable.

Now, with Mother‚Äôs Day coming up, my sister reached out asking if I would pitch in to buy our mom a security camera system for her house since she will be gone for several months. I told her no. I don‚Äôt want to support or enable the choices that led her to this situation. I also already agreed to check on the house every few weeks (which I already dont want to do because her house is an hour away from me, and again I dont support the choices that led to this).

My sister thinks I‚Äôm being cold-hearted, but I feel like there‚Äôs a difference between being supportive and being a doormat. I love my mom and wish her the best, but I cannot support her decisions. My sister points out how my mom has had a hard life and she deserves to travel and have fun, and that her situation right now is not her fault, but i disagree.

AITA?

edit: shes moving to the other state for a job opportunity, but will be keeping her home here."

When he moved, he left a lot of things behind, but after a couple months he came and got some of it.  That's been almost 6 years ago. I've kept in loose contact with him over the years (we had 6 cats together and I've kept him in the loop about them, their health, deaths, etc). Each time I asked him about getting his items, he'd give me the whole ""Oh I'll come in a few months to get them"" then never show.

Now some of the items are unique: some pictures his mother painted, a bar with glassware set, a set of tall corner tables, family christmas decorations. The rest is generic crap.....clothes, books, etc. The stuff has been in my unused formal living room for the entire time and I'm tired of looking at it all and want to finally get things straightened in that room. The last time I reached out to him, I got no response.

He would tell me about how he feels like he needs to into a relationship now, because he feels lonely. Luckily for him, a girl had a crush on him and they started dating, and while I had my reservations on getting with someone so quickly after, I held my tongue. During his past relationship, he used to use me like a therapist a lot because I was friends with his ex, and I would often have to console him due to his nerves about being in a relationship with my friend. 

We haven't messaged in a while, but he calls me and tells me he thinks he doesn't feel a spark with the girl he's with, despite it being perfect on paper. I tell him, if he doesn't feel a spark, then he shouldn't be with her because it's important to have connection. Later on, he messages me saying he was bugging out for thinking that about his girlfriend and that she's realistically the best he can pull and blames me for encouraging him to break up with her. I start tweaking out and telling him I'm not his therapist and all actions he takes are his own and I go pretty hard due to the build up of resentment of having to deal with his relationship issues when we only JUST started to talk about me more in out friendship. I do feel bad the girl, but I wasn't trying to break them up, but I just thought it would be better in the long run if he's with someone he genuinely really likes with no doubts. AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for being annoying to my friend after they were being quite the toxic friend?,3,2025-04-28 17:51:53,16,"It started when I was just being friends with this particular friend and then gradually getting more and more toxic.

For example, this friend would get the rest of our friend group to run away from me in an attempt to get away from me for just exiting. I wouldn't even be contributing to any conversation and they would just sprint off when I'm not looking.

Another example is, anything that I do or anything that comes up this friend will instantly sexualise it and make it weird to a point where I am actually disgusted by it and want to leave.

To backfire at this so called friend I have been quite annoying but not too much to the point that I am feared that I am toxic.

For example, I will comment about this friend to the friend group when they do something stupid or something on purpose or lying. Not behind this friend's back only when they are there.

However, since I started doing this this friend has slowed down on the weird things and running away. I would say our friendship is healing.

My question is that me doing this as sought of payback does that make me just as bad as him. Or have I taken it further than it should have. So Reddit AITA?"

We have always had open and serious conversations about our lives, but (obviously) never specifically about how we look.

Recently a lot of girls I know have been getting Botox and Juvaderm.
I'm not sure if it's always been happening but now my age group is finally taking part or if its a social media pressure of looking a certain way.

My friend looks botched.
Her lips are puffed up beyond her natural lip line and her cheeks and under eye are so round it looks like she is wearing a mask.

I love her dearly as a friend and at the end of the day I don't care what she looks like, she is my friend and her personality shines through, but I'm wondering if I should t ell her that she should get some of her filler dissolved because she looks unnatural,  (serious uncanny valley vibes) because I owe her the truth or would I just come across as rude. 

She lives in a different city then me so we often travel to see each other, I don't want to ruin a trip by starting off with ""hey you look fucking insane"" but I also don't w ant  to end it like ""I have been looking at you all weekend and you need to fix your face"".

I might be the asshole because whatever do what you want.
But I also might be the asshole because she has filler blindness and the people charging her money are the people telling her she looks good so obviously they're biased and I am obligated as her friend not to be silent."

amitheasshole,AITA for trying to help without being asked? (netherlands),3,2025-04-28 16:54:45,28,"I've lived with my landlord for 5 months. Ocasionally when the washing machine is done, I'd take out the clothes and hang them out to dry. My landlord never said anything good or bad about it. In fact, she hardly even says hello to me. But maybe 3 times she gave me food randomly, even though I \*\*didn't ask\*\*.

My landlord doesn't really speak english but her daughter does, I've spoken rather often with the daughter in the past 5 months. I've recently helped out in the backyard. The daughter found out that I was hanging her mother's clothes to dry after the washing machine cycle. ""my mom can hang her own clothes"". I asked ""did she complain that I hanged her clothes"". The daughter had a talk with me before, telling me that I should ask first before doing things, this was in relation to me putting a sofa coushin in the washing machine, and she got mad at me, saying that the washing machine will break. It obviously didn't break. She didn't comment anything about it, no ""thanks"" or ""I told you not to do it but you did it anyway"". And I don't like being treated like an idiot who needs permission for any miniscule thing.

Anyway, I hanged landlord's clothes to dry, daughter found out, I asked if landlord was complaining about it, daughter got defensive ""how is a comment about it, complaining? Instead you should have answered ""oh  alright I will do that, I didn't know"" ""don't take things negative"" ""there is no need to do that again""

like hanging clothes out to dry is a great engineering feat that I need permission to ask. Or as if I spied on her personal phone.

And the next text she said she left me some candy.

I told her she's upset over something trivial, and she gets even more defensive and upset, I said ""I'm gonna do it anyway"" (hanging clothes to dry, because I'm not gonna listen to someone who's being unreasonable over nothing) and she gets even more mad saying I don't respect personal space, ""Don't. Touch. Her. Stuff."" ""I will tell you personally if you don't understand boundries.""

The other day she accused me completely randomly, by stating that ""she's taken"" and her mother, the landlord ""is taken"" even though I didn't ask. I offered to go out and grab lunch with the daughter. I know she has a boyfriend. She assumes that I'm looking to kiss anyone who has a vagina because I'm a man?

She gets so  extremely  upset over something so trivial. We live in netherlands, I come from romania, I thought it's normal to help out room mates and share chores if possible. Like cleaning dishes or vacuuming.idk she gets defensive over nothing, maybe she read one too many stories about creeps sniffing girl's panties or something, or she's controlling, or maybe in netherlands people are used to be stone cold and never help each other no matter what.

When I see the landlord again, I'm gonna ask her if she was upset that I hanged her clothes to dry. I can't believe I'm even making a topic about this. So ridiculous.

I (20M) have been running a D&D module online for a while now, but I‚Äôm considering stopping it abruptly because my partner has gone into multiple depressive episodes because of it.

During sessions, they get talked over and ignored. If an NPC asks them a question, someone else will often butt in and answer instead. The same thing happens during general conversation ‚Äî both in and out of character ‚Äî where they‚Äôre talked over, ignored, or have their conversation ""stolen.""
I‚Äôve talked to the other players about this behavior, but it feels like nothing has changed.

The other players do seem to be having fun, but I hate seeing how depressed my partner gets after each session, especially since D&D is one of the few hobbies we can actually do together.

Now I‚Äôm thinking about ending the server and starting again with a different group.

So, WIBTA if I ended the campaign because of this?

EDIT 1: should of mentioned that the group are also our friends, one of them is also my brother which makes it more difficult on us to end it, and 2 of the members were originally friends introduced by my partner and they feel like the people who he introduced have now replaced them with the other members."
amitheasshole,AITAH for using 2-Ply toilet paper?,10,2025-04-28 11:39:00,26,"Like many, our family is feeling the global economic strain. We‚Äôre not rich or poor, just comfortably uncomfortable. Most months, we only budget for necessities like utilities, groceries and transport. Sometimes, we can afford better-quality necessities, not luxuries.

At a weekend get-together, someone made a snarky comment about our toilet paper. Earlier that day, I‚Äôd bought a special on a luxury 2-ply brand, spending $0.37 per roll (normally $0.45). They argued $0.06 1-ply rolls from another retailer were a better deal. I disagreed.

The rolls they were referring to I have tried in the past. They're made from recycled paper. They're rough, and caused us issues: discomfort in the nether regions and plumbing blockages. We also used twice as many of those rolls per day than I would have with the 2-ply. The month we used the cheaper paper, we spent $3.60 on rolls, $70 on medical care, and $55 on fixing the plumbing, totaling $128.60. That‚Äôs $4.20 per roll, 11 times what I would‚Äôve spent on the 2-ply.

When our friends left later that evening, my husband mentioned that they felt I was flaunting our wealth but I was just trying to make a point that buying cheaper quality doesn't always mean you are saving money.

He suggested I hide the 2-ply in the future when friends visit.

Am I being out of touch? AITAH?

amitheasshole,AITA for not paying for my (28m) GF‚Äôs (25f) nails after she went through some trauma?,152,2025-04-27 18:46:51,184,"Longtime reader, first time poster so bear with me. My (28m) gf (25f) went to go get her nails done as usual. But this time she got a new nail tech and she had said some odd remarks with some attitude that could be justified as racist imo. My gf demanded to reschedule to get her regular tech and the lady told her she must call in to set an appt (couldn‚Äôt do it in person). Understandably my gf left furious and a little embarrassed being treated this way and she was explaining me the situation as she went to another salon. I was out of town for work and I tried to consol her as best I could bc being in that situation sucks and enraged she was treated that way.

She eventually got her nails done but they were more expensive than what her regular tech charges so she asked me to pay for them. I said no to paying for the whole thing but offered to pay half. I usually pay for things when we go out so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm stingy with my money, it‚Äôs just that money is tight rn with mortgage, bills, etc and trying to reach a goal saving up. Keep in mind that she lives with me and I solely pay for all the bills, never offered her to pay 50/50 or anything at all. I bought the house so I pay for all the bills. We work in the same profession so we make roughly the same amount annually and I know her expenses are significantly lower than mine since she doesn‚Äôt pay for housing bills etc. So I didn‚Äôt think it would be such a big deal, or so I thought..

Now she‚Äôs been ignoring me for about a week and when I bring it up she says everything is fine but I know it‚Äôs not bc she doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge my existence. And she‚Äôs saying I don‚Äôt care for her because she experienced this trauma and I didn‚Äôt pay for the nails. AITAH for this?"

We don‚Äôt have a ton of money, but I‚Äôve been saving up and for his 13th birthday his Dad and I were going to get him a Nintendo switch.
The problem is that my stepson just got in trouble at school, which he never has before. I don‚Äôt want to say exactly what happened but it‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs been bullying another student. I was bullied pretty significantly in middle school and it‚Äôs not something I want to reward my stepson for so I returned the switch and got a full refund. I figured we‚Äôd get him something smaller and maybe reevaluate where he‚Äôs at over Christmas.
But now my husband is mad because he thinks returning it is an overreaction, and I'm mad because I thought we would be on the same page about this. He‚Äôs even been hinting to my stepson that we were going to get him something big but I decided he doesn‚Äôt deserve it. It‚Äôs causing a lot of tension in the house and its making me think maybe I overreacted because of my own past.

Because of this I decided to invite some family out to dinner to celebrate. I chose a steakhouse and when my cousin, Aria (32f) found out it was a steakhouse called me to let me know that I had to pick a different restaurant. When I asked why she explained it was because she was vegan, gluten-free, and also has a few allergies and couldn‚Äôt trust that they wouldn‚Äôt cross-contaminate her food. I explained to her that there were vegan and gluten free options and we could let the restaurant know of her allergies so everything would be fine. She refused saying it doesn‚Äôt make a difference and told me if I don‚Äôt pick a different restaurant she wouldn‚Äôt attend and hung up.


This has happened in the past as well, whenever I want to go out to a restaurant whether it‚Äôs for an event or a birthday she has an issue with it and has been doing this since I was younger. I remember when I turned 16 she told my parents that I had picked a restaurant she couldn‚Äôt eat at. Because of this my parents let her pick where we went for my birthday and she picked one of my least favourite restaurants and I had no fun. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt really care if she attends or not so I texted her and let her know that I wouldn‚Äôt be changing the restaurant. Because of this shes been going absolutely feral and texting others to not attend because I‚Äôm being inconsiderate. I‚Äôve been asked if maybe I can change the restaurant for her preferences but I denied.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my brother he's not an adventurer?,1132,2025-04-27 06:42:46,444,"I (39YOM) am a former soldier who served 2 tours in Iraq and 1 in Afghanistan, plus heaps of other deployments around the world to pay for his education. Post EAS I worked for 2 years on an oil derrick in the North Sea. I've done aid work in Belize, Rwanda, D.R Congo, and Nepal. When I was 15 I hiked all through Thailand as part of my school's hiking club. This is not a humblebrag, but to provide context for the rest of the story.

My brother M has done none of those things. He went straight from high school to university on a trust fund from his grandfather (we have different moms) and has worked at the same accounting firm for the past 3 years.

The other day M was at my place for dinner. He had recently returned from a holiday in Vietnam. He was showing my son - 9YO - all the pictures he had taken, and telling hhim all these embellished stories of seeing crocodiles while sailing down the Mekong, or eating live snakes at a night market, and other nonsense.

As an aside: for the past 2 years M has done this. He'd go on some Contiki tour overseas, be a tourist the entire time, then come home and tell my kid not just about the trip, but also add all these bullshit details to make himself seem like an adventurer. 

At one point he was talking about how his tour bus got stopped by a group of armed tribesmen in the jungle, and the conversation went like this:

Son: ""Wow uncle M weren't you scared?""

M: ""A bit I suppose! But it was more exciting than anything - I suppose adventure just appeals to some of us...""

At that point I lost it. I didn't raise my voice, but through gritted teeth I told him how despite having done any of the things I'd done when I was younger I never tried to pass myself off as brave or adventurous. Hell, every time I told my son of my deployments I'd always emphasize how frightened I was and how out of depth I felt the entire time because the last thing I want him to do is to join up when hes older thinking its some grand adventure. I told M that we were happy to hear of his travels, but he was an idiot for embellishing it to the extent he does just to impress his nephew and that in all of his trips he was a tourist not an ""adventurer"".

He said something like ""well I suppose everybody's definition of adventure is different"" before changing the subject entirely.

Later that night I get a text from my dad saying that M had told him what happened, and asking for my side of the story. After I told him, he told me that while he agreed M needs to quit his bullshitting, the way I went about it was still un-called for. I reminded him that it was grandfather's stories about fighting in the Pacific in WW2 that encouraged me to enlist and wind up with TBI, hearing loss, and the back and knees of a man twice my age. I was trying to protect my son from going through the same thing.

My old man just goes ""yeah well you were still a fucking dick about it"" then hung up.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my boyfriend not to visit his family?,13,2025-04-28 06:11:45,55,"I‚Äôm a 29-year-old woman working a full-time job Monday through Friday, plus two weekends a month from Saturday to Monday. On the weekends I‚Äôm working, my boyfriend (30) usually spends time with his family and comes home Sunday night. Since I work weekends twice a month, I don‚Äôt get home until Monday night after heading straight from work.

The issue is, when I get home, I notice that almost none of the chores have been done‚Äîaside from maybe the dishes and a load of laundry if he needed work clothes. I‚Äôve asked my boyfriend multiple times if he could handle the chores before leaving for his family‚Äôs house or at least come home early enough on Sunday to take care of them. Once his workweek starts, he‚Äôs usually too tired to get much done around the apartment.

This has been going on for months. I‚Äôve brought it up repeatedly, explaining that it‚Äôs really stressful to work all weekend and then come home to a list of chores waiting for me. Even during our regular routine, I feel like I handle more of the ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù because he claims he doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to clean properly. I‚Äôve told him that this makes me feel unheard and unappreciated‚Äîwe‚Äôre supposed to be a team.

Now, whenever I bring it up, he‚Äôll say things like, ‚ÄúStop being mean to me,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm close to my family.‚Äù I‚Äôve even overheard his siblings calling me controlling. On top of that, his family has mentioned they don‚Äôt feel like we visit enough or that they don‚Äôt see their son as often as they‚Äôd like. But from my perspective, that‚Äôs not really fair. Every weekend I have off, we make a point to visit at least once. And when I‚Äôm working, he still stays over at their place from Saturday to Sunday.

Lately, I‚Äôve started to feel a bit resentful‚Äînot just toward him, but toward his family too. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the wrong for feeling this way. I also don‚Äôt think this is something worth breaking up over, but at the same time, it worries me. In the bigger picture, it makes me question whether I can really count on him when it matters.

Now my niece being cool and calm just let it happen and didn‚Äôt say anything. My dad on the other hand told my girlfriend kid hey leave her alone and go over there to try and get the two girls away from each other. 
My girlfriend‚Äôs daughter runs over to her mom crying. My girlfriend goes over to my dad and asks her what happened. My dad tells her and she says and I quote ‚Äúoh she just thinks that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do‚Äù mind you my girlfriend or I didn‚Äôt see what happened.

Fast forward a few hours later. My girlfriend texts my dad a huuuuuuge text message questioning his parenting and how dare he yell at her kid (which he didn‚Äôt). My dad ended telling her okay next time there is an issue I will come and get you. Mu girlfriend wouldn‚Äôt accept this. She wanted my dad to apologize to her daughter a four year old who forgot about the incident a minute later if that.

 AITA for cutting off my friend? She likes to argue with me and literally everyone else in her circle. I thought it was just her personality. However, it drains me. Every time we talk, she argues with me and takes the opposite side, whatever we‚Äôre talking about, whether it‚Äôs weather, health, politics, people, experiences, anything really. I could say I‚Äôm cold and she would say no it‚Äôs hot.  It‚Äôs mentally draining and I‚Äôve just been patient with her for the past year because sometimes she‚Äôd be super sweet and give me gifts. It started out good, then got worse. I noticed she likes to humble me when I talk about myself, argue against me as if there‚Äôs a problem, or just have this weird animosity against me where she makes passive aggressive comments.

amitheasshole,AITA for skipping my friends wedding due to her behavior,10,2025-04-28 05:56:24,7,"I‚Äôm 34 (F), and my former friend, also 34, used to be one of my closest friends. Still, our friendship was marked by frequent arguments, usually sparked by her very high expectations and her frustration whenever something upset her.

A while ago she announced her engagement and asked me to be her maid of honor (MOH). I was thrilled for her and agreed, but I explained that my schedule was packed- I had a full-time job plus extra classes, so I could only help with small tasks. Honestly, I never wanted the MOH role in the first place, since I dislike being the center of attention and I‚Äôm uncomfortable organizing events, but I tried to be a good friend and promised to plan her bachelorette party.

Months later, she was stressed about finding a wedding dress and asked me to spend a weekend shopping with her. Because of my studies I couldn‚Äôt, so I offered to take a weekday off work instead. She ignored the offer and sounded disappointed.

Later, she told me what she ‚Äúexpected‚Äù from her MOH: organize games, manage her guests, and look after relatives who speak a language I don‚Äôt understand. I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that. I was happy to help her personally, like taking care of her needs, helping with her dress, handling the bachelorette party, but I didn‚Äôt be the wedding‚Äôs entertainer and be responsible for guests and things to work out during the ceremony.

She exploded, calling me the worst friend ever. I tried to explain that her demands were giving me anxiety, however she basically told me to suck it up because that‚Äôs what she expects her best friend to do on her most important day and that I should be honored being the MOH at all. My suggestion to ask someone who actually enjoys those tasks was dismissed. Eventually, in frustration (after a longer fight), I said I didn‚Äôt want to be the MOH at all. At some point she agreed, I sighed in relief and we stopped talking for a while.

When I landed a great new job, I still texted her to share the news. She mocked me and sounded jealous, we had a fight and stopped writing again.

About a month before the wedding I felt guilty and reached out: no one had arranged the bachelorette party, and I offered to help. I told her that she¬¥s my friend and I still want her to be happy. She insulted me again, saying it was anyway my duty, but now it was too late and no one would come. I disagreed and suggested meeting to talk things through and said I didn‚Äôt know whether I should even attend the wedding without the conversation. She never replied, so I didn¬¥t go to the ceremony.

The day after the wedding she messaged, ‚ÄúWhere were you yesterday?‚Äù I never answered and that was it.

amitheasshole,AITAH For Yelling At Being Disrespected?,22,2025-04-28 01:20:11,85,"So, recently, my fiance (34M) and I were talking on the phone and I had told him that since I'm the only one at home the next day (yesterday, at the time of writing) I'd be taking a day off from my phone. Just a mental reset without any disturbances. He agreed to it before our last conversation of the night.

Fast forward to just after noon yesterday and he'd called me a dozen times since I woke up. I only answered the last one to try and find out what the emergency was that had him calling me like that when he knew I planned on being off my phone for the day. He didn't tell me anything out of the ordinary and we even sat in silence for a couple minutes. He then got upset when I told him I was hanging up because I didn't want to be dealing with bullshit that day. Things escalated quickly with me reminding him he agreed to it the night before and him accusing me of not saying anything about it. I accused him of not listening when both the night before came up and he kept acting like he couldn't hear me when the call started (4x I had to repeat myself). 

When things got so heated he started talking over me, I hung up the phone. He already knows that full on yelling over each other is something I don't tolerate from anyone, kids or adults, ever. 

Am I the Asshole?

Edit to add: my fiance and I (36F) call the beginning of a conversation ""bullshit"" on a regular basis and is the norm for us. Neither of us likes it, but we both do it to find out how the other is in the moment.

Our dynamic is usually great and works for us; we've been together for nearly 10 years. We already know our dynamic isn't for everyone. In the beginning, we laid out what we each expected and would not tolerate. We are still together and spoke last night and again this morning. 

DND mode was on, but that doesn't stop me from seeing how many times and when a person called my phone. It does put my phone on silent and removes the vibration of it.  

I'm not going to break up with him over a single issue. We've both had each other through much worse than this and we both love each other. 

I did start off the conversation with my expectation to not be on the phone that day and he kept calling so it made me think there was an emergency. He admitted that it wasn't. 

The question is: AITAH for yelling? "
amitheasshole,AITA for posting a package for my friend when it was overpriced?,8,2025-04-28 06:26:00,10,"Me (Brazilian) and my friend (British) live together in Canada. The other day they asked me to post a return package for them as they would be working that day and I needed to go to the mall anyways.

Our deal was, I would post it and they would pay me later as they didn‚Äôt know how much the postage would cost.

As a Brazilian I am aware that all the packages I send from here to home are usually very expensive. My friend is also aware of this as they are British and they always complain to me about how much more expensive it is sending from Canada to the UK instead of from the UK to Canada.

They didn‚Äôt tell me how much they were willing to pay for the postage, neither how much they paid for the clothing in the return package.

Once I was at the post office I was surprised with the price of 160CAD, but I have payed around that amount to send things to Brazil and I knew that it could be expensive to send things from here to the UK, so I posted it.

When my friend saw the price they were also surprised and told me it surpassed the amount they paid on the clothes and that they should‚Äôve told me to not post if it was above 70CAD.

I apologized and they said it was okay.

Later on I went to talk to them and they only said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk right now, I‚Äôm mad at you about the money‚Äù they explained that they were tired from work and hadn‚Äôt slept well so they didn‚Äôt wanna talk now cause they would be rude about it.

I was caught off guard but tried to say that I was feeling bad about it and they didn‚Äôt need to pay me back, but they insisted on not talking now and went to bed.

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that they work on the ambulance line and it‚Äôs hard to get a hold on them when they‚Äôre working so I didn‚Äôt try to message them when I was at the post office for that reason. Also that is why they were irritated and tired after their shift.

I feel stupid for making the postage when it was clearly overpriced and I wanted to know if I am the asshole for doing so.

Update: Thanks for making me realize I was not in the wrong. We talked and they will pay me for the price I paid and if there‚Äôs a next time we will establish all the details beforehand so this doesn‚Äôt happen again. "

Okay so I'm still a teenager and was even younger when this happened. I've always had a bad relationship with my mom. We would constantly argue and overall i just wasn't really happy and didn't feel very safe in the household. I mainly called cps to just try and get help for my mom's and i's relationship. I didn't in any may mean to criminalize my mom. Cps was really supportive and said that they could get me and my mom therapy together although when my mom got the news she freaked out to say the least. She started screaming at me and telling me how i ruined the family. She even told the whole family on her side how bad of a child i am and convinced everyone to hate me. It was chaos at home when it started and after about 3 days i moved out and went to live with my dad instead. For about 2 months i tried to fix and repair the relationship with my mom but she wouldn't budge. She would keep telling lies about me and insulting me. It's now been a year and we've completely lost contact. I understand that the cps call to my mom may have been a scare but i didn't have ill intentions and even cps clarified that to her. But maybe I'm not seeing the full picture so AITA? 


Edit: i thought I'd also bring up some examples of what she did leading up to the call and after. When my parents got divorced she started first of all just not caring about me. For years after that we would get into daily screaming matches over little things like me forgetting to take out the trash. She was also really really controlling, never letting me express myself in anyway. She would never ever care about my feelings and when i tried to for example express how i wasn't doing well mentally she would get angry at me cause she didn't wanna ruin her image. She also refused me mental help. I needed to go to a psychiatrist and my therapist deeply explained that to her yet she didn't care. A more recent thing she did (aka after the moving out) was that when i finally got a diagnosis for my mental health she denied it and even called the doctor to try and make her change it."

Feeling conflicted over my decision and would love some judgement on if I‚Äôm making the right decision or not.

One of our close friends (W) would like to take the open room and be added to the lease when it renews. However, W‚Äôs current lease overlaps, and they let me know they will not start paying rent until they move in, which leaves me and my 2 remaining housemates paying a higher rent for two months. I think it is fair that W should start paying as soon as their name is on the lease, as we are keeping the room reserved for them. 

We will not charge them for utilities, water, WiFi, etc since they won‚Äôt be here to use it, but I think asking them to pay rent is fair. We already tried this once, and W explained that they just couldn‚Äôt afford it as they are between jobs and that double rent was not financially possible for them, which makes me feel like a bad friend who values money over my relationship with them. But I‚Äôm not in a great financial situation myself and paying more for two months will impact me a lot.

We met at work and bonded over how awful the environment was, and became quick friends after. 

It didn't take long for her to become my best friend, and we only got closer when I went through a very traumatic breakup that spring. We spent all summer going out and partying and having fun. We did things most 21 year olds do and had a blast. 

By fall, I had met a man who I fell for, and we got engaged. 
My life quickly took a turn towards maturity. 
We bought a house, got a dog, and started discussing making a family after the wedding. 

It was about 3 weeks before the wedding that m would constantly ask me to go out and party with her. I would tell her no, as I simply do not have time for this in my life. 
We were trying to finalize selling my husbands rental to buy our own house. We had gotten a puppy who took up a lot of my time, and we were trying to plan a wedding. 

I would try to invite m to do small things, like getting our nails done, or shopping for the wedding and she always declined and said it was too boring for her.

She had a weird view on friendships having to be like high school. I'm talking pillow fights, hot coco, talking about who's the cutest in class till 2am, irresponsibly drinking, ect. 
Id tried to mention that I'm starting to grow out of it and I want to spend my time building something for myself. 

It all came to a head when she found out a coworker she had a crush on was in a relationship. She was being very disrespectful to this guy who was just trying to be nice to her. (she was the manager at her job so I told her dating coworkers wasn't a good idea anyways) 
I told her stalking the poor guys socials wouldn't make him fancy you much more and she yelled at me for not being there for her during a hard time. 

I stopped talking to her all together, I was very tired by constantly demanding my time. 
She texted me 3 weeks later saying she wants to talk in person. 
I told her I wasnting going to drive an hour to see her (she refuses to drive to where I had moved) just to solve something we could talk about over the phone. 

She then lit up on me, calling me a bad friend, and said how ever since I got into a relationship my priorities changed. 
I very respectfully told her that's what happens when people get married. And that I was wanting a friendship that's more mature than going out drinking and having slumber parties. 

She then accused me of using her for fun over the summer and how she can't be friends with me if there's a man in my life because apparently that's all that matters to me. 

I was honestly pretty insulted. I literally tried to find time for her and it was always not good enough or fun enough.
At the same time I did value our friendship and I do miss her a lot. I don't really think Im in the wrong here but that's just my perspective and if I am wrong for this I want to make things right. 
So AITA? 

Edit: man this is way more devise then i thought it would be, but let me clear some things up. 
I was growing out of our friendship before I even met my husband. 
I was focusing on working Because I wanted a promotion at work and she was constantly complaining about me working too much. 
She was super obsessive about me and would text me extremely long paragraphs while I was at work and would get upset when I couldnt read them all. 
I had offered multiple multiple times to hang out with her and she would decline because it wasn't a full on sleepover. 
She would get jealous of me having other friends. We used to be a friend group of 3 other people and she cut everyone off to just be friends with me because she quote ""couldnt handle seeing me be friends with other people."" This was when I started to feel overwhelmed by her and take steps back. 

When we I met my husband we would go on double dates every now and then with a guy she was talking to. It's not like she just stopped seeing me. 

Also the comment about how it's impossible to buy a house at 22,my husband isn't 22, I am. He mainly bought the house. He owned a house previously then moved to my area and sold it. We used every penny from that plus more to buy a house. He just has a really good job, that's all. "
amitheasshole,AITA for joining the military without telling my grandma first?,57,2025-04-27 19:08:45,47,"For context I am 17 f and currently about to Graduate from high school, I live with my grandma, 66 f. Me and her had been arguing for about a year but this happened back in November and I wanted an outside opinion.

So back in late November, I had decided that I wanted to join the military and follow in my dad's footsteps (he was a marine, which will be important later), and I didn't want to tell my grandma first since she had told me that I couldn't do the military back in Junior year when I tried to tell her I wanted to join, so I decided to tell my dad, currently 49 m, about it and told him I was wanting to meet the recruiter with him present so he can ask questions I won't know anything about to ask, and he agreed as long as I told my grandma when I decided. When we met with the recruiter, I decided I wanted to go along with this path and join the military. I told my grandma that night and she was, as I expected, not happy about it but accepted it. I thought that'd be the end of it but she forced half the family to not help me and she said that she is kicking me out as soon as I graduate from high school and that since I want to make big decisions without her, that I'll turn to my dad now. I told my dad about it and he said that he would take me in after I graduate so I could stay before I go to bootcamp. I took extra shifts to save money and avoided my grandma when I could. She didn't help with anything but expected me to invite her to my graduation ceremony, which I'm not, but I'll invite my dad. But am I really the A-hole for not telling her first?


UPDATE:

I saw some confusion in the comments and I wanted to help clear it.

1. My grandma is my dad's mom, they don't have a very good relationship.

2. I am inviting my grandma to my HIGH SCHOOL graduation, not my bootcamp one.

3. My dad is my primary guardian, not my grandma. 

Hope this clears it up."
amitheasshole,AITA For telling my sister ‚Äú It‚Äôs her bathroom too ‚Äú,31,2025-04-27 22:49:54,8,"So I and my older sister both live with our parents. We both pay rent. Now I get that I am not perfectly clean but I like to believe I am at least moderately clean as when it comes to keeping my spaces clean. Like a lived in type of clean. The shared bathroom is a problem area for me because despite how clean I try and keep it. My sister does not try at all. Toothpaste all over sink and mirror. Clothes on the floor and so on. The only time she‚Äôs cleaned the bathroom is if she knows I‚Äôm having company over.

So today they were going out to get laundry detergent so I just asked my sister if she can buy a cleaning spray. So I can clean the shower. She replied saying if I was gonna send her money to buy it. I said that I didn‚Äôt have the money so she I said ‚Äú Well then how do I buy it, It‚Äôs hard already with buying detergent‚Äú. I said okay and was already walking away and she said something that I can‚Äôt remember but I replied back with ‚Äú it‚Äôs your bathroom too ‚Äú with no attitude or tone, just calmly saying a fact. And that just made her erupt like I just called her a string of slurs. I‚Äôm always buy the cleaning supplies so I thought asking her to buy a spray wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal since I‚Äôm the one that cleans. 
My mom is telling me I shouldn‚Äôt say things like that, but I see nothing wrong in what I said. So now everyone is upset with me, my sister is cleaning the bathroom out of spite, ( she just organized and put a few things away, no change really)

amitheasshole,AITA for talking about my weight loss plan at work,8,2025-04-28 05:57:34,9,"I used to wrestle in high school, so I'm very familiar with what would probably be considered extreme weight loss/gain. I went from 190 pounds (86 kg) to 150 (68 kg) in about 3 months a couple years back and have done several 20 pound losses in about the same time period since then. I don't pretend to be super healthy, and whenever I'm asked about my diets/workouts, I always put a giant disclaimer that I actually wish that I had the dietary discipline to maintain a stable weight, instead of the cycles of \~6 months of steady weight gain -> couple months of concentrated weight loss. But I know how to lose weight and have the willpower to stick to it.

Not sure if this is super important, but I work at a hospital as a nurse. During our lunch in the breakroom, I was talking to a coworker friend and she commented that I'd lost 10 pounds since last month and asked how I did it. I gave the disclaimer and then went into explaining my diet and workouts, and then we started discussing modifications for her lifestyle since she's interested in losing weight too.

I don't think we were being overly loud, but it's not like we were hiding it either. Just a regular conversation that could be overheard.

One of our coworkers did overhear it and reported us to the manager, saying that my methods triggered her since she had past experiences with eating disorders.

The manager wasn't really supposed to tell me who it was, but me and her are chill so she just told me who it was and said not to talk about it in front of her.

Which I'll follow, I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable unnecessarily. At the same time though, I feel like I didn't do anything wrong. Nothing I said or suggested was outside the boundaries of common medical advice. It was completely related to diet and exercise, I didn't suggest any unhealthy methods or even stuff like saunas because I personally find them too annoying. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to leave?,0,2025-04-29 00:57:06,50,"Today, during lunch (in school), I sat down at a table where my friend was sitting. It was in another building, and there were around 10 other people there that I knew, who had no problem. I, and someone else next to me, started to watch a ""conspiracy"" video about MLK. (my friend usually watches videos with us as well, so I sat next to him because he might want to watch as well.) The volume was low, as I knew there were other people.  To be clear, I am 100% sure nobody there cared, and most of the other people didn't hear it either. It was only my friend. I knew all these people well enough for them to tell me to stop. My friend was watching something else on his phone (using headphones). He then told me to go somewhere else and watch it. I asked why, and he said it was because he could hear it. So, I then turn it down (to around 3 level volume on my phone, and I unpause it. But this wasn't good enough. He said that he could still hear it. I was surprised, as my ears are excellent, and his are a lot worse than mine. Since he was watching something else, I figured that he wouldn't be paying attention, and the little to no noise it would produce wouldn't matter. Yet, this wasn't good enough. He said that he had heard enough conspiracies from his uncle. After a little arguing, I would then reluctantly move.

amitheasshole,AITA for doing a reading at my Auntie‚Äôs funeral,10,2025-04-28 03:37:08,12,"My (38F) Auntie Barb died little over a week ago and her funeral is tomorrow. My mom (63F) and all her siblings were raised very catholic but as far as I knew only my Auntie Barb still attend Catholic Church and was a practicing Catholic. I am not Catholic, I sometimes attend Quaker meeting, but I am for all intents and purposes, not religious, and can be frequently heard talking shit about the Catholic Church when the topic arises.

A few days ago my cousin (38F and Auntie Barb‚Äôs daughter) texted me and asked if I would be willing to do a reading at the funeral, I obviously said yes with even thinking about, I‚Äôd do anything for cousin right now. I got an email from her dad (my uncle) with the list of readers and instructions and that was that.

Yesterday, out of nowhere, my Auntie Cathy (66F) sent me a text asking me if I was doing a reading. (Auntie Cathy is also the sister of Auntie Barb and my mom.) I said yes, and didn‚Äôt think much of it. Because Auntie Cathy doesn‚Äôt have much emotional intelligence she kept sending more weird and confusing texts finally saying she thought it was ‚Äúweird‚Äù that I was doing a reading. I thought she was making a joke, so I started joking about it too. It became clear from her bizarre responses that she did not find it funny as was getting angry.

Confused as hell I called my mom. Long story short Auntie Cathy is still a practicing Catholic, and apparently it‚Äôs very offensive to Catholics when non-Catholics participate in Catholic Mass. Who knew? 

Now that I understood why Auntie Cathy was being weird as hell I texted her to say: hey, my mom explained why you might be offended, not trying to offend you, just trying to support my cousin. I also suggested that if she had a problem she should speak directly to my cousin and uncle who were planning the funeral service. Auntie Cathy
did not have polite things to say back to me‚Ä¶.

I think Auntie Cathy should have either contacted my cousin/uncle to express her concern, or minded her own business. But it seems she thinks I should not have accepted the position in the first place and thinks I should decline and not read at all. 

There is so much more family dynamic drama, but I think summarizes fairly. AITA if I say nothing to my cousin and just do the reading as planned? "

amitheasshole,AITA for offering my ex wife and her bf a trip using my vacation points?,147,2025-04-27 12:05:08,53,"AITA for offering my ex wife and her bf a weekend trip using my vacation points?

I, 40m, and my soon to be wife, 39f, have a vacation package that we get X number of points for per year to use to travel to resorts. My soon to be mentioned we should send my ex wife, 44f, and her new bf, 45m, away for a weekend using our extra points. 

A little back story here, we all get along just fine. Me and the ex have been divorced for a bit and get along great now that we are divorced. Everyone who knows us commends us on how well we co parent and how they wish they could get along with their exs as well as we do. Her bf was a friend of mine from back in the day and one of the best men I know. Very polite and a gentleman at all times. He is wonderful with my kids and overall is a good person. 

With that all said I have a lot of extra vacation points that will expire soon and with my ex wife's birthday and mother's day so close together we thought it would be a great idea to send her and her bf to a resort for a long weekend. She is a school teacher and school is almost out for the year so her schedule is about to be wide open. So I texted her bf and said what we would like to do for her and what we needed to do to make it work into his schedule. That way if he needed to take vacation days or whatever we could accommodate that before we booked it for her. Well his response was not was I was expecting and he declined the offer entirely because "" I'm not real into taking a vacation on my girlfriends ex husband's dime"". 

In my mind the trip was more for her to celebrate her birthday and mothers day at a resort for free not really about how he felt about it. Also it's not going to cost me anything because the points are already paid for and they are just gonna expire. If anything I lose money by them not taking the trip. 

Not trying to cause any issues I just said I understand and will think of something else to get her to celebrate those days. 

So AITA and did I cross an unwritten rule?

She was riding my most exspensive horse, it Cost 2500 kr (almost i think 250 dollar) it can get a bit wet but not to wet. Not in to a lake.

She has not talked to me in 4 monts. I Asked her if she could pay me 500 kr (50 dollars i think)
She has much money and my mom is friends with her mom, and her mom keeps asking her if she can give me money bc she dosent answer me. At school she startede a rumor about me. The rumor is that i sleept with a 60 year old man. That is NOT true and is mean to try and ruin my life. My teacher has talked to her and her teacher, but she keeps saying that it is not her problem and I have to deal with it.

amitheasshole,AITA For calling out a lady at the dog park?!,316,2025-04-27 05:56:20,76,"So I go to the same dog park consistently, my dog has a group of friends and me and the other owners get along. We each throw balls brought from home (obviously different from a normal tennis ball) for our individual dogs with no issues. One day this new dog shows up in the time we all go and the dog will growl and nips at the other dogs until they drop their balls. And then the dog runs around with the ball for like 20 minuets. Which isn‚Äôt a huge deal. But at some point like I would like to get back to throwing it. This own never plays with her dog or brings a ball. After 30 min of nicely asking the dog to drop my ball I look at the owner and nicely say ‚Äúcan you see if you can get it from him‚Äù

She rolls her eyes and calls her dog‚Äôs name but the dog keeps running from her with no recall. After awhile she gets it back, hands it to me and says ‚ÄúBe careful, He‚Äôs just going to keep taking it.‚Äù I say, ‚Äúoh, you should figure out how to control your dog then‚Äù she scoffs and sits down eyes on her phone as her dog does the same thing to other dogs. The other owners get annoyed too and won‚Äôt throw it when she is there. Everyone else including me will try to get it back quickly and be polite. It seems like that‚Äôs the etiquette.

We didn't see her for a while after that until today when I had to go later than normal. I‚Äôm throwing the ball and on my dogs way back to me, she shows up, my dog drops the ball at my feet and when I try to grab it her dogs growls at me and snatches it. She just walked away. For 20 minuets I try to get it back. Again this is mine and clearly not a cheap one and it‚Äôs the only ball my dog will chase. I ask ‚Äúcan you please try to get my ball back‚Äù she rolls her eyes and for over 30 minuets stares at her dog saying nothing until I say ‚Äúso you still can‚Äôt control your dog‚Äù she looked mad and starts trying. She calls the dog‚Äôs name for 15 minuets. And can‚Äôt really get it back and I have to give her one of the treats I bring for my dog so she can bribe her dog into giving it back.

I had a friend with me and we wrap it up after I get the ball back. He asks why and I loudly say while looking at her ‚Äúoh she can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to train her dog and she thinks it‚Äôs my fault so we should just go.‚Äù She gets noticeably mad at this and I can hear her loudly ranting about it to some random guy. This guys dog and my dog shared my dogs ball no problem earlier btw. 

This is frustrating to me and l will continue to call this out but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm in the asshole. I know they are dogs, I know this happens. But blaming me for her dog taking my ball and her not being able to get it back seems crazy to me. A dog having it for a bit and then dropping it or running with and playing with my dog is one thing but being possessive and never giving it back seems like behavioral issue especially when the owner can‚Äôt control it. This dog is a large husky and growls and nips at any dog and now human! Am I the asshole for calling her out?"
amitheasshole,AITA for saying something to my fiance?,76,2025-04-27 13:16:31,74,"I want to start off by saying my fiance is an amazing man. I'm truly happy that he cares about the people in his life. However, recently there's been some things going on that have just put a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'm just crazy and being dramatic. 

It was my birthday a few weeks ago, and he very kindly got me a couple gifts. He got me some Tupperware containers and a package of make up wipes. I worked on my birthday and was kind of tired afterwards, so I didn't ask to do anything. 

The following weekend, my fiance of 3 years asked to take me out to dinner to celebrate my birthday. I was really excited to celebrate with him, as well as just to spend some time with him. 

I, however didn't want him to feel like he ""had"" to take me out for my birthday. I told him I was more than happy to go on a hike or cook us a meal at home. He said that he really wanted to treat me because I deserve it. 

He chose the restaurant and we went and had a good time. When the bill came, he said, ""Hey, can you put this on your card and I'll send you money?"" 

I didn't think twice and I handed over my card, and I left a tip in cash. He looked at the bill and said, ""Oh that's not even bad."" 

The next day, he sent me a little over half of the tab. Not including the tip. 

I don't expect him to buy me stuff, take me out, or to ""treat"" me so to say. I work full time as well as 2 part time jobs. I take care of myself, and if I really want something, I buy it. 

Maybe I'm being over dramatic, but it just put a bad taste in my mouth, and doesn't necessarily sit right with me that he had me pay and only sent me around half of the bill. 

If he didn't want to pay for the entire dinner, I was would have been more than happy to split the check. Or even make a meal at home like I offered. 

I tried to stop thinking about it until last night. 

He informed me that he's taking a vacation with his parents to celebrate his dad's birthday. Which is great, I want him to have fun with his family. However, according to him, he's the one paying for the play to stay in it's entirety, as well as son and father activities. 

His brother's birthday is coming up, and I watched him put together some REALLY thoughtful gifts for him. I think it's really kind of him, and I'm glad he wants to make it special for his brother. 

He then informed me that in a couple weeks he's treating his brother to a special birthday trip. Again, that's great I want him to enjoy time with his family. 

Maybe I'm just being dramatic, but it doesn't necessarily sit right with me that he didn't even want to cover dinner, that he offered multiple times. Even when I offered to do something else. 

I haven't said anything yet, but I don't want to come across as ungrateful.

amitheasshole,AITA for only inviting one of my siblings to my wedding?,15,2025-04-27 22:14:29,57,"I (28m) getting married on Friday to my partner (28f) of 7 years. The ceremony itself is going to be quite small, only including close friends and family, 2-3 guests from each side. My side will include my mum, sister and best man, and my partners will include 2 of her friends, and her mum. We are private people and this is an intimate affair hence the small numbers. The ceremony will be held around midday and later that evening will be the reception where the wider family will be more than welcome to attend. 

The issue is I've invited one of my sisters to the ceremony and not the other. The reasoning behind it, is I've been in regular contact with my closer sister, and the other sister I haven't really spoken to her in over 10 years, aside from mild chit-chat at Christmases. 

I've told my mum about my decision and it do not go down well. There was a lot of crying, saying she was worried about how this will affect my relationship with my sister. When I tried to explain my reasoning, that we don't actually have a relationship, that I don't even really know her anymore, and that if it were any other day I don't believe I would even cross her mind. She said that it doesn't matter and that our relationship will be ruined.

amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to meddle in a fight between my friends ?,62,2025-04-27 13:52:02,31,"
For a while now one of my friends has been distant from our friend‚Äôs group. Lets call that friend Felicia (F21). While she still talked to me she didn‚Äôt want to hang out as long as our two other friends were here (let‚Äôs call them Mia F21 and Lana F21). At the beginning of the we figured that she was feeling bad (she had recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia) and the three of us were there for her all summer and kept making sure she knew she wasn‚Äôt alone.

A few months later tho she was being very distant, we figured she might needed some alone time to process what was happening. Mia and Lana know how to give a person space better than I do so I still kept on texting Felicia from time to time, she answered but very coldly. A few more weeks passed and she was now being very cold and sometimes even snappy to Mia and Lana, so I invited Felicia to dinner in order to break the ice. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she felt like they weren‚Äôt there enough for her and that she was disappointed in them and a little bit in me too. She said that she felt like we didn‚Äôt take her illness seriously enough and felt alienated from the group because of that. She also said that she didn‚Äôt feel like she was being considered as highly in the group as the others. 

She told me to repeat this to the girls but I refused. I was frank and told her that it shouldn‚Äôt be me. She used to this a lot when she was in a fight with someone she would tell everything to someone and then tell that person to go and repeat it to the concerned person. I dont think its a healthy way to do it and its a bit childish. I told her that she needed to speak to them herself and that the best I can do is warn them that she needed to talk to them and organise a sort of meeting. 

She got mad and called me a jerk because I wasn‚Äôt respecting the way she wants to express her feelings. I usually own up to my mistakes but this time it doesn‚Äôt really feel like one ? So AITA here?"
amitheasshole,AITA for how I responded to my mom?,3,2025-04-28 05:59:38,11,"This is a fairly minor conflict, but it's happened several times, and I'm confused

The conversation for reference:

Mom 11:15 PM: please switch laundry?

Me 12:45: The washer wasn't started before, i started it

Mom 1:04 AM: sleep i‚Äôm worried for you 

Me 1:22 AM: I don't think you worry for the right reasons, I don't understand why me being up right now is an issue. Especially because I'm going to sleep regardless quite soon. It's not a school night for me, and even if it was, I get a ton more sleep than everyone else I know

Mom 1:22 AM: That is a weird reaction *name*

Mom 1:23 AM: I didn't yell or do anything

Mom 1:23 AM: I just said you should get some sleep it‚Äôs 1:23 am

Me 1:23 AM: It's not meant to come off as rude? I'm just curious. I think i could act better in the future if I knew why it is that you said you were worried

Me 1:25 AM: I'm not trying to talk back or whatever, I just want to understand 

(No further response from mom even though she is definitely awake)

Further context I suppose:
I was doing a homework assignment before heading to bed when I got this text from my mom. I think she said it because I responded to her text at 12:45. It's possible she heard me up, but I wasn't being noisy; I was just doing an assignment on my computer. 

This isn't the first time she's said she was concerned in regard to my sleeping in situations where I felt it was entirely unwarranted. I get 8-9 hours of sleep on school nights, and probably 10-11 on weekends. In fact, I get significantly more sleep than I used to. This year is probably the most sleep I've consistently gotten since I was a kid, and I don't have an inconsistent schedule or anything. I don't have any medical conditions that would make me need more sleep than average, and I'm not a bad kid. My schedule is different than hers because I wake up at 845 for school to take the marta there, and she wakes up at 7 for work and to get my little brother to school.

Since I was genuinely confused why she was concerned (if I knew why, I could maybe work around that in the future to not worry her), I responded and asked why she was worried. Now, it's possible my tone wasn't great? But I don't think her response was proportional to what I said. 

But I don't understand why she responded the way she did. Did I say something wrong or react weirdly? From my perspective, all I did was state that I was confused and why. I don't understand her perspective enough to share it. 

I just wanted to know what I was doing wrong since this has happened several times before, and I don't understand

recently, my cousin Nova (32F) announced that she‚Äôs getting married this summer and invited me to her wedding. i‚Äôm happy for her, and i really want to support her. but here‚Äôs the thing: the wedding is going to be fancy, and there‚Äôs a dress code with specific colors and styles. i don‚Äôt own any formal clothes like that, and the thought of having to buy a whole new outfit stresses me out. i‚Äôve looked online, and decent dresses are way out of my budget.

on top of that, Nova sent out a wedding registry and said that everyone should bring a gift off the list. i know a gift is expected, but again, i can‚Äôt afford anything that‚Äôs on there, not with how tight things are right now. i can't even afford anything I need for school

so, i decided to be honest with her. i told her that as much as i‚Äôd love to be there and support her, it‚Äôs just not possible for me financially. I explained that the dress code is out of my budget, and that I can‚Äôt afford a gift off the registry, so i wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend. i tried to be as respectful as possible, but she wasn‚Äôt happy. she said it was ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù and that ‚Äúfamily should support each other‚Äù and that it wouldn‚Äôt be the same without me.

now, my parents are upset with me too, saying I should go regardless and either figure out how to get a dress or just put a gift on a credit card. they said I can‚Äôt miss family events like this and that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime‚Äù thing for Novs.

but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to go into debt for a wedding when I‚Äôm already struggling with basic expenses. i can't show up out of dress code because nova has said how they're spending a lot of money for this moment to be right

AITA for not wanting to go to my cousin‚Äôs wedding because I can‚Äôt afford the dress or a gift?

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my (24NB) partner (26M) to stop giving so much unsolicited advice?,1,2025-04-28 10:35:30,37,"Hi everyone! First time poster. 

My (24NB) partner (26M) have been together for almost two years.

It‚Äôs worth stating that he‚Äôs not doing it out of bad faith at all‚Äîit‚Äôs never snarky or intended to be condescending‚Äîbut often, he will give advice on things that he has little to no personal knowledge or expertise about and with little context about why someone might be doing/going through something. It‚Äôs almost like an instinctual jump to ‚Äúbe helpful‚Äù whenever someone is venting to him. He also occasionally physically takes over a task that I am already doing if he sees me doing it and wants to help, which I‚Äôve told him I do not like. He still does this occasionally when he forgets himself.

I have told him before that if I need his two cents about something I‚Äôm going through, I will simply ask him (and I have, about things I know that he knows or if I need his input). Any other time than that, I‚Äôve said that I would appreciate his support but not necessarily his advice or his help (because it is often general and a little contrived; annoying to receive in times of stress). He always apologizes and says he‚Äôll do it less, and it has gotten better throughout our time together, but occasionally it still crops up and I do have to gently remind him that he doesn‚Äôt need to do it.

This is a habit that I‚Äôve noticed is not exclusive to me: he does it to his siblings, people he just met that day, coworkers he doesn‚Äôt know that well, etc. 

Recently, he made a new friend at work and was really excited to invite them and their partner over for dinner (my partner and I live together). I was excited for him because he‚Äôs had trouble making and maintaining friendships over the past few years for different reasons. At the end of his shifts at work, he‚Äôll often be on the phone with me already as he‚Äôs leaving the building, and while on the phone, I heard him giving his new friend advice on communicating with their partner (unsolicited advice that they did not ask for). I could hear the new coworker friend become a bit defensive of their partner, but the conversation remained civil and friendly. 

Later, when he came home, I asked him if I could broach a potentially upsetting subject with him and he said yes, and I told him that I knew he was geeked about making a friend, so it might not be a good idea to start this new friendship with the precedent that he‚Äôs someone who doles out unsolicited advice‚Äîa habit that can be a little condescending in nature, if not intent. He said he didn‚Äôt do that with this new person and that he would appreciate if I let him do his thing. I told him about the conversation I overheard when we were on the phone at the end of his shift, and he seemed to become sort of deflated and anxious. He thanked me for my honesty, but seemed subdued for the rest of the evening before bed.

I feel a little bad, but honestly, it‚Äôs probably the thing that has caused the most arguments in our relationship and I want him to start on a good foot with new friends. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA For confronting my mom about how she‚Äôs making me feel insecure about my body,5,2025-04-28 03:00:02,18,"just wanna say sorry for the grammar and punctuation I‚Äôm actually horrible at it!

I 15 F and my mom 48 F have never really gotten along. Yes, we have our good moments, but it‚Äôs very few as of recently. I for one have never been insecure about the way I look or the way my body looks. I‚Äôve always been super confident in how I look and feel but I think my mom has some different opinions about the way I look I‚Äôm 5 foot 2 and I‚Äôm 127 pounds. Yes I know I could lose some weight but whatever I‚Äôm happy with myself. I play sports, I eat relatively healthy, except for the every once in a while unhealthy candy bar. every time I go to the doctors they say I‚Äôm healthy. I‚Äôm just curvy that‚Äôs all‚Ä¶ my mom on the other hand does not see it that way, and says that I never try to make myself look good and that I‚Äôm just making myself look like a pig. These comments are where the issues started...

As of a couple months ago. She has started looking through my lunchbox before I go to school making sure that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have disgusting snacks in my lunch‚Äú and when I tell her that she doesn‚Äôt need to worry about what I‚Äôm eating and that I‚Äôm doing fine she just says that she just doesn‚Äôt want me to gain any more weight. I would just get frustrated, but wouldn‚Äôt say anything grab my lunch and go to the car. Then more things started happening. She started portioning my dinners, only buying me salads for lunch, and she started limiting my cards when I would go out and check my purchases to make sure I didn‚Äôt get anything ‚Äúfattening‚Äú at this point I got frustrated and so I decided I needed to talk to her and figure out why she was treating me like this, so last night I went into her room and asked if we could have a talk. I was very calm about the situation and I knew what I wanted to say. I told her how I was feeling and that it made me severely uncomfortable and just made me feel horrible about myself every single time she did those little things, but for some reason, it ended up backfiring on me. She started screaming at me saying that I was a horrible daughter and that I was just trying to find stuff to cause an argument. She then told me she didn‚Äôt wanna be around and to go pack my stuff for my dad‚Äòs house so I wanna know AITA for confronting my mom about this and overreacting or was I in the right?"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking the construction workers to not use my bathroom?,0,2025-04-28 18:58:18,92,"Not sure if this is NSFW but just in case.

I‚Äôm doing construction at my place and the construction workers are here from 7 to 3 pm every day.

One of them asked me last week if he could use the bathroom. If there is one thing I consider sacred in life is the bathroom. It‚Äôs my private space, it‚Äôs where I‚Äôm the most vulnerable, it‚Äôs where I feel safe, and I am absolutely revolted if it‚Äôs not proper, but the guys had been here for 7 hours, so of course they need to go at some point. I let him go and braced myself for the worst while psyching myself up to the idea that perhaps I was overreacting.

I was wrong.

The dude didn‚Äôt turn the fan on and didn‚Äôt even flush correctly, so it was absolutely disgusting when I wanted to use it later that day.

Yesterday, the cleaning team arrived and left everything sparkling clean once again. The second they left, the same construction guy knocked on the door and told me he had been waiting for the cleaning ladies to leave so he could use the bathroom again. I was aghast. My boyfriend told him he could use it and I was furious because I told him what he had done last week (my boyfriend had been traveling so he didn‚Äôt see the massacre).

He used it again a couple of hours later and then once again. I went in when he was finally gone and he left it worse than a public toilet at a music festival. It was absolutely disgusting so of course I was livid because I think it‚Äôs an absolute lack of respect to not clean after yourself, especially if you‚Äôre not even aiming correctly.

Today the same construction worker wanted to use it and I told him he could go to the supermarket across the street. He was shocked and my boyfriend told me I was being rude and ridiculous, so I had to go apologise and let them use the bathroom again.

I blew up and told him there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm apologising as long as I‚Äôm the one who either has to pay to clean it or has to clean it himself. I told him if he wants to let them use the bathroom then he better tell them they need to clean after themselves or hold it in till the end of their shift. He doesn‚Äôt want to, so we are at a standstill now.

So, tell me, AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for carrying my service dog in a purse?,1324,2025-04-26 18:58:52,429,"I (24F) have type 1 diabetes, and have a service dog to alert when my blood sugar drops. He is a nine year old miniature poodle, and I‚Äôve had him since I was 17. He‚Äôs getting close to retirement age, and he doesn‚Äôt move around as well as he used to. After a typical day, he‚Äôs wore out from all the walking by the time we get home. To accommodate this I bring a dog purse for him, so he‚Äôs still able to do his tasks, but he doesn‚Äôt have to do all of the walking. 

About a week ago we went grocery shopping, and he‚Äôs in his bag resting about on my hip. A woman with a large dog approached me and told me pets were not allowed, I told her he was my service dog, but she then starts screaming at me. People start to watch, I‚Äôm confused and embarrassed, but eventually she walks away. I continue my shopping, I believe I had made it two isles away. She‚Äôs behind me screaming again, this time with an employee. I try to tell the employee that it‚Äôs my service dog but the woman continues to scream over me. Eventually the police were contacted, and after about an hour more of her behavior she was removed and trespassed. I thought that was the end of it. 

To my utter shock, she has made 7 post on the city‚Äôs facebook page that went locally viral about me and my ‚Äúfake‚Äù service dog, completely bashing me. These are including pictures of me, videos of me walking through the store, and she even posted my car/tag. The comments were almost all agreeing with her, even though in the video you can hear me say he‚Äôs a service dog. Since these post I‚Äôve been getting harassed in public over my service dog frequently. I‚Äôve even been asked to leave restaurants and stores over this. 

With how many people are taking her side in the comments on her post I think it‚Äôs possible I may be the asshole and just need to see it from a different perspective? "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my mom her healthy eating rant was unnecessary?,419,2025-04-27 01:02:27,54,"Okay, so I (18f) and my family (brother: 11m, dad: 48, mom: 47) were having a light conversation at dinner. The topic shifted to food, and I mentioned that my grandmother once told me that when I was 3, she bought me ice cream at a local carnival. Apparently, I loved it! She also said that my parents didn‚Äôt want me trying many different foods when I was that young, but she decided to treat me to just a small ice cream cone.

My dad found this amusing, but my mom got a serious look on her face and said something like, ""Eating healthily is a life skill, and if you don‚Äôt learn it, you will be overweight and have health problems"" (obviously she didn't say it like that, but that's the message) This felt really out of pocket to me since the conversation had been fun and lighthearted up until that point.

So, here's where I might be the A-hole, I responded by saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really see how that relates to my story about eating ice cream for the first time,"" and ""you didn't need to say that because you've already done this so many time before"".

She then became upset and said, ""If someone criticizes me one more time, I‚Äôm leaving the house,"" and she stormed off. Afterward, when my brother and I were cleaning up, I asked him if he ever felt uncomfortable when mom talks about healthy eating like that. He said yes.

To be honest, I feel like this is sometimes how kids develop eating disorders/unhealthy relationships with food.

Note: About 20 minutes later, my mom came back and acted as if nothing had happened. I am going along with it.

Edit: Just to be clear, the grandmother in this post is my mom's mother in law"
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting new neighbours put scaffolding on my drive for 2 weeks,4427,2025-04-26 11:36:34,364,"Hi, a couple have recently bought the house next door to us and are having improvements done to it. The house had an extension built onto their drive, meaning they now don't have a drive and have no access to their back garden. However, there is a gate that goes into my drive but I have blocked off as they assume that they have access and have seen multiple people on my drive without asking me first.

Last week, I saw a builder knocking at my door on the doorbell camera but I was at work. He came round at 7:40 the next morning and said that they'd need to put scaffolding on my drive to have improvements done to the roof next door. I said no and he asked why. Firstly, it's my drive, secondly, the new neighbours should've come round and asked rather than telling the builder to do it. He said that the man moving in had been up multiple times and tried knocking. This was a lie as I work from home 90% of time and can see through the doorbell camera.

The couple came round the following evening and asked about it, this was the first interaction I'd had with them. However, a week prior, my partner's mum had parked outside their house to pick her and our 8 month old daughter up.  I found that a note had been put onto her windscreen saying please don't block my drive. She wasn't blocking the drive, was there about 5 minutes, and was on a raised curb which is totally legal to park on. He didn't come and say anything whilst I was there, but as soon as I went back in the house, he said something to my partner and her mum.

My main issues are that they've assumed they can use my property, didn't ask themselves and got a builder to do it, lied about coming up and knocking on the door saying we weren't in, and now wants my drive for 2 weeks when we can't park outside their house for 5 minutes, not blocking driveway which had been extended.

I know that through the ANLA act that for urgent and essential repairs they can use someone's drive. However, does this apply when they've bought a house that has voluntarily blocked their drive off? Furthermore, the house was up for ¬£270k and they offered ¬£266k. I'm pretty sure that if the roof needed to be replaced urgently, it would have been a lot cheaper than this.

Thanks

amitheasshole,WIBTA for not changing my baby shower plans to accommodate my MIL?,434,2025-04-26 23:54:39,87,"I‚Äôm dealing with some drama regarding my baby shower. My step-MIL has graciously offered to throw us a baby shower this August at her home, and I accepted. My husband originally thought this was a great idea because they live on a beautiful property. She is the only person in our lives that has offered to throw us a baby shower. I do not want to ask any of our friends to throw us a shower as I do not want to impose on anyone (it makes me very uncomfortable). It‚Äôs in no way my mom‚Äôs ‚Äúthing‚Äù, as she is socially awkward, overwhelmed easily, and incredibly busy helping raise my niece (my brother is a single dad, and her mom bounced), so I have not even asked her. My MIL lives out of state and has not offered to throw us a shower.

This is where the drama happens. My FIL and step-MIL live on the same property that MIL lived before she and FIL got divorced. Different house, same property. Their marriage deteriorated while my husband and I were in college (10 years ago) and it ended when she had an affair. She has since moved out of state because the cost of living around us was too high for her to afford. We have forgiven her and love her very much. We are excited for her to become a grandma for the first time.

Last X-mas we called her to wish her a Merry X-mas on our way to FIL‚Äôs house to celebrate. She proceeded to cry and say she should be celebrating the holidays with us, that it was her fault she destroyed her marriage, and she felt terrible that we were going to what used to be her house to celebrate with FIL‚Äôs new family. We thought she was doing better since then and getting excited for becoming a grandma. Unfortunately, MIL is struggling with her mental health again and recently started drinking again. She is an alcoholic and only drinks when she‚Äôs having a difficult time. We found out she started drinking again when we weren‚Äôt able to get ahold of her on her birthday this week and she finally called my husband a day later and told him she got a DUI. We don‚Äôt know why she started drinking again, but my husband is going up to visit her in a few weeks to help out and figure out what is going on.

I told my husband I was worried she would have a hard time at my baby shower as it is supposed to be at FIL‚Äôs property. My husband said he thinks it would be very bad for her mental health. He said we should ask step-MIL if she can throw the shower at our house or ask a friend to throw us a shower. Both ideas I am very against. Like I said, I do not want to impose on any of my friends to the point I would go without a shower. I also do not want the stress of having to clean my house and get the backyard ready for so many guests. I get really overwhelmed whenever we host and feel like I have to have an absolute perfect home whenever people come over. I know it‚Äôs not necessarily, but my anxiety gets the best of me and I freak out. I feel like it would almost be like throwing myself a shower at that point, which I also do not want."
amitheasshole,AITAH for buying a CS2 skin despite my wife's protests?,0,2025-04-29 06:50:09,94,"So I (29M) have recently gotten into CS2 due to friends' recommendations and I'm loving the game. I've been playing for 3 months and have really started getting an urge to purchase a knife skin, with the Paracord really catching my attention.

I brung it up with my wife (29F) in a quick remark 2 days ago and she said that buying online game skins are a waste of money. She believes that the money would be better for vacation savings or for our emergency fund. I disagreed but I just accepted the answer and finished washing the dishes.

Last night during a gaming session with my friends, I just decided to buy the Paracord knife. Sure, it costed $183, but I don't spend on hobbies all that often and it is my money. My friends also told me that I can resell the skin later and get my money back.

This morning, my wife noticed that I purchased it after seeing a purchase on Steam and now won't talk to me. I've been explaining to her that we can afford it, and that we aren't struggling.

I don't really know if I'm TA here because it doesn't hurt us but I guess I did go behind her back. AITA?

Edit: To emphasize a bit of info, the skin was bought at below average price and can be resold on the Steam marketplace for that price back essentially instantly or for profit if I wait a couple days.

Edit 2: Also, by ‚Äùmy money‚Äù I mean my fun money with both of us getting $150 each a month. Went over this month but I underspent last month."
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my housemate not to be loud when playing video games at night,10,2025-04-27 20:11:38,10,"I live in a shared household with 3 other people. We‚Äôre all in our mid to late twenties and all have full time jobs. There has been an ongoing issue with the guy in the room next to me playing video games loudly at night. Before I moved in he would play video games without headphones really loudly all night (shake the walls loud). After several months he agreed to use headphones and try to be quiet after 11pm, but he is still noisy, especially on weekends. I often hear him talking loudly to his gaming buddies, yelling/shouting and hitting his desk or whenever he loses, and then the occasional high pitched scream when he encounters a jump scare. For Context, I can‚Äôt hear anything when he has the TV on and/or is talking quietly. 

On weekdays he usually quiets down after 12:30/1am (which still isn‚Äôt good) but during the weekend he seems to think he is entitled to be as loud as he wants for as long as he wants. For the year that I‚Äôve been living here I‚Äôve repeatedly had to ask him to be quiet and have been polite. This weekend I finally reached my limit. On Friday night he kept me up until about 3am periodically yelling, and after he ignored my messages I had to get up and barge into his room to tell him to be quiet. Last night he did the exact same thing, and I was woken up at around 1am after he yelled and hit something (which I hate because it scares me half to death as i automatically assume there‚Äôs an intruder in the house) I lost my temper, sent him a message telling him to stfu and calling him a selfish pr*ck, and a half an hour later when he was still being as loud as ever I unplugged the router. He turned it back on immediately after. Now he is mad with me for cussing him out and disrupting his game and said I should‚Äôve just knocked on his door - as far as I‚Äôm concerned I shouldn‚Äôt even have to get up and ask someone to have the decency to be quiet when others are sleeping. 

So, AITA for being rude to him and switching off the wifi? And does anyone have any advice? I have tried white noise machine and headphones, but it doesn‚Äôt block out someone shouting. I was honestly in tears last night because I was desperate just to sleep - I‚Äôve been ill all week (throwing up with a fever), my arthritis is flaring up due to my lack of sleep, and I worked full time all week, including the Saturday shift. I‚Äôm exhausted. What do I do? All that I‚Äôm asking is that he keeps his voice down when playing. And It‚Äôs not just me, he is waking up the others in the house as well. "
amitheasshole,AITA for cancelling my visit to my niece‚Äôs birthday the day we were due to leave?,1308,2025-04-26 16:54:38,327,"I (mid-30s M) was supposed to visit my sister (early 30s F) and my niece for her 3rd birthday this weekend.
We live about 4.5 hours away by car (each way), and originally the plan was that my wife and I would drive down Friday night, spend Saturday and Sunday with my niece, and go to a birthday lunch on Sunday before heading home.

However, over the last couple of weeks, my sister changed the plans a few times - including pushing things back to just Sunday lunch rather than the whole weekend.

At the time we made the plans, I thought it was a bank holiday weekend (meaning I‚Äôd have Monday off work). I also hadn‚Äôt realised the lunch was booked for 3pm on Sunday - if I‚Äôd noticed that earlier, I would have raised concerns because it would mean getting home extremely late.

It wasn‚Äôt until the day we were supposed to leave (today) that I fully processed the lunch was 3pm, there was no extra day off, and we‚Äôd be doing 9 hours of driving just to spend a short time there - and not getting back to London until after 11pm, before a busy work week.

I decided not to make the trip.
As soon as I made the decision, I messaged my sister asking her to call when she could (she was out at a safari park with her daughter, and I didn‚Äôt want to spoil their day by dumping it in a text).
When she called, I explained everything calmly.
She told me I was ‚Äúannoying her‚Äù and hung up.

She has since messaged to say she‚Äôs upset with both me and my wife, and that she doesn‚Äôt think our reasons are good enough.

I feel bad about upsetting her, but I genuinely don‚Äôt think it would have been reasonable to do the drive for such little time, knowing how wrecked I‚Äôd be for work the next day.
At the same time, I understand it was a big deal to her because it‚Äôs her little girl‚Äôs birthday."
amitheasshole,WIBTA for making my ex reprogram all my old smart devices (or buy new ones)?,9,2025-04-27 19:38:15,8,"Following a moderately acrimonious divorce, I've just finished moving out of the matrimonial home (we shared ownership). There are a number of smart devices in that home which control lights with voice commands. I programmed and installed all of it, which took a good amount of time, and all the devices are under my accounts. For the purpose of the marriage, however, they are shared (though there is no specific mention of them in the legal agreement).

I initially planned to transfer ownership of those devices to my ex, but it's proving quite difficult to do so. Mainly because my Google account runs most of the stuff. I \*could\* look into transferring just the programming, but honestly with my own home to take care of now, I do not have the time or the energy for making my ex's life easier.

I plan to tell my ex: ""In 7 days I will remove all the devices from my accounts, at which point they will stop working. Or, I can come and take the devices. Your call."" NOTE: the lights will still work at the switch, just not with a 'hey google'. My ex will still be able to turn on the lights."
amitheasshole,WIBTA for asking my roommate to keep her dogs in her room or start cleaning up more?,7,2025-04-27 21:39:50,22,"Hello everyone, thanks for reading. I (22F) live with two roommates, Nicole (23F) and Alexia (23F). This post is mainly about Alexia‚Äôs two dogs. Nicole has two cats and I have one.

At move-in, we agreed on some expectations around pets and shared spaces. I told Alexia she could have full use of the backyard as long as she picked up after her dog, and I was flexible about cleaning as long as it was happening semi-regularly. She warned us that her dog, Jellybean, had anxiety and barked when left alone, but assured us it was manageable. Nicole and I were sympathetic. Unfortunately, Jellybean howls loudly for about 30 minutes every time Alexia leaves ‚Äî often waking Nicole and me up early in the morning. And that's just the start.

Our couch (which Alexia owns) absolutely reeks of dog, to the point it‚Äôs unbearable to sit on. I bought a beanbag to work around it, but now that also reeks. Whenever Nicole or I try to host anything, Alexia always brings Jellybean out ‚Äî even after we gently asked her to keep Jellybean in her room. At our Super Bowl party, Jellybean barked through the entire halftime show. Jellybean also shoves her nose into guests' crotches and barks at men, especially ones wearing hats, making it really uncomfortable.

At one point, I used to let my cat Mimi out into the living area when I was cooking or doing laundry. Every time Alexia came home, she would immediately let Jellybean out too, resulting in barking, chasing, and Mimi hissing. I had to stop because the stress wasn‚Äôt healthy for my cat.

Since then, Nicole and I‚Äôs cats have gotten fleas from Jellybean.

Other things that have happened:

* Jellybean threw up on my beanbag. Alexia tried to clean it in the washer but it and the throw up sat soaked for several days. 
* Jellybean once vomited in Alexia‚Äôs room, and she knowingly left it there for four hours while she went to work, stinking up the whole house.
* The backyard is full of dog poop.
* Dog hair constantly floats around the house.
* Alexia will leave dirty dishes for over a month and sometimes won't even take out the trash ‚Äî just opens a new bag and leaves the old one.

And then, Alexia got a second dog, Lemon, citing her parents moving. Now both dogs bark like crazy whenever anyone ‚Äî including me, my partner, or guests ‚Äî comes through the door. Their barking is constant, and Alexia‚Äôs only response is laughing and saying, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon guys, you know them.‚Äù

Recently, Alexia and her dogs started sleeping in the living room meaning she's always out there. We‚Äôre all moving out at the end of July, but it‚Äôs honestly been exhausting living like this. Nicole and I are both fed up. I'm planning on sitting down with Alexia soon to talk about summer logistics and my partner storing things in my room.

Would it be worth bringing up these pet issues too? Part of me feels like it‚Äôs too late to fix anything, but the other part knows I‚Äôll be miserable if I don‚Äôt at least try to set some basic boundaries for these last few months. Thanks for reading."
amitheasshole,AITA. I lost my best friend of 8 yrs over this situation.,131,2025-04-27 04:46:42,78,"
So I lost my best friend of 8 yrs over this, and I still am trying to wrap my brain over it. 

This is what happened. I (23f) and my former best friend(23f) went out to some bars with her boyfriend, her friend, and a few of her friend‚Äôs friends. 

This was a few months back on New Years. We went to some bars and celebrated. I took a few shots with her friend‚Äôs friend, who is a guy that I had just met that night. 

Once the night was over, we all went back to her friend‚Äôs apartment to chill. Eventually, my best friend and her boyfriend had left. It was just me, her friend‚Äôs friend and her friend who had brought home a guy she met from the bar. 

The guy and her were dancing and making out and eventually went off to her room. It was just me and the guy that I had just met that night who was friends with my best friend‚Äôs friend. 

We were just chilling on the couch and talking when we eventually started making out. Things got a little heated and we ended up having sex for about two minutes when I decided to stop because I felt weird having sex on his friend‚Äôs couch. So I sobered up and left. 

About a week later, I get a text from my best friend saying how she‚Äôs embarrassed and upset with me that I hooked up with a guy on her friends couch and her friend felt uncomfortable about the situation. Immediately, I felt horrible and texted her and her friend to apologize. I also texted the guy, who said his friend wasn‚Äôt even that mad at him. He said she just found it ‚Äúfunny‚Äù. 

So, another week goes by and my best friend texts me how she feels uncomfortable about me kissing her mutual friends. Besides this situation, there has been three other times I have kissed one of her friend‚Äôs friend. In each time, they all made the first move. I know that is not an excuse, I just wanted to make that clear. 

We text paragraphs to each other for the next few hours and it seems it‚Äôs going nowhere. I let her know the situation and apologize to her but she kept making almost rude and disrespectful comments. I had never seen this side to her before. We had never gotten into a fight until this happened. 

Eventually, after I kept trying to solve the situation and it wasn‚Äôt working I told her that we need a break. I was heartbroken. We haven‚Äôt talked since, but I miss her so much. 

Am I the asshole??"
amitheasshole,AITA for not committing loan fraud for my brother?,35,2025-04-27 11:54:50,38,"
Throw away account. Me (33) and my brother(39)have 5 other siblings and I've always been the black sheep of the family, but he's the only one who's made an effort to be an older sibling in any way. We had a pretty good relationship.

 My brother texted me asking for a favor. The favor was to send him some of my paystubs. He would doctor them to replace my information with his. An important detail is that before I even responded he told me that if it made me uncomfortable that he would understand and that he would still love me.

 I told him that it did make me uncomfortable, but also that i trusted he wouldn't ask unless he really needed it.He's a single dad with full custody and I know things are genuinely hard for him. He said he needed to show a lower income so he could refinance his car loan to bring down his payments. I agreed and told him that I would need until at least the next day.
 
That night I put a lot of thought into it. I'm aware it's crime. I thought hard about how to do it intelligently and came to the conclusion that we've already texted about it and already fucked it up.

 The morning rolls around and I'm scheming. It was hard. I came to the conclusion that any electronic communication about that could easily be traced back to me. Or maybe I'm just not a good criminal.
 
As I'm scheming, my brother texts me that i don't need to worry about it and that he doesn't want me to do anything that would make me uncomfortable. He again assured me that he'd still love me either way. I asked if he was sure andthat i was working on it. He said he needed it but that if it made me uncomfortable not to do it. I said that I wouldn't then and he heart reacted my reply.

 As far as the text trail goes, he had given me an out. The plan was to just say no on the texts to eliminate that trail but do it anyway. I was getting closer to something I felt was a smarter way to approach it.

 Later that night my brother texted me that he was really disappointed in me. He said that now that he's asking for help it's like the things he's done for me don't exist. He said he's never hesitated to help me because that's what family does. I wanted to tell him that i was still going to do it, just not via text. He doesn't live close so I couldnt talk to him in person. I told him that i understood and that there was a misunderstanding we would have to work out irl. I was just tired of texting about conspiracy to commit crimes.

 His response really bothered me. The false equivalence of comparing putting in a good word for me at his job vs loan fraud made me mad. So did the fact that he told me 3x that if it made me uncomfy that he would understand and that there would be no love lost. This made me feel like he's been counting up what he's done for me over the years and this also felt very much like love lost. I decided that I just wouldn't do it at all and that he could just be mad at me. But maybe I should be willing to take this risk for family?
 Am I the asshole?

*EDIT:
Some ppl are saying my brother's reasons don't make sense. That could be true. I'm not a loanologist so I'm not sure but let me add more details. He mentioned the goal was to extend his car loan to bring his monthly payment down. Someone in the comments pointed out that this would actually be more expensive in the long run. It would make sense to me that he would favor saving some money in the short term so he can feed his kids and taking the hit later in the hopes that his financial situation gets better. 
His car payment is nearly twice mine and my car is newer and nicer. I think that's probably because he has really bad credit. 

EDIT #2: Some commenters are saying IATA For considering it. I disagreed initially but I can see it now. In my eyes I'm just looking out for my brother and his young kids but I do now see that this would have had the possibility of effecting other ppl and their loans. We come from an incredibly impoverished community where crime was sometimes a necessity to survive and were already on public assistance programs but they weren't enough. However, we're not in that place anymore and he does probably have other options. Thanks for this perspective. "
amitheasshole,AITA for trying to be a good friend and accommodate for someone,1,2025-04-28 06:59:13,4,"I (M-23) have been good friends with somebody online for about five years.That friend that I've known for a while introduces me to someone that this year, who is a bit more on the sensitive side. We're going to refer to the guy that I had known for a while as Friend A while new guy is Friend B.

Friend A and B have known each other for a couple years at that point. Not as long as I and Friend A have. All three of us start playing video games together, and as far as I know, we were having a good time. 

Sometimes I get a little angry when I play video games. Apparently at one point, it had gotten to the point where I was making Friend B upset. I told him about some of my anger issues, and he seemed to understand at the time, and I told him that if there was anything at all that he was upset with me over or anything that he wanted me to work on, to just be up front with me and tell me, and I wouldn't be upset. I would try to be more mindful. It had been an on and off thing, but as far as I know, I hadn't been pissing him off, or making him upset in any kind of way for a while. We still continue to be kind to each other. And as far as I know, we could still talk.

One day Friend B decides that he's going to start muting me in calls, and I talked to him in his DMs and I try to ask him if everything's alright, and what I was specifically doing to make him upset, if anything. Like I said, if something was wrong, he could just be up front with me about it and I wouldn't care. He didn't say anything in specific at all, and he just kind of said that he wasn't enjoying my vibe. And I told him that was completely fine and he could keep me muted for as long as he needed to. 

Months go by. Friend B at one point leaves a group chat and discord that we had been in. I thought somebody in the chat said something he didn't like and I went to go talk to him about it. He said nothing anybody said made him want to leave. I then asked him if it was my fault and he never got back to me with another text. I don't think anything of it and I just think that he wants to be alone with his thoughts for a while.

I then get a DM from Friend A tonight. Us having known each other for a while felt that he needed to share this information with me. He sent me a screenshot of a conversation with Friend B. That conversation said that Friend B wasn't my friend anymore and that I didn't exist to him anymore.

After the months of work, I had tried to make a friendship work. I then find out he's been essentially behind my back saying that I'm a terrible friend and that I don't exist to him anymore. I tried being nice. I tried accommodating. I even continued to ask him if he was all right, and if there was anything that I could do to change for him for the better. But apparently, all that effort was in vain. 

So reddit, I ask, am I the asshole for trying to accommodate and essentially still being a bad friend apparently?"
amitheasshole,AITA for ignore one of my childhood friend's messages asking for money?,43,2025-04-27 10:08:16,36,"So i have this friend who frequently asks for money and promises to payback by a certain timeline. At first he did pay it by the date but later on i always had to remind him multiple times. Now i have a problem with 2 things-

1) Him not saying  ""thank you"" after i have transferred the money.

2) I have to shamelessly remind him to pay back which i don't like.

Now the reason why i feel like an asshole is that the sum amounts are always very less (INR 300- INR 600) but still something about the behaviour and lack of courtesy made me ignore his messages last two times.

amitheasshole,"AITA in this argument with my boyfriend for saying my phobia ""isn't a big deal?""",142,2025-04-27 03:05:50,94,"This might sound crazy, but I would love some unbiased input. I was having some stomach pains tonight and went to talk to my boyfriend about it, because I always get bad anxiety when having any kind of stomach upset. I have had emetophobia (fear of throwing up) since I was little and it has always had a big impact on my life. As I start explaining, he says that ""throwing up won't kill you"" and ""it's actually good for you, it's your body expelling toxins"". While logically I know these to be true, it doesn't help my phobia. I have been through all this with therapists and friends already. I just needed some comfort. He then proceeds to say ""its not that big of a deal"" which really got me upset. I explained that just because something isn't a big deal to you doesn't mean it isn't to me. I explained that it was lacking compassion for my issue. He later apologized and I took some time and forgave him. Proceed to 20 minutes later while we're watching a movie where I take a joke too far and he gets annoyed, I immediately apologize. He then completely shuts down and says he is tired of us arguing. He says he needs space so I turn back on the movie. We watch for a bit but he gets on his phone completely ignoring the movie so I try to talk things out. As I try to smooth it over he just keeps saying he's tired of arguing. I try to explain that the situation that happened where I got upset earlier wasn't necessarily an argument, but me disagreeing with how he reacted to my concerns. I feel as though I should be able to express it something bothers me. He says that wasn't just a disagreement but that it WAS an argument and backtracks on his previous apology, repeating that indeed it actually isn't that big of a deal to throw up. I say that his reaction in that situation wasn't supportive. He then goes on to say hes always supportive toward me and I say that I never said he wasn't supportive, just in this situation. He then says that he asked for space and says I did not give him that space and now I shouldn't be confused as to why he's frustrated. Now he's gone into the guest room and is not speaking to me. I'm very confused and am feeling crazy about this whole situation. Please help! 

EDIT: Since so many people are saying it's weird I didn't give details to my joke. I didn't give details because it truly was just stupid and lack of thinking on my end, but didn't think it was a big deal. We were watching Notting Hill, and a running joke that I do is teasing him about attractive actresses. I said something along the lines of you want to watch this movie just because of Julia Roberts and when she came on the screen saying there's your girl!! He plays along with it saying yes that's why we're watching the movie. I then say ""its not like you'd have a shot with her anyways"" which was my bad joke. I did not mean that as a diss toward him, I love him very much and meant it as a joke but can see how it comes across as snarky. Hence why I apologized after. "

amitheasshole,WIBTA If I was mad about/brought up how I'm mad about being denied a bedroom in our new apartment?,0,2025-04-28 04:39:08,25,"Hihi, first time poster, so pardon literally everything. Fake names used.

I (22f/nb) have been living with my 2 current roommates (18m and 18m) since September 2024. We live in a one bedroom apartment currently, with myself and who we'll call Jack sharing the living room. While Xander took the bedroom, because he's the main signer and he has a girlfriend.

We all initially moved in because of a plan we had with my (only my) previous roommate to move into a 3-4 bedroom. Which somehow turned into us taking their coworkers lease for their one bedroom temporarily bc they wanted to move out fast-

It was messy but basically it ended up with just Zack and Xander here for the first few months (before September). Then old roommate forced me to move out earlier when the other two didn't want me in the already tight space since at the time they didn't know me. We've all been cramped here, but the plan was to move into a bigger place once this lease ran out. They've since lost any resentment they've had for me (and told me so), since it was mainly old roommate who was the one who messed everything up.

Well may is coming up, and they're looking for a new place again. I thought we were buds by now, or at least cordial, and we've all already talked about staying together for financial reasons. That and we already know we get along beyond minor things so we don't see a point in splitting.

Problem is they've not included me in the conversations about apartments at all. It's them talking to each other over discord calls when they're in the house together. Right in front of me. I had to ask to be included in apartment hunting because they didn't even tell me they were already looking, I thought we were still debating if we could even afford to move yet. Which in and of itself would've been okay since I know they're eager to go, and they already game/call a lot anyways.

But I thought we had agreed on me having one of the bedrooms. Since Xander got the bedroom bc of his gf. And since we I thought all planned to be equal in this next place, I offered to pay more rent so I could have one of the bedrooms. But today Zack dropped the bomb that because he's paying all the deposits (something I thought we were gonna split evenly) he gets the room. No discussion, no nothing, just said it. I was so livid/shocked in the moment I ended up just agreeing because I didn't want to have an outburst.

I just wanna know if I'd be an asshole if I brought it up again to try and discuss it. I worry it's because they're still somehow upset with me even though I've done my part here as much as they have. I've had to be covered on rent about 3 times but so has Xander, and I've been consistent for the last 4 after I got my new job. I don't have anywhere to go if they kick me out and they know that. And otherwise they've been very kind. I feel like a huge dick for even being mad.  So I dunno. I need opinions.

Thank you very much for your time."
amitheasshole,AITA for asking girlfriend why she cheaps out on presents,0,2025-04-28 04:35:39,32,I happily extend my budget to get her numerous thoughtful gifts. Nothing too extravagant but her birthday is the same week as valentines day... you get the idea. I don't expect her to spend as much as I do but generally she cheaps out except for one Christmas 4 or 5 years ago. I appreciate that she's disciplined with her budget but ultimately feeling let down when I'm brutally reminded that she doesn't care to spend more than 30 bucks for my birthday. She claims to be confused when I ask her how she'd feel if the roles were reversed. When I really pressed her about it she mentioned I've been critical of her gifts in the past (because they were unthoughtful/just what she wanted me to have) so I guess I'm being punished for that. Ironically I never would have said those things if her gift budgeting wasn't so tight. I get that this might just be a love language issue but the vibe comes across passive aggressive.
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I don‚Äôt invite my friend to my dinner party if she didn‚Äôt invite me to her bday dinner?,12,2025-04-27 15:00:28,47,"Me and my friend, let‚Äôs call her Stephanie, have been friends for a couple of years. Last summer, I made a joke* that offended her, and she confronted me about it through text, which I apologized for.

*Stephanie is in her medical residency, so I know she‚Äôs smart, but she‚Äôs also very scatterbrained ‚Äî think Legally Blond. I know she‚Äôs great at what she does. She said something REALLY dumb that day (I don‚Äôt remember what it was unfortunately because it‚Äôs so long ago), and I made a sarcastic remark on how is she a doctor.

I guess that may sound mean but most of our friend group likes taking jabs at each other and pretty sarcastic so I didn‚Äôt realize that I had hurt her. Anyway, I apologized I also promised I won‚Äôt make jokes like that anymore. A few other girls made the same sarcastic comment to her, but they were invited to her bday dinner.

After that day, we still hangout as a group, but a less frequently (mostly because I was just traveling a lot the rest of the year). And, I always plan get togethers in our group chat, but she‚Äôs never available when most other people are. Maybe we hangout as a group like once a month.  

She hangouts sometimes individually with some girls in the group, but I never asked her to hangout individually (but never did she). 

Fun fact: We just had dinner together as a group last week.

Fast forward to this week, one of the girls in our friend group told me that Stephanie created a group chat for her birthday party that didn‚Äôt include me. It hurts me because I never singled her out and I always invite her to things (she in the group chat with other girls). I guess maybe I don‚Äôt make the extra effort to connect with her 1-to-1, unlike the others. 

Next month, I am planning a dinner party with the girls since I just moved to a new apartment.  

WITBA if I don‚Äôt invite Stephanie? Should I just be the bigger person and act like it never happened?

Last night my family went out to dinner with our grandparents. No matter who I'm with in my family this topic is always brought up. ""Do you have a boyfriend yet?"" My sister been dating her bf for 2 years. I have a gf. My parents know this. not a lot of my family does bc I don't know how they would react. My gf and I have been dating for 1 year 1/2. I tell my them that I don't have a boyfriend and leave it at that. When dinner was done my mom and I got in her car to drive home. My sister went home in my dad‚Äôs car with him.

I bring up the comment made at dinner abt me having a bf and I never know how to respond to it. We started talking abt my relationship with my gf. She was saying how much she liked her and how respectful she was. Then we started talking about my sister's relationship and how he doesn't treat her right, but he has family problems and is also very quiet just like my sister but when they are together have fun. He's bigger than her so he like throws her around sometimes. Throughout the conversation she would say something like ""Sometimes at night I pray you end up with a man"", ""I'm still rooting for Max"" (he's 20 years old, I had a crush on him 3 years ago) ""I'd rather you and gf stay together then your sister and bf."" This shocked me but I laughed along with her not wanting to upset her. We got home and went to bed.

The next day my and sister I were home alone bc both of my parents had work. Me and my sister aren't that close. we barely talk unless we are complaining abt our parents. I saw a good opportunity to talk to her and tell her about what happened. She was shocked and upset my mom would say that. We laughed about why she would say that and how out of pocket she was. Two hours later I got a text from my mom saying ""I‚Äôm really upset that you would tell your sister what we were talking about in the car. It was not your place and now she is upset with me. Not cool to do. This makes me not trust you and I can‚Äôt tell you something in confidence if you are going to run your mouth after I thought we were having a nice discussion and opening up to each other."" I showed my sister asking if she texted Mom and she said she had sent a message asking her why she didn't like her bf. I was upset and started crying bc I was scared of getting yelled at when she got home and that I would be grounded. I tried to defend myself by apologizing to my mom. Explaining how I didn't mean to upset her but she said it's frustrating bc she hears sorry a lot from me but nothing changes.

I have been trying to be a good daughter. I have therapy but I don't know why I can't be a good person. I feel horrible. Me and my sister decided to clean the entire house so our parents would be less mad at us. AITA for telling my sister what my mom said and ‚Äúbreaking my mom's trust?"""

amitheasshole,AITA: Garbage dump run gone wrong,1,2025-04-28 03:06:34,2,"AITA for asking my hot, sweating wife to load another thing for our dump run after she did all the work.

Okay, this is a silly one but it's causing some strife and we love to have minor disputes settled via strangers on the internet (or at least enjoy some validation). For context, we are both women in our 30s. 

Today my wife decided to load up a bunch of stuff into the truck and do a dump run. We've been wanting to do this for about a week and she thought it was a good day.

Yesterday her parents initiated yard work and we were both a bit bummed to not get a relaxing weekend, so today was to make up for that.

I was in the middle of some computer thing and told her I wasn't quite ready to help load the truck but I wanted to help so she didn't do it herself.  She said it was all good and I could finish what I was doing.

Once I finished my task, I searched the property for a few items to go to the dump and added them to the truck. At this point she has done 98% of all the loading.

I spotted our rusty old firepit and thought it would be a good item. As shes in the truck bed ratcheting things down (hot, sweaty) I say ''should we toss the firepit?''. She says ""definitely"". I reply ""can you grab it?"" She (irritably) says ""what? I loaded the whole truck myself, you're asking me to grab another thing?"" And I followed it up with ""but it's spider-y"" and then my sister in law had her boyfriend load it.

Now, I'm a spiderphobe through and through and my wife is the resident hero. This is a long time agreement.

Hours later she approaches me and says something you said earlier upset me but I can't remember and she walked away. I have anxiety and this made me uneasy. Then she came back and said:

""I wanted to tell you that pissed me off earlier when you asked me to do something while I was hot and sweaty"". I responded by clarifying  it was only because it was spidery, or I of course wouldve just added it myself, like the other things. But that I'm sorry for upsetting her. She reiterated it was uncool and I said I already apologized, but the way this came up was a big vibe killer and made me anxious and I didn't like that. She said she expected another apology because the first one came with my explanation. I said my explanation matters and she said she didn't want to hear it. She went to try to shower as I continued to call to her that this convo sucked for me, I already apologized, and I don't think this was worth any of this. 

SHE thinks anyone would agree it's rude and uncool to ask someone who's been working away to do one more thing, regardless of my explanation (spidery/she was already on the task/she wanted to do it today). I think that my request was no big deal, I'm happy to clarify I didn't mean to throw further demands at her and I was just hoping for some spider help. But now I'm a little upset because she brought it up so suddenly, with bad energy, and seemingly was ready to escalate at me if I didn't whole heartedly own that regardless of context, what I asked for was a big asshole move.

So, AITA for asking her to grab the firepit while she was hot and tired? And if I am, do I owe a huge apology for such obvious rudeness? Or should my simple ""didn't mean it that way, my bad, it was about the spider"" suffice? 

All in all, my side matters to me. Her knowing I'm NOT an asshole matters, and that my intention would never be to be rude to her. She doesn't care to hear of my intention with an apology and to me that feels unfair."

I was obviously sympathetic, but she called me sobbing, saying she couldn‚Äôt emotionally handle coming to the wedding because she was too devastated. I tried to talk her down, even offered to have someone bring her home early if it was too much, but she refused and didn‚Äôt show up.

It hurt. A lot. She missed one of the biggest days of my life, and I had no maid of honor. We didn‚Äôt talk much after that. A few months ago, she got engaged and just last week asked me to be her maid of honor.

I told her I couldn‚Äôt. I said I still felt hurt she missed my wedding, and while I love her, I just couldn‚Äôt pretend like everything was fine. She got extremely upset, said I was being cold and petty, and that her dog was like her child. Our parents are pressuring me to just be the bigger person.

I honestly don‚Äôt know anymore. AITA for saying no?"
amitheasshole,AITA if i don't understand why my friends upset with me,2,2025-04-28 02:05:35,9,"So, lately me and my friend have been a bit rocky (to them at least personally i haven't felt like it's been bad or different but i digress) and they vented to it to our mutual friend (their cousin).

Maybe not a good thing but that mutual friend told me what they said about me. They said how i've been distant, leaving them on 'delivered' or 'read', to me personally i don't care about being left on delivered or read. Delivered is honestly something i don't understand like why does that matter so much? But read a little more, but anyways that would be a problem right? But the thing is that, whenever i'm ""leaving them on read/delivered"" i'm quite literally always busy.

It's either that i'm at work or out with a friend/family. Whenever im at work, i obviously can't text i work in retail my managers are like hawks when it comes to employees using their phones. They'll send me a message, I'll see it on my apple watch and I'll want to message AFTER my shift. But no they use that little unsend feature apple added and delete the message. Like?? I'm sorry im at work?? Or when im out with a friend seeing a show or just anything, once again they'll text me but since im distracted i wont reply, they'll again delete it.

Me leaving them on read is something i'll admit is wrong, i dont ever intentionally mean to do it like in a malicious way. I just read it not know how to respond and not reply. But never when it's something serious, whenever i leave them on read it's because it's something random about their day that isn't serious. Maybe that's something i'll fix i'll admit but the most recent time it was 20 minutes. Left them on read 20 minutes then i replied because i was side tracked. 

It's also as if they're treating me like i'm their partner. We are not. We are friends and have been for around 5 years. They're bothered when i text my coworker crush, or when someone else texts me. Saying i'm ignoring them to text my ""work crush"". I checked messages between me and my ""work crush"" Did not text them at all whenever me and my friend were out together or whenever they said i was. So i simply don't understand. 

 I only have this problem with them. The rest of my friends who i ""leave on delivered or read"" don't see it as an issue. They all understand i work, am busy, or just don't have the energy to talk. To me, just because we don't text everyday or every minute doesn't make us any less closer as friends. 

I'm stuck on if im the asshole, and if i am or not do i confront them about this? Obviously i wont bring up that their cousin talked to me about it but a work around it. I feel like if i bring it up it'll sound like we're a couple dating and i dont want it to be like that. "
amitheasshole,AITA for confronting my friend that shes inlove with her cousin,3,2025-04-27 18:04:02,9,"
Hey Reddit,
I'm still fuming about what happened yesterday. So, my friend (18F) and I (19F)have been friends for 5 years. I've always considered her one of my closest friends. We were hanging out and chatting about soccer when she suddenly brought up her cousin - my ex. She started showing me pictures and gushing about how attractive he is, commenting on his looks and basically making it a point to talk about him.

This isn't the first time she's done this, but it was definitely the most blatant. Every time we've hung out since my ex and I broke up, she's found ways to casually mention him or show me pictures. At first, I brushed it off as her being friendly and interested in her cousin's life, but now I'm starting to think there's more to it. It feels like she's rubbing it in my face, and I couldn't help but wonder why she was doing this.

I finally lost my cool and told her to stop bringing him up. I also mentioned it seemed like she might have feelings for him, which feels weird since they're cousins. I wasn't trying to be mean, but I did want to make it clear that it's not okay to keep bringing up my ex like that. I feel like she should be supportive and understanding, especially since we've been friends for so long.

Now her whole family is mad at me, except for her parents. Her mom actually agrees with me that it's not cool to bring up my ex like that, but everyone else thinks I'm being unreasonable. I'm starting to wonder if I overreacted or if my friend was being insensitive. AITAH for calling her out, or was I justified in feeling the way I did?

I'm genuinely confused about how to navigate this situation. I value our friendship, but I don't know if I can move forward with someone who seems to be fixated on my ex. Help me out,"
amitheasshole,AITA birthday party scheduling drama,9,2025-04-27 13:15:03,15,"So ~8 weeks ahead, I (41) asked my mom (65) about dates for my daughter‚Äôs birthday (2) party. She works hospitality, often weekends. She asked for a Sunday and knewI was coordinating with others. It took awhile to confirm everyone‚Äôs availability, but I finally settled on a Sunday afternoon, the weekend after my daughter‚Äôs birthday. 

So about a month ahead of time, I sent a text with the (Sunday) date but not the precise time. My in laws all said ok great. Then my mom says she had booked a flight to Vegas for that date and could we do before noon to accommodate. I was kind of shocked and didn‚Äôt say anything right away.

My mom had previously indicated she was going to Vegas the subsequent weekend. Had she looked at the calendar she would‚Äôve seen the Sunday prior to my daughters birthday was Easter as well as my dad‚Äôs milestone birthday (parents divorced a decade, they‚Äôre cordial but not usually happy to spend time together).

So my mom calls about the time. I told her sorry but I‚Äôd already decided on the afternoon and we‚Äôd just have to find another time for a mini celebration. I specifically said my daughter doesn‚Äôt need a big party, she‚Äôs only 2. Well my mom didn‚Äôt take that well and I ended up saying I was frustrated that my daughter wasn‚Äôt more of a priority and everyone seemed to want me to schedule around them, that I wasn‚Äôt going to try to accommodate so many peoples schedules in the future, that I wasn‚Äôt mad at her per se but I was upset. She told me it sounded like an accusation and I repeated I wasnt mad at her but I was frustrated at the situation.

Now comes where I might be an AH. She said something sarcastic about her trip being such an inconvenience. I responded that she does vacation a lot and she‚Äôs the one who asked me to hold it on a Sunday. (She went on a road trip for two weeks already this year and Europe for a month in the fall, plus Vegas last spring and several weekend getaways.) She BLEW up at me screaming that she has to work so much so that her kids don‚Äôt have to take care of her and that she‚Äôs given up everything for us and she shouldn‚Äôt have to ever see or accommodate my dad again. This is super classic of my mom. She gets defensive and lashes out, really going for the jugular, getting very mean and aggressive. I remember this happened to me for the first time in my late teens but had seen her do it to my dad and others before and many times since. So after a minute of straight screaming, I hung up. Texted her I was going to block her, but I didn‚Äôt actually. She never responded to that message.

Couple weeks go by and my sisters kind of nagging at me about it, saying moms not going to be around forever. I call my mom to see if maybe by doing so we can begin to move past it. Straight to voicemail. Odd, a couple days after, I try again. Again, voicemail immediately. Google says this means she has me blocked. But not sure what to do now.

So am I the AH?

amitheasshole,AITA for RSVPing No to my friend‚Äôs engagement party,4,2025-04-27 15:44:17,40,I have friends who got engaged last August. I‚Äôve know the groom since high school and the bride since they first met. They sent out a ‚Äúheads up text‚Äù saying that the engagement party is the weekend that lines up with NYC pride back in December and they‚Äôre just sending the mail out RSVP now.  They both know that pride Weekend in NYC is the one weekend of the year where I am not available for anything that isn‚Äôt pride as 1. I am a gay 28 year old living in NYC and 2. I normally have events lined up 6 months in advance that I‚Äôm planning to attend. I feel conflicted bc they know this weekend is the one I‚Äôm never around but they both have been talking for the last year to me how I would be part of the wedding party so AITA for saying no on the RSVP?
amitheasshole,AITA for disagreeing with my partner about a question that her MIL asked?,15,2025-04-27 08:56:55,76,"I (28M) and my partner (27F) live together. 

My mother is moving to our city from across the country. She‚Äôs been quite exhausted with the move since he‚Äôs had to pack an entire house alone with minimal assistance. 

The move is complex - buying a new house here, selling the old house there, and packing up decades of family mementos and furniture in preparation. 

She finally secured a house closure date, and she asked to stay at our house for a couple nights before the formal move-in date. Unfortunately, she was unable to provide adequate notice (asking 2 days in advance), which everyone acknowledges is not ideal, but we still accommodate for. 

She asked me first, I said ofc, and communicated to my partner. Yesterday, she reached out to my partner separately to ask if it was ok with her too. My partner of course said yes, but mentioned to me that she was frustrated since it put my partner in an awkward position where she felt obligated to say yes. My partner would have rathered the call be more like ‚Äúim just giving you a heads up that i‚Äôll be staying, and that i‚Äôm sorry for the late notice,‚Äù instead of asking ‚Äújust checking, is it ok that i stay.‚Äù

I however didn‚Äôt understand her frustration. My position is that the precise choice of words matters less than the intent, which in this case is respectful communication that my mom will be staying. I didn‚Äôt think that the precise choice of words mattered here. 

i definitely lack social intelligence in many cases, and i appreciate any feedback. "
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my dormmate to pick up his trash over on a very bad day?,2,2025-04-27 19:47:34,3,"I (20M) live at a college dorm with 3 other dudes, including the focus of my frustration who we‚Äôll call K (20M). For the most part we‚Äôre all solid roommate‚Äôs with no real drama between us, but the interaction I had with him last night has been on my mind and I need some new perspective.

It‚Äôs important to know that K has bad mental health and gets depressive episodes. I have tried occasionally help him with said issues, but for the most part he just shuts out other people and tries to push his problems aside or let them be. That‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôs his own person and I can‚Äôt help him unless he wants, so I just let him be most of the time. The problem for me is that sometimes he uses it as an excuse for poor behavior, like in this instance.

I had come back to the dorm from a long day moving crap for my new apartment. I had been up from 5:30 on less than 5 hours of sleep, and had been moving heavy furniture, cleaning, and driving for over 14 hours that day, so I was out of it for the day. At one point I went to the shared sink in the dorm and found a fast food wrapper right in front of it. I figured it was K‚Äôs, because he tends to leave trash out at times, but usually keeps it isolated to his room. K was laying in his bed at the time, so I go and ask him if it was his. When he said yes, I asked him to clean up after himself, especially for the shared areas of the dorm.

K then says, ‚ÄúSorry my day has been really bad,‚Äù and proceeds to list off all of the issues he‚Äôs had with the day, including gf problems, best friend problems, car problems and family problems. I‚Äôll admit that it was a really shitty day from what he said. The thing is that the way he was talking was like he was talking down to me and make me feel bad for harassing him. It reminded of me of how my mom tries to guilt trip me and invalidate my concerns sheerly because my problems couldn‚Äôt possibly compare to his. It made me feel small and like I had done something wrong. After he finished, we just stood there in silence for a couple seconds before I ask him to just throw the trash away next time. I then threw the wrapper away for him and went back to my room to sleep.

The interaction was pretty mundane, but it keeps eating at me. On one hand, I‚Äôm frustrated and angry that K talked to me like that and I want to tell him that he can‚Äôt talk down on me because his day was bad. On the other, I feel guilty and like a bad friend, that I‚Äôm don‚Äôt have the right to say anything to him. AITA for making a problem out of nothing or do I need to talk with K?"
amitheasshole,AITA for talking to my girlfriend too much?,1,2025-04-27 23:04:38,17,"I(20M) have 4 roommates(3M 1MTF). We live in a house together and have very thin walls. Because of this, everyone hears everybody's business. My girlfriend and I have been dating for three and a half years and are currently long distance. We met well before I went to college and met my roommates. As you can imagine, since we don't see each other in person much, we call each other all the time. I try my very best to keep our conversations pg since I don't want to make anyone in the house uncomfortable. I tell her I love her and call her sweetheart and give her kisses over the phone and stuff like that all the time, all lovey dovey. I realize that this may be cringe to someone from the outside - such as my roomates - but I really do love her and I try not to let it bother me. To be cringe is to be free after all.

Secondly, I don't talk to my roommates much. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that I don't always have the energy to do so. I am very introverted, and most of them are extroverts. I also have ADHD and quite possibly some sort of autism, which means that whenever I'm not in person with someone, that person ceases to exist in my brain. I almost never text or call any of my friends for the same reason. We hang out every so often, but that's about the only time I talk to them. I also don't like drinking and while they have never tried to pressure me into doing anything I am uncomfortable with, they have called me a pussy for not wanting to get drunk on the weekend or going to a party at a strangers house. I feel like I've become the odd one out because of my unsocial tendencies.

Today, I was working on some homework, when I heard two of my roommates down the hall say to each other in a mocking voice ""goodbye sweetheart! I love you so! Mwah!"" Normally I would pass this off and say that they're just making a joke, but they said it in the EXACT way that I always say goodbye to my girlfriend. It's making me think they're making fun of me behind my back. It doesn't feel good when you think the people you live with are talking about you. Especially when you have a long history of friendships going sour from people thinking you're weird like I have. What do you make of this situation? Do you think I'm reading into this too much or are they most likely making fun of me?

In short, AITA for being cringe with my girlfriend all the time, while also barely speaking to my roommates?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not inviting my nephew to my sons birthday party?,6347,2025-04-25 23:59:54,647,"I (35f) have a son, Cillian (14m) who just recently had a birthday. The issue stems from his birthday from last year, where we invited all his cousins and his friends to celebrate him. The party went great for the first half, but when it came time to cut the cake I went over to fridge to go get it and saw it was half eaten. I was obviously upset about this because this had been a cake that I had made by a professional baker that cost me around $140 and my son really loved the design.

I asked who ate the cake and my sister (44f) laughed it off when her son, Robbie, (16m) told her that he ate the cake because he was hungry. To be clear the cake wasn‚Äôt the only food at the party, throughout the party we served many different dishes such as wings, veggie platters, pizzas, chips, and sodas. I was obviously angry that my son couldn‚Äôt have his cake and had to quickly go out and by one from Walmart. I‚Äôm honestly still shocked that with all the food at the party Robbie still managed to clear half of a huge cake, it was enough to produce about 20 slices.

I called my sister later to tell her I wasn‚Äôt happy with what her son had done and since I had spent so much money on the cake I expected it back. She then accused me of being fat phobic which absolutely is not true, I have never once discriminated against Robbie at any time, this was just a false accusation. To explain, Robbie has a weight problem and has been having issues with binging since he was around 13 which is why he is about 250 pounds and my sister has never failed to let anyone know of that and expects for everyone to bend over backwards for Robbie since he has it hard. 

This year Cillian wanted to have a friends only party with the exception of 2 cousins, one that only his friends and closest cousins could come to since he hated his party from last year. I asked why and he explained to me that he was embarrassed of Robbie since all he did was poke fun at his friends and him, bring his own uninvited plus one, and obviously he ate some of the cake. 

I complied and only invited his friends and allowed 2 of his cousins to join as well. Luckily some of my siblings were understanding, the only one who had an issue with this was my sister. She called me to ask why Robbie wasn‚Äôt invited and I explained to her that Cillian doesn‚Äôt want him there because of what he did last year, my sister was infuriated and said she knew we had an issue with her sons weight. Since then she has been ranting all over Facebook and I‚Äôve been getting calls from relatives and this entire situation has been stressing me out. AITA?"

My husband bought the stuff for him but I wasn‚Äôt happy and told him not to get any more expensive supplies since he can use cheaper brands and it can teach him the value of money.

amitheasshole,AITA for kicking my friend out of my house,79,2025-04-26 23:10:30,25,"Posting this anonymously because I don‚Äôt know if she has Reddit or not. On I phone so sorry for bad formatting 

Some background I (19) M moved my friend (19) F into my house last July. We have been friends for around 7 years now. She moved back to my state last may and I took her in a few months later. I was the one who paid to fly her home and had to convince my parents to let her move in with me because with my current working and schooling conditions I am unable to move out of my parents house.

To the story a couple of months ago we hit a rough patch in our friendship. I work 3 jobs and go to school full time trying to persue my dream career. But the problem arises that when I am home she is never around and almost never leaves her room while she is at my house ( she has a cat allergy and I have several cats but one of them is an outside cat and the house has several air purifiers running at all times including in her room) my mom will leave a chore list and although I get up usually several hours later than her nothing will be done. As well as her having a boyfriend who I despise. He has drinking and got convicted of a dui right when they began dating and she didn‚Äôt listen to me when I told her he is bad news. All of this came to a head around 2 weeks ago we were coming back from an event at one of my jobs and she was telling me everything I was doing wrong in our friendship how I‚Äôm not communicating with her anymore and she feels like she never sees me. That is when I will admit I kind of lost it and told her that anytime I am around she is always with her boyfriend and that I don‚Äôt feel like she has respected me since she moved in with me. Mind you I‚Äôve paid for food clothes plane ticket home and many more things since she came home. While she does work all of her money is spent when she goes out with her boyfriend. And for those who will ask she does pay rent but only $25 a month whereas I pay $300. Other people in my life have told me that she is just taking me for a ride and I am a ‚Äúfriend of convenience‚Äù for her 

So Reddit AITA

Any additional information wanted I will give on some conditions"
amitheasshole,AITA for ditching lunch with friends because of one them brought a dog?,2707,2025-04-26 02:27:00,350,"
So some people in my friend group and I met up at a restaurant for lunch the other day.  It was a newer place and looked kinda interesting so we wanted to try it out.  One friend was a bit late and ended up arriving last, and she had her dog with her.  For some background, I have trauma related to dogs and being bitten as a kid, and to this day I get very very anxious and scared around dogs, even smaller ones.  I told my friend this when I found out she was a dog person and owned two, and we've always organized things so that I pretty much wouldn't be around them.  I've always appreciated her respecting my boundaries and making an effort to make me comfortable.  

But yeah that day she came to lunch with a very large dog (can't give details on what breed, I barely know anything about that stuff sorry) and as soon as I saw it I felt so uneasy.  We had a table outside the restaurant, so the dog would be next to us the whole time we ate, and that thought really made me panic.  Another friend noticed I was very on edge and asked if I was fine.  I told him I was sorry and I had to leave, he made the connection with the dog and said it was totally fine and he understood.  I told everyone bye and left (I hadn't ordered yet).  Everyone seemed chill about me leaving, but later on I got a text from my friend, the dog owner, telling me she felt really disappointed that I'd ditched them just because she'd brought her dog.  She said I overreacted, that she understands I get stressed but that the dog is well trained and well mannered, and I wouldn't have even noticed it being there after a while.  She said that overall my reaction seemed over the top and disrespectful.  Now I'm not sure, like of course I don't blame her for bringing her dog, that's a me problem, she shouldn't always have to accomodate me.  Maybe I should've tried to tolerate it and tried to forget it was there?  I don't know, I thought me leaving was fine but I'm worried I might've actually offended her in some way.  Am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not attending my brother's 18th birthday party?,6,2025-04-27 12:21:12,16,"I (20F) have a brother (17M), who will turn 18 in a few months. I'll be there on his actual birthday, but the family has planned to go to a fancy restaurant on the following Saturday to celebrate properly. This is where the issues start.

For the entire weekend (including the birthday dinner), I'll be at the DoKomi. The DoKomi is the biggest cosplay convention in Europe. I've paid for everything already and when I bought tickets etc. I talked to my family about it, because there had been a similiar issue in the past year. Back then, everyone seemed on board with the idea and approved of me buying tickets and booking hotels.

The DoKomi is very important to me. I'm studying law and working a mini job, so I'm always busy and stressed out. Cosplaying (which I all pay for by myself) balances this stress and keeps my mental health, self esteem and social life in check. Since the DoKomi is THE biggest convention, it's the most important date of the year to me.

Anyways, my brother got furious when I told him I couldn't come to the birthday dinner. He said that since I went to so many conventions anyways, I should just cancel this one. He accused me of not caring about him at all and being extremly selffish. Because the 18th is his special day, he's pretty upset about me not showing up for the dinner.

While I get where he's coming from, it's unfair that I have to cancel an event I planned one year ago just because my family made dinner reservation two weeks ago. Also, I'm not sure if I could describe the relationship between me and my brother as ""good"". Since he's the only brother I ever had, I don't know how much arguments and disagreements is the normal amount, but he is one of the reason I desperately want to move out

My family is considering to reschedule the dinner, but I can tell they're pissed. Especially because the birthday dinner is also meant to celebrate my parent's birthday, who have their birthdays a week prior to my brother. Though the main focus is still the 18th Birthday.

When I confronted my parents about specifically telling them about my plans and them approving on year ago, suddenly they have forgotten everything and are accussing me of lying. Wow, how very cool of you. Reddit, am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA For telling my girlfriend to give up on contacting her cousin?,107,2025-04-26 18:47:45,28,"My girlfriend (GF) and I have been dating for almost a year. We‚Äôre long distance (1.5‚Äì2 hours apart), so I‚Äôve only met her mom and stepdad so far. She lives with her dad, but we haven‚Äôt met him yet because of conflicting schedules.

One person she talks about constantly is her little cousin, who she calls her ‚Äúlittle broke bestie.‚Äù They‚Äôre 12 years apart, similar to my relationship with my much younger sister, so I get it. My GF has always spoiled her cousin ‚Äî trips, spas, mani/pedis ‚Äî without expecting anything in return.

The issue: her cousin constantly bails on her, often at the last minute. Last year, they planned a fancy getaway, and after my GF booked a nice hotel and pulled strings for an upgrade, the cousin canceled the night before. Later, she complained she ""would‚Äôve come if she knew it was going to be a nice stay.""

The cousin is now dating a guy who‚Äôs in and out of jail. When she‚Äôs with him, she ghosts my GF. Only when she‚Äôs single does she reach out ‚Äî usually to vent about her relationship drama. My GF gets hurt every time.

I told her to stop reaching out to her cousin ‚Äî it's a one-sided relationship. I even (maybe harshly) predicted the cousin would get pregnant and learn the hard way. Sure enough, the cousin announced her pregnancy (on April Fool‚Äôs Day) and even left my GF on read after she congratulated her.

Now, the cousin only contacts her when she needs something. I told my GF I have zero respect for someone who treats family like that, and I don't want anything to do with her cousin ‚Äî including attending the baby shower.

My GF thanked me for being in her corner but is still really sad about the situation, especially because she‚Äôs an only child and considered her cousin like a little sister.

So, AITA for asking my GF to stop contacting someone who clearly doesn't value her?

Edit: Should've been more clear: I was trying to ask if I'm the asshole for even bringing up the non-contact. I told her she should stop contact, but at the end of the day it's her decision. "
amitheasshole,AITA For leaving family holiday early,0,2025-04-27 19:47:14,15,"So I‚Äôm currently overseas for the first time ever with family. That includes me 19m and my dad and some of his brothers and his parents all like aged 50+ leaving my brother 17m and my two little cousins 12m and 7f the only other people so there is 11 in total.

I am currently hating life in Italy rn as I do not get a long with any of the family and me and my dad are completely different with me being like my mum and he hates me for it. So I get a long with no one 

And I have learnt that we apparently have different understanding to what a holiday is for me it‚Äôs relaxing partying drinking smoking u know average 19 year old and I was expecting to have free roam this trip. Little did I know that not only do I not get to free roam but we are going on tour guides about every day and we are exploring the whole country and I understand it for the older people but if they had told me before the holiday that‚Äôs what we are doing I would have never showed up. 

I was never told what the holiday was going to be like and now I‚Äôm trapped in Italy for 4 weeks really tempted to just bite the bullet and pay the 1k for a ticket back I just wish they communicated and told me what the holiday was actually gonna be like I feel trapped as the only person my age in the group it‚Äôs mentally draining me to spend 12+ hours a day with them without freedom 

So would I be the ass for telling my dad I bought a ticket and going back home

So I find it seriously rude that I told him a few hours before our call that I don't appreciate being in the middle of a conversation with him and he tells me that his friend is calling him and that he needs to go... I was in need of comfort and reassurance coz of a topic we were talking about I was asking him for help and that's when she called him. He then tells me that she's all alone for the night and that he has to go, so out of frustration I told him through messages that he must go and entertain her, he responded by say wow ok and that's when the conversation ended.
The next day he acts like everything is alright I barely messaged him eventually at the end of the day he asked me what was wrong  

*so I said this 
(I'm still seriously pissed off with you coz of what you did yesterday to me)

*He responded with 
(Ohhhh well, to be honest with you... I'm not happy with you about the way you reacted... I don't appreciate jealousy... you want boundaries from me, well I want that to...
I love you boo... completely with all my heart... and I am not going stop talking to the people who I love and who matter to me in my life... but I really don't appreciate that reaction... 
I'm not apologizing for yesterday, because I didn't do anything wrong to you... you're welcome to express why you feel what I did wrong... and I will apologize for what I agree with... but your reaction was wrong in my opinion...)

*I then responded with 
Ok 
And he said goodnight I just ignored the message.
If there's any questions please ask away.
So AITA or is he?"
amitheasshole,AITA Declining an Invitation After Finding Out the Cost,777,2025-04-26 06:58:49,74,"Hello fellow Redditors! This is a quick story to gauge my wife and I‚Äôs reaction to something that happened recently.

Backstory: My relationship with my father is complicated. Specifically, he gets really excited about something that he wants to do, and then guilts those around him into doing the same thing. My wife has set firm boundaries with him, which he hates.

Example: A couple Christmases ago he bought her a commissioned artwork after repeated warnings not to get her anything that would make clutter. My wife told him she wanted a gift card or a vacuum cleaner (which we needed for a while). Nope. He fucks off and gets her a random piece of art and didn‚Äôt understand why she didn‚Äôt want it.

Current Situation: My birthday is on Monday. My dad texts me today saying he has tickets to a family reunion at a ball game and that my wife and I are invited because a couple other people cancelled. I say yes. A few exchanged texts later, he tells me that the tickets are $40 a piece, and to Venmo him. I explained that we don‚Äôt expect him to pay for everything, but that‚Äôs a lot of money for our current forms of employment. I also said that Baseball has never been my thing, and I don‚Äôt want to spend a day off driving two hours to (and from) the stadium. I hate feeling like a petulant child, but he should definitely know it‚Äôs not my (or my wife‚Äôs) thing.

My father invited my wife and I to a baseball game. Only afterwards did he request payment for the tickets. AITA for telling him we‚Äôd rather just stay home and not pay $80?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who commented on this post, I appreciate the honest feedback! I didn‚Äôt post for absolution of affirmation. I wanted to see if my view of reality wasn‚Äôt some weird fantasy. I‚Äôd love to set firm boundaries, but my dad is about five inches taller than I am and was a semi-professional athlete. So, he‚Äôs much larger than I am and doesn‚Äôt understand how his size intimidates people. Plus, he loves to apologize by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way.‚Äù He has the emotional intelligence of a gnat."
amitheasshole,AITA for snapping at my prom dates friends for third wheeling?,1,2025-04-27 18:25:58,9,"AITA? To start off I‚Äôm just completely confused on how I should be feel ing right now. I will say my dates friend whom I will mention soon isn‚Äôt my friend, it‚Äôs just a connection I had and she‚Äôs rather annoying if I‚Äôm being honest. I (17m) went with this girl (18f) (who I met through a connection) to prom. Yesterday was the big day and I was pretty excited because I was chosen by her friend to take her since I was genuinely interested instead of the other option they gave her. It started off pretty good I thought. We all took our pictures and a lot were of just her and I and then some group ones with the other friends. After we finished we headed to the restaurant and that‚Äôs sort of when the third wheelers joined in. Her friend sat in the same booth as us so it made it somewhat hard/awkward talking to my date seeing how they were talking to eachother a lot. It was whatever since we did talk as a group quite a bit so I let it go. After we finish eating we then headed to the place where prom was being held. I thought it was going to be really nice with me and my date (I‚Äôll call her Emma) (her friend I‚Äôll call Lexi) walking down the red carpet as it would be our first time and quite the experience, well I guess not because her friend Lexi somehow butted in and walked beside us so I felt it wasn‚Äôt as special. Ok, fine I thought. That‚Äôs slightly annoying but I shrugged it off. Things took a big turn when we got inside. More of Emma‚Äôs and Lexi‚Äôs friends were there and they joined in (about 3-4 more). I tried to dance with Emma but I just couldn‚Äôt make it near her somehow. Her friends just made it completely impossible to do so. At this point I‚Äôm really irritated but I‚Äôm trying to have fun. So I go off with my friends for a bit and then the plan was to go back when a slow song comes on so I can dance with her. Well that song comes on and she‚Äôs absolutely nowhere in sight, the song ends, and that‚Äôs the last one to come on for the night. Well, I wanted one thing that night and it was to bond with Emma and have one or a few slow dances with her. I couldn‚Äôt even get that so now I‚Äôm completely pissed at Lexi and her friends that joined but I also feel like I was the shittiest prom date for not trying harder to push away her friends and get to dance so you can tell I‚Äôm lost in how to feel right now so AITA for being mad and not trying harder or is it not my fault for how they acted?

Edit- this was my prom and I invited her"
amitheasshole,AITA for not driving my gf to brunch?,68,2025-04-26 19:32:09,76,"Hello, 

Just curious if a fucked up here or not. Some background: my (24m) and gf (23f) had plans to go golfing with some friends of ours in the afternoon and she had plans to go get brunch with a friend a few hours before. She wanted me to drive her to brunch, then back to her place, then to golf. But when they had planned on going to brunch they would‚Äôve only had 1 hour to eat there before the place closed. I had originally agreed to drive her because I thought it would be at least a couple hours they‚Äôd spend chit chatting and what not. But since she told me that it was only gonna be an hour I suggested that she just drive herself because otherwise I‚Äôd be driving from my place to her place and pick her up, drive her to brunch, kill an hours worth of time somehow or drive back home and wait to pick her up, then drive back to the brunch place and pick her up, and she wanted to run back to her place before golf so I woulda drove us back to her place, then drive to and from golf. I just suggested she drive herself to brunch because otherwise it was a lot of driving for myself whereas now she would just drive to and from brunch, then I would pick her up and take her to golf. She got mad because I had originally agreed but I just said it made more sense if she drove herself to brunch because otherwise I‚Äôm just driving around. Just seemed like the most logical thing at the time. So I‚Äôm just wondering, did I fuck up here? I honestly thought it was the most logical way to do things otherwise I was just driving for about 3 hours straight. Thanks "
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my mother to communicate with her ex?,2,2025-04-27 18:09:24,11,"10 years ago, my mother started dating a man my age (19) who I went to high school and was actually friends with, and they have since been married, divorced, gotten back together, and now broken up again. 7 or so years ago, they bought car together with her as the primary owner even though the car was for him (she had her own). They started letting me use this car when I totalled mine a few months ago because he's a truck driver and lives in his truck when he's working and my mom prefers to drive them even when he's not working. 

Well as I said, they've broken up again. She ghosted him a couple weeks ago with no warning to him, didn't let him pack things, just stopped answering calls and started acting like he's an ass for continuing to call. He contacted me because when she ghosted him, the car was having issues and he was checking if the parts that needed replaced were under warranty, and he ended up saying he'd sign his name off the title and be done with it if that's really what she wants. When I spoke to her, she was happy with this, said they'd sign the car over to me because she doesn't want it. Except she's still refusing to speak to him. He called me yesterday to follow up about the car issues, which I've gotten mostly fixed. It needs some pricey repairs that aren't urgent so I haven't dealt with yet because frankly I don't want to dump that kind of money into someone else's car. My mom told me to go ahead and do it because the car is basically mine, but I feel like its not very ""mine"" when I cant insure it and wont be able to renew the registration thats coming up. Anyways during the phone call yesterday, he asked about a trailer he bought for her and said he wants to buy it from her. I relayed the message and she proceeded to make a lengthy facebook post about how he needs to stop calling her, he's not getting her trailer, and to leave her family alone. 

As an added bonus, I'm trying to move out of state currently because my husband is 3 states away for work and we've been working on moving me there for months now, but I'm horribly uncomfortable with taking someone else's car out of state, especially being unable to change the registration or insure it properly and in the correct state. 

AITA for asking her to speak to him long enough to get the paper signed? I really don't care if she wants to sell him the trailer or not, I think its crappy she won't let him gather his things but I'm not even asking for that, just one signature. I'm already looking at buying a new car so I can get out of this situation entirely, but I need to know if I'm unreasonable for asking this of her. "
amitheasshole,AITA for talking bad about my brother to my mom for his opinion on a video game character?,0,2025-04-27 23:27:07,39,"I (m16) and my brother (m14) had a disagreeement about a popular video game recently, and when I spoke to my mom about it, she thought I was overreacting.

So I‚Äôve been into a popular game recently, and my brother wanted to get into it as well. I won‚Äôt say the name specifically, but I‚Äôm sure fans of the game will recognise it based on my descriptions.

The game features a villain character who does some truly heinous things, including getting a woman pregnant and then forcing her to get rid of the baby (I can‚Äôt say fully what he did to this woman, but just know it‚Äôs disgusting). My brother came up to me recently and said that he believed the character wasn‚Äôt all bad, and that he was trying to be better. I told him that just because the character voices his trying to ‚Äòfix‚Äô things and does things that seem to make him a better person doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs better, not to mention he doesn‚Äôt actually apologise to the female character or try to make it better with her. My brother got upset at this and said ‚Äòhe tried to be better‚Äô, and I then got upset at him for his siding with this character. I know it‚Äôs just a game, but I‚Äôve met people who have dealt with similar things, and I myself have too (not on nearly as strong a scale, but enough that it‚Äôs become a bit of a problem that comes up in therapy), and I know many people like that in real life will never genuinely try to be better, which I feel the character represented. He got upset at me and stormed off.

Later I tried to speak to our mom about it, and the second I started saying my brother was upset with me, she looked annoyed. When I explained what happened, she got upset and told me it‚Äôs just a game and that I shouldn‚Äôt take it so personally. I tried to explain to my mom what the character did in the game (more so than I did here) and she kind of just brushed me off and told me to take a nap. Based on her response, I think I might be overreacting, but I just feel strongly about this kind of topic. AITA?

Edit: Just to clarify, the character he believes to be a redeemable character is Jimmy from the game Mouthwashing"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my mum I don't like her telling her friends about internal family issues?,98,2025-04-26 16:23:27,58,"I (14M) live with my mum and often struggle with certain things, in this case, eating. She knows this and often tells me I need to eat more, no problem with that. However, recently she has been talking to her friends more often and if I'm in the room, or her conversation gets silent, she likes to tell them how ""skinny"" I am. Also, I think it is important to mention that I am a picky eater. I am not a big guy (5'2 at 47kg) but recently she seems to use it as a joke to get a laugh out of her friends. 

This happened today when she was talking to one of her friends from church. She was asking if I wanted mushrooms and I said no, leading to her bringing it up. This upset me but I tried to just ignore it. However, when we got in the car after eating she was certain on finding out what was bothering me. I told her that I didn't like her calling me the ""skinniest"" and ""bony"" child to all of her friends as when I see them, it now gives me a bad impression. 

She immediatley freaked out and said I have no respect for her and I shouldn't be telling her who to speak to. I tried to apologize but she shut me down and started complaining about how I don't ever listen and she can tell her friends what she wants. 

I don't know what to do as I think I am pretty healthy and no one but her seems to have a problem with my build."
amitheasshole,AITA for not going to my family‚Äôs cottage,66,2025-04-26 18:24:15,38,"this started all last year but i feel like this decision is going to bring on some family drama again so i need impartial opinions

last year, my (20f) family bought a cottage for the whole family to use. my parents weren‚Äôt involved in the purchase of the cottage at all but we were apparently invited to use it as long as it‚Äôs available. 

one day i was with my cousin getting ready to go out and her mom (my aunt, 40s) asked to talk to me. she told me they had bought a cottage and was showing me photos of it. i told her i was happy and excited for her because the whole family had been talking about getting a cottage and we all enjoy spending time together as a family. she then told me i wasn‚Äôt included because my dad (her brother) wasn‚Äôt involved in buying the cottage. i was slightly taken aback but told her it was okay and asked to hear more about the cottage. she told me about the maintenance and explained when it would open for the season etc etc and then she left to do her own thing. as my cousin and i were leaving to go out, she stops me in the kitchen and says ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not invited to the course don‚Äôt get upset‚Äù. i laughed it off and told her not to worry as i had plans for the summer anyways and left. 

after reflecting on the interaction and conversation, i told my mom i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable or welcome going to the cottage and i feel like my dad should speak to his sister as the whole situation was incredibly rude and uncalled for. my dad refuses (to this day) to talk to my aunt and ask for an apology because ‚Äúi handled it well‚Äù and she would never apologize. after that, i decided i wouldn‚Äôt go to the cottage, even if i was invited, until she apologized to me for what she said. my cousins have been trying to persuade me to go as we haven‚Äôt had a cousins cottage trip in a while but i genuinely don‚Äôt feel like i should be there. 

anyways, they opened the cottage for the season and everyone is asking about availability and making plans to go up there for a weekend. i haven‚Äôt said anything because i don‚Äôt want to create more drama for the family but my dad is making me feel bad for the fact that i don‚Äôt want to go. so would i be an asshole if i didn‚Äôt go? i already made it clear i want an apology and acknowledgment from my aunt that what she said was rude and unnecessary but everyone is making me feel weird for dying in this hill because ‚Äúfamily shouldnt fight‚Äù. 


edit: to clear things up, all my aunts were involved in the purchasing of the cottage. based on previous conversations with my family, everyone was invited to use the cottage as long as there was availability / they were family. im not sure why my parents werent involved in buying the cottage and ive honestly never questioned it. my aunts (not including the one who i‚Äôm kinda upset with) know about the situation and have told me / my parents that my other aunt just says things and to ignore her and of course we can use the cottage if we want and come if were invited"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I asked my mom to stop parking in the parent and child parking spaces everytime she goes shopping with me?,313,2025-04-26 09:43:11,158,"So my mom usually takes me (18M) grocery shopping and parks in the parent and child spaces, she does this even if we‚Äôre going somewhere else such as malls, hospitals, and other, she doesn‚Äôt always do this, but does this very often, We would often get nasty looks from mothers with young children in the parking lot everytime we would get out of our car or load our groceries in, since I hate being stared at I asked my mom if it‚Äôs even okay to park in those spaces despite me being an adult and my mom just said ‚ÄúI can park here because you are my child‚Äù (note: I am her youngest kid, but i have two siblings aged 2 and 4 that my dad got from a different marriage that visit on winter break), my mom sold her car and got a new one and still continues to park in those spaces everytime she goes grocery shopping with me, we still get those dirty looks from families and it gets me tense, knowing that one of them wants to scream at us, we recieved an agressive note saying ‚Äúif you do not have kids, do not park here‚Äù which my mom just ripped up and ignored, I wanna ask my mom again because I‚Äôm scared of what will happen to us, but I‚Äôm scared that she will get angry or worse

WIBTA?

UPDATE/EDIT: she has been fined ¬£70 for parking in the space and I decided to have a talk with her and was able to do it without causing an argument, I explained to her that I am able to get out of the car just fine and that while I can‚Äôt stand for long periods of time, I can get in and out of the car just fine, I also told her that I aknowledge that I am her child, but there is likely a mother or father who would need to get a buggy or child out of the car but also worry about the child getting hurt or scratching up the other car, she just went ‚Äúok then‚Äù the only issue is that I don‚Äôt know if she will stick to her promise as grocery shopping is gonna be done next week"
