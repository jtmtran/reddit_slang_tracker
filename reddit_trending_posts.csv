GenZ,Reminder that the science proves that racist people are insecure,79,2025-04-03 20:43:40,70,"TLDR: The science (identity psychology + brain/hormone scans) proves that racist behavior is a defense mechanism for insecurity. Racism is just ""out-group derogation"", an instinctual tribalistic reaction to feeling threatened by another group. And yes this applies to and from all races.

With the recent rise of racism, if this fact became common knowledge I believe it would significantly decrease racist behavior. As being racist would be seen as embarrassing. As a ""self-own."" A lot of people intuitively suspect this already, but it's nice to have scientific confirmation.

First, a short intro to identity psychology:

In-Groups = Groups you identify with.

Out-Groups = Groups you don't identify with.

What we think of as racism is just ""out-group derogation""
Out-group derogation is a well documented behavior in humans. Essentially it is the act of putting down out-groups. Unfortunately all the evidence points to the fact that it is an instinctual thing. Not saying that racism is a part of human nature, but tribalism most certainly is.

But why do people feel the need to do this in the first place? What drives people to go out of their way to spread hatred against out-groups? The behavioral sciences hold the answer.

Racism, sexism, nationalism, religious conflict, etc, all revolve around out-group derogation. The cause of out-group derogation is distress, and the effect is a temporary relief/boost in self esteem for the person engaging in it.

If a person feels the need to be racist to X ""race"", it is more likely than not that they perceive X race as somehow being a threat to the power/influence/status of that person's race. Being racist, spreading racist propaganda/misinformation, even just casual racism, are all psychological defense mechanisms for this insecurity.

GenZ,The Democratic Party needs to bring in the best they have to offer next election.,45,2025-04-03 23:39:33,74,"/title  

With the news of the tariffs that will likely be the final push into a full on recession, I feel like it‚Äôs time I finally break my own political silence. When I was younger I generally viewed myself as a right leaning individual, but since about 2018 that‚Äôs been slowly dwindling away as I‚Äôve watched the Republican Party become the worst iteration of itself(looking back it was never as great as I once thought). I took an apolitical approach until this past election, when I finally began seeing myself as left leaning with some few right wing views. I and many of you reading this are watching the last of what was once the American dream be yanked from under us by a bunch of old fools who are at a point where they have nothing to lose. With that said, they only won because of the people who didn‚Äôt vote, rather than who did. This is were the democrats have to focus their efforts, because after this term, I am willing to bet that a lot of non voters will be willing to vote in the next election. Right now is a time to fight like hell against the tide, and for the Democratic Party to begin bringing in fresh blood that isn‚Äôt pushing senile. The biggest focus they need to have is restoring economic stability, healthy diplomatic relations with our now strained allies, and instilling hope within working class Americans. We have a dark 4 years ahead, but when the time comes, both the political and citizen sides will have to pull their weight. Until then we mustn‚Äôt let the current administration turn us on each other while they watch from afar."

Hyper independence? 
Over Self sacrificing yourself to the point where others just use you? 
Not doing anything that you find enjoyable that‚Äôs socially looked as too childish? 
Keeping all your personal problems to yourself to an extremely unhealthy degree and never sharing them with your friends? 


Or being self aware and owning your shit in what you want to do in your personal life? 

Like be fr what do you want us to do? 

Besides I‚Äôve already ‚Äògrown up‚Äô enough to realise what I want in life and don‚Äôt need anyone to tell me I need to grow up. I can make my own decisions and do what I what I want from now on that‚Äôs the only positive thing about adulthood. I started giving less fucks to begin with and I‚Äôm sure most of us have.

GenZ,Is anyone else kinda over the Democratic Party?,579,2025-04-03 00:22:12,606,"Chuck Schumer talking about Trump‚Äôs approval ratings going down was a moment of clarity for me. These people would let Trump loose on the world if it meant they could go back to power in 2026 and 2028, while doing absolutely nothing to mitigate the damage.

I hope this ages like milk, but unless people like AOC and Bernie and Booker become the leader, I don‚Äôt really see myself turning out for these people.

Edit:

So this is what it feels like. As long as Trump is president any criticism of the Dems is labeled bait or stupidity or generational apathy or ‚Äúthe problem‚Äù. I feel more and more confident that supporting the Dems as they are now will not make this country better. These people, including those in this comment section, are not interested in finding better ways to make America better.

GenZ,It really is because of that damn phone,11,2025-04-03 13:37:21,18,"I don't care how much I sound like a Gen X mom in this post. It IS that damn phone.

Modern teenagers spend [more than 7 hours a day](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/screen-time-for-teens) on screens. If you do the math, you'll find that [the average 18 year old will spend 93% of the free time in their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TMPXK9tw5U) in front of a screen. Of course, pretty much no one *wants* to spend 93% of their free time on a screen, but these things are designed to be addictive. Social media companies have teams of the smartest neuroscientists in the world dedicated to keeping you addicted to YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, and whatever else you like to include. Since our lawmakers are too incompetent to protect their citizens from these things, it's up to you to snatch back control over your time.

The effects from spending hours a day on your phone are strong and well documented. Studies have consistently shown for years that high screen time is [strongly correlated with increased anxiety, depression, loneliness, and all sorts of other issues](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353947/). It's appalling that social media platforms can be used by *children* (or anyone else, honestly) when the implications of these platforms are known to be horrible. Social media for minors is completely unjust - it's setting up a fight between the willpower of a 15 year old, and a supercomputer designed by the smartest people on earth to keep you addicted. Who is going to win that fight? On average, for seven hours a day, the supercomputer wins.

Social media is also known for sending people down political pipelines that dump people on the extremes of both sides, and polarization is now higher than its been in decades, which makes sense when you consider your feed is specifically tailored to you. Remember the killing of the health insurance company leader, and how pretty much everyone online seemed to support it? Turns out, only [17% of Americans view that event favorably](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/17/united-healthcare-ceo-killing-poll). Extrapolate this example to other political issues and you get an idea of why we're so divided and why we're so shocked when our candidates don't win or our ideas prevail in the real world.

There's a reason why [more successful people spend less time on a screen](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-infographic-8-18-census-web-final-release_0.pdf) \- high income earners are consistently the least affected by phones and social media. I've met only one person under 18 who has their own business, and I've also only met one person under 18 who chooses to use a burner phone instead of a smartphone. Guess what? They're the same person. Coincidence? I think NOT!

Also, I need to rant about how much people my age use their phones in public. It's genuinely sad. I take a couple classes for dual enrollment credit at a local technical college, and no one even talks to each other. Everyone's just on their phones all. The. Time. In my English class (which may have problems, but is still very fun and interesting considering it's English), half the class is openly on their phones for the entire lecture.

I've tried to talk to my classmates, but usually whenever I do, they give a one sentence response and then go back to scrolling on their phone. Like, really? This is the loneliest generation ever, so you'd think that people would welcome friendly interaction, especially since *I'm* doing the hardest move of starting the conversation, but nope. If I'm missing some key detail in these situations, feel free to tell me in the comments because I have no idea (and no, I am not ugly or dressed weird, you can rule that reason out).

""Well maybe they just don't want to talk"" Sure, people don't have to talk to me, that's fine. But then I should see this trend with older adults, and I haven't seen that. I've yet to be in a place where people over 35 behave this way.

Just please, for the love of God, put your phone away in public unless you're actively making plans or doing something important. Even if you don't talk to anyone, and even if you just sit there, it's still so much better than being in front of a screen. Try it, at least once. Start a conversation with the old man in front of you on the train. Read a book if you're bored in class. Study the bulletin for nearby events while standing in line for coffee. You'll rediscover the world beyond your screen.

""But what if I have social anxiety?"" Research suggests your phone is to blame for social anxiety in the first place. I'm not here to tell you exactly what will work for curing your social anxiety, but you know what *won't* work? Scrolling on your phone to avoid making eye contact with the person in front of you. Seriously, do *anything* else. I'd recommend a book if you still want to avoid interaction, and [reading books has a long list of benefits](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/health-benefits-of-reading).

""But I don't have energy for anything besides using my phone when I get home from school/work!"" You don't even need to have energy to do better things than scrolling TikTok. Literally sitting still and staring at a wall would be better for you than TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shorts, or whatever you scroll on. At least a wall won't feed you misinformation. With any luck, you'll get bored of staring at the wall and be forced to do something interesting like go outside.

""You have almost 100K Reddit karma, aren't you kind of a hypocrite?"" Yes, I am. We all are. I used to waste a pathetic amount of time on this platform, and even though I cut my time down considerably, I still have a big problem with screen time. I'm as much a victim of these tech companies as you are. I just hope to shed some light on what your phone and computer are doing to you.

If just one person quits Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, or just stops using their phone because of this post, I have done my job well. And if you want to be that one person, go, do it. Stop reading and start doing.

TLDR: Sorry, but that's not available here. If it would kill you to read the post, then you need to read it more than anyone else.

GenZ,What's going on with Millennials hate towards Gen Z...?,0,2025-04-04 01:11:15,5,"I'm of the oldest Gen Z, and some of the things I'm witnessing are just kinda weird. Like it's probably just a very online discussion, I have Millennial friends irl and they're pretty chill and they're great friends with good advice, but the others I've seen in online spaces are just turning into the former generations with the hating on the kids thing. 
They constantly call out that Gen Z is more conservative, while I guess forgetting that we saw them all being superrrr misogynistic and homophobic and everything else, just while partying and wearing scene clothes I guess...?
I know they're not old enough for dementia yet... 
Not to mention, I think the ""I'm a 38 year old teenager"" jokes have really just rotted a few brains. In comment sections like ""Gen Z making fun of cringe is why no one wants to be themselves anymore"". 
Again, you're like 38, why do you care what a teenager thinks about anything you're doing...? I'm mid 20s currently, and when a kid thinks I'm cringe or getting old it is laughably easy to let it go. What power does a child truly have to influence anything in my adult life? It just feels like a remix of blaming Millennials for everything, now they're getting older and it's fun to take a moral high ground and blame the youth again, like a ""well it happened to me soooo plus I have a 'valid reason' this time"", while conveniently forgetting how bad the 2000s actually was, and how we all saw them basically being performative, dressing scene but turning around and calling someone a f*g, Taylor Swift white feminism rampant, transphobia and they literally still cannot let Harry Potter go even though the actors themselves have denounced it, but gen z is supposedly more conservative.
Seems to me both generations have the exact same issues going on, it's just the younger one is louder and more upfront than the other about their true ideals. :/"

Fuck your wet lady fingers, fuck all half a dozen eggs you decided waste in this economy, fuck your expensive mascarpone, throw it all in the trash because egg whites and cream that whip perfectly fine separately don‚Äôt whip if you mix them together.

GenZ,Does Gen Z use Instagram‚Äîor is it kind of dead?,3,2025-04-03 12:21:26,61,"I‚Äôm trying to figure out where Gen Z is really *hanging out* online. I recently started a finance-focused content account aimed at Gen Z, and I‚Äôve seen a bit of traction on TikTok and YouTube Shorts‚Äînothing viral, but I‚Äôve picked up just over 100 followers on each platform. More importantly, I‚Äôve had solid engagement: comments, DMs, reposts, people saying it‚Äôs helping them, etc.

But Instagram? Absolute *crickets*. Same content, same tone, but barely any views or interaction. It honestly feels like I‚Äôm posting into the void.

So I‚Äôm wondering:

* Are Gen Z just not on IG for this kind of content?
* Or is my stuff just not suited for the IG vibe?
* If you *are* on IG, what kind of content do you actually follow there (if any)?

Curious what others here think. Is it worth pushing IG, or is it mostly a ghost town for creators trying to reach Zoomers?"

GenZ,The only thing that gets me down about dating in 2025. And what I do to cheer myself up.,0,2025-04-03 18:10:31,5,"I stay a remarkably positive and happy person about pretty much everything. But I know I definitely have to stay extra positive and optimistic with dating in today's world.

With that said the only thing that has a tendency to get me down when it comes to dating is when I compare myself to others. I know I might not have as many things or be as conventional as a great deal of guys out there. And that is totally fine. I do not need to compare myself to them.

The problem is when I go online and see so many other men (and women) struggling to get into a relationship, I have a tendency to think well, they all offer so many things that I do not offer. I start to worry that I have no chance, if these guys with so much more to offer than me are also struggling.

What I have to remind myself is I am not in a competition with them. I am not chasing the same person they are chasing. I am chasing a very specific and special type of person. I am not in competition with anyone else in the world for this person.

Because I know who I am. I know what I offer. I know what I am looking for. No one else has my fun, no one else has my intellect, no one else can offer exactly what I offer :)

I am one of a kind. There is no point in comparing myself to others because I offer something nobody else does. 

Deep down I think everyone should think exactly like this :) I hope as many people do as possible.

Thank you so much:)"

GenZ,Gen z narrative,4,2025-04-03 06:42:45,12,"Every week there is an article about something wrong with us, we're lazy, we lack many skills, etc... I wanna know what survey  did the do to support these claims. They act as if our generation is so different and so bad. A couple of example:

- Gen x family member complained that I didnt want to have kids because I don't think I'm capable of properly raising a child. I also wanna do what I want in life. They said I'm selfish and I'm going to die unhappy. Wouldn't it be better to not have a child and just begrudgingly raise it.

- Same family member said she read that all these plane crashes is because gen z has enter the workforce and we do a half as job of regulating these planes.

- Boomer said most people in my generation can't write in cursive or read an analog clock because we like to do things the easy way. I personally can do both because my mom taught me. 

- See an article saying we don't want to work in the office because we cant binge watch our favorite shows. 

I'm an adult esl teacher. I teach people who are older then me. Sometime they swear I don't know what I'm talking about, they don't listen because Im too young in their eyes, fail and blame me for them not listening. However, the folks that do listen and ask questions don't fail. They actually do stellar ( which is the majority). Rarely am I doubted and I think I've solidified how good a teacher at this point the few students just swallow their pride and listen. Now they're doing well)

I don't think everyone in our generation is great, but are we really that different. I'm sure everyone has an uncle, aunt, great aunt, etc.. that are lazy, unskilled and lackadaisical. Thoughts?

A: It‚Äôs ridiculous that Trump is threatening Denmark over Greenland!

B: I disagree with the way he‚Äôs doing it. But Europeans rely too much on US spending, and Trump has a strong negotiating position

A: Are you seriously defending the guy who‚Äôs tanking the stock market? This won‚Äôt lower egg prices!

Do you see what Mr. A did wrong? Let‚Äôs look at another example:

A: Cutting the Dept. of Education is a great idea. It‚Äôs wasteful spending!

B: Can you trust states to handle education on their own? Should there be some oversight?

A: Democrats literally hate young men so I don‚Äôt care what happens. They‚Äôd rather push gender ideology.

Do you see how in both examples, Mr. A does nothing to address the issue at hand or engage with Mr. B? Mr. A just throws out an unrelated statement that he thinks will ‚Äúown the other side.‚Äù This is what a child does when he is told to clean his room: ‚ÄúMom this is so unfair, you always make me do everything and Emily is your favorite, she always gets what she wants! She got a laptop for Christmas!‚Äù The issue at hand isn‚Äôt Emily‚Äôs laptop, it‚Äôs whether or not his room is dirty.

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the differences between Gen Z and Millennials when it comes to relationships. Do you think a relationship between a Gen Z girl (1999) and a Millennial guy (1991) can actually work long-term?

There are obvious differences‚Äîlike how we use social media, approach work-life balance, and even communicate (texting vs. calling, meme culture, etc.). But do these differences really matter in a relationship, or do they make things more interesting?

If you‚Äôve been in a similar relationship (Gen Z + Millennial), what challenges did you face, and how did you make it work? Or did it not work out?

Instagram reels is a shit show now, I deleted that because there was a video of Indian girl dying at a Walmart in Canada, and apparently Canada has a bad problem with immigration so they were saying ""one down, many more to go"". I just scrolled on tik tok and saw a video making fun of Asian people at a basketball game with the caption ""Rets go brue devirs"" with 300 k likes. Seriously wtf is happening?

Though whenever someone says ai is theft I dont exactly agree. So heres the thing. If I told you to read 200 books and then write a book. You would definitely take into account the 200 books and use them as inspiration. AI does something similar and yet it is called theft and super evil and we should kill all people responsible for ai (hyperbole). 

  
I actually dont disagree that we should set up a better system to make sure artists are giving permission but AI art is being trained in a way wholly new. Its not that they take art to be copied to show to other people. Its using it to train itself in a way closer to humans.

  
Ultimately thought I wanted to spark a discussion here that doesnt end with ""all people who like AI should die in a deep pit"" and I am able to be convinced from my current stance.

GenZ,There is a generational divide for how we see Trump,1098,2025-04-01 02:23:43,970,"During his first term, for those of us in high school. There was much more of a  social stigma for supporting Trump than there is now. In 2017 he was seen much more harshly by women and minorities as his 2016 electoral base was much smaller and less diverse than now. Trump and the GOP weren't seen as the party of ""cool people"" and of the ""youth"". Hip Hop and nearly all form of pop culture was strongly against Trump and still had alot of nostalgia for Obama. While the most edgy openly supported Trump they were largely seen as outcasts. YouTube in 2016 wasn't so infested with far right politics and it would have been weird to see a Republican congressman on a podcast/ just casually hanging out with YouTubers. Trump was getting posted around with memes and his outlandish tweets but they were largely just seen as a joke. Older Gen Z could also see Trump as more ""illegitimate""  as he didn't win the popular vote. Fast forward to 2024 and Trump and the GOP are seen as ""cool,alpha, and for men"". Pop culture sees them more favorable and there on podcasts/YouTube. These attitudes for the GOP didn't exist in 2016 and 2020. Younger Gen Z also have no memories of a normal GOP candidate such as Mitt Romney, so there understanding is politics is always a chaotic circus. There is a generational divide in how Gen Z views the Trump era and I think it will be important in 2028 and the next decade or so. Younger Gen Z will likely view him more favorably, as they are also not going to be adults during most of his presidency. Also never faced as strong social stigma for supporting him, and have no memory of a strong democrat leader such as Obama. 

Edit:For a factual analysis, the 2024 Gen Z vote was much more pro Trump than in 2020 or 2016. This means new first time young voters swung hard for Trump.

Please put yourself in the person's situation and consider how much you value your own life over someone who is trying to end your life. Are you going to risk making your spouse and children see your mutilated corpse to give someone pointing a gun at you more chances than they've already had to surrender? Would you risk giving your spouse and/or children 20 years of trauma, grief and loss? And how would you be feeling after close calls and witnessing your coworkers and friends get violently murdered right in front of you as part of your job? I know some of you guys have trouble with empathy and looking at what the data says, but damn. Please don't fall for low effort propaganda about how police shooting at people who shoot at them is bigoted or police brutality."

Like, i am at collage, everone told me its best place to meet people, but not for me it seems. I made friends with some people in my class, but all of them are other women so i cant date them, i do talk with them, and are friends with some of them but they arent single and that's why we dont realy go out to places where we could meet other people, we just spend time with eachother, i tried clubs in my collage but they are so ,,dead"" its just wasting time to go on their meetings, usually there are like 3-5 people on meetings, they dont want to socialise, and mostly arent men. I tried hobbies and events, but i just met more women, or older people, it was nice i guess but i didnt meet anyone i could date its one thing the other i didnt even realy made friends either, people talked with me and seemed to enjoy it but it was brief and then we never met again. 

I saw people give advice such as try to seek and talk to people on street, cafes and i find it realy crazy, i mean, who does that? There arent places when you talk with strangers. I only have pubs and bars left it seem but one thing is i dont have anyone to go there (this are places you do with others not alone) and second i dont enjoy places like it that much.

I feel very tired of trying to seek places when i could meet someone, its frustrating im still lonely and still never be in relationship, i cant just break the cycle, it seem most people meet someone already at school or collage, and im left with nothing other than dating apps.

Its not only about dating though its hard to socialise, i have no idea where people meet other people as adults, im honestly glad social media exist because i can find some events and stuff to go and try meet people,, without that i would be at my home more, because i wouldnt know half the stuff that happens- when you dont have huge social circle like me you dont meet a lot new people because to meet people you need to know some people."

1. **Asking ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù instead of actually engaging**¬†‚Äì It feels like a lazy way to dismiss a point rather than explore it. If I say I don‚Äôt want to do something, I usually have a reason. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù rarely leads to an interesting conversation.
2. **Speaking in absolutes about subjective experiences**¬†‚Äì ‚ÄúEveryone loves this‚Äù or ‚ÄúNobody thinks that way‚Äù makes me instantly skeptical. People are diverse, and broad generalizations ignore nuance.
3. **Using credentials as a substitute for reasoning**¬†‚Äì Just because someone has a title or a degree doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre automatically right about everything. I respect expertise, but I need the reasoning, not just the authority.
4. **Responding to abstract ideas with overly practical concerns**¬†‚Äì If I‚Äôm discussing a theoretical concept and someone jumps in with ‚ÄúBut how would that work in the real world?‚Äù before engaging with the idea itself, it feels like they‚Äôre missing the point.

What about you?"
GenZ,"You see, when two people love each other very much... nothing happens.",83,2025-04-01 11:27:11,45,"Like I feel that many of us gen z that struggle with dating have it so difficult because of bad/inept social skills. Social media definitely plays a part in that as we've gotten to a point where our social interactions come primarily through digital means. 

We appear to have gotten such limited social experience in person that we don't know how to talk or even understand each other. We meet people, like their vibe and then just don't do anything about it about we're too scared. It makes me wonder how many lost relationships are out there just because each person waited for the other one to show interest first.

As a result we turn to the only way that feel natural to us which is the usage of dating apps. They're horrible though because they are so fake and don't give you a good opportunity of vibe checking someone. Anecdotal but I'll say that any time I used them I never felt like I showed the real me, that's not good.

A goal for all of us chronically online folks should be to become better at social interactions in person. To build character so we don't fumble talking to other humans. We can't just be at home, staying online constantly and withering away like hollows from DS. We need to do better."

GenZ,Is just me or are race relations just getting worse?,0,2025-04-02 03:36:59,27,"(I'm saying this as a edgy Mexican so take it easy)
I feel now as if the silly crackers I knew in 2016 are kind of vanishing off the web and from reality. I know the cultural war has gotten worse overall but I feel 2020 covid really kickstarted the ""immigrants and nonwhite people are an issue because Idk they just are here's conservative view point that doesn't acknowledge that the U.S. government WILL and HAS screwed over black people, mexicans and imigrants in general just because they felt like it"". 

I understand that white people in general shouldn't feel white guilt as that's not gonna solve any actually important culture wise but honestly I rather them be wokey wokey liberals that call me a latinx because as of right now as these whites are throwing their (just kidding everyones) rights away to get illegals out via plane without due process (btw why not bus wouldn't it be cheaper? The reason their doing it this way must mean this is purely performative right? To Spook us even?)
Like come they already mistakenly thrown a legal immigrant in an el Salvador mega prison and their saying that they can't take him back because it's not in their jurisdiction now? If that ain't a ""me when I lie"" Idk what is. Patriot act level of government over reach and ""conservatives"" are not saying a damn thing because as the old saying goes ""people don't mind a dictatorship as long as they're aligned with them"". 

I personally blame the atomization of peeps that got exacerbated during covid, the massive amount of conservative campaigning online and white women (not any other women they're mostly chill). By the way i like how conservatives are painting DEI as effective/defective progam that hired unqualified black people and activly neglecting the fact that it's white women who benefited the most. But what can ya can do, both political parties are full of hacks anyway who have no concern of doing what the people actually want them to do. 

And honestly it's a shame because I felt like we're were getting close to having genuine unity and going past race and into character but MLK is gonna have to keep turning for like an extra 14 years in grave probably before he can properly rest easy. 

And I understand that racism is gonna take a long time to recover from and peeps are gonna be racist for a long time but try to keep hate out of it.
It's not okay to have prejudices, as easy as life would be to have a group of people who objectively suck and to pin all the blame on, It doesn't work that way sadly. More importantly that mentality doesn't really solve things acts more of a cope and more of a persuasion tactic more than anything. 

Also fuck you if your racist with even seeing or interacting with other races (looking at you Midwesterners) atleast people who are racist and interact with other races have something to base it off of and not some boogey man propaganda. I know racism is mostly projecting negative stereotypes on races but please actually think for yourself! 

I really hope that race relations don't get any worse because I believe we're all gonna be bickering with lower living standards pretty soon and letting rich people delegitmize our government and turning this country into Brazil 2 Wealth Disparity Boogaloo staring peter thiel, elon musk, jeff Bezos, and Donald j trump.

That doesn't make you broken. That doesn't mean you're bitter. Some people process things differently. Some people grow up in silence and stay there. And some people don't fake emotions to fit in or be more likable.

You don‚Äôt owe anyone warmth just because you‚Äôre not in a relationship. You don‚Äôt have to be happy or open just to make others comfortable. Being cold or withdrawn doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre evil‚Äîit means you‚Äôve got your own way of moving through life.

GenZ,I don‚Äôt dream of contributing to corporate America my entire life,16,2025-03-31 18:53:23,33,"I am 22 and I have never had a job before. And no, it is not due to lack of trying. I have have been to three interviews in my entire life, and I was never hired because people want to hire ""experienced"" people. In the meantime, I have been babysitting/caring for my nephew since he was born. He is now 4, and I would truly give him my left kidney if he needed it. 

I have seen other Gen Z people talk about their disdain for their 9 to 5. They never have time for family, friends, of themselves. And sometimes they are labeled ""lazy"" for not wanting to be consumed by working. I have spent plenty of days with my nephew to know in my heart that I want to be a SAHM mom when I actually have children. My question is how are women surviving this? I feel lied to by the culture because we've been conditioned to believe that we should only focus on getting a degree and working for the next 20 years of our lives. But if we did that, we wouldn't have time for family and friends. Or creating a family.

How are women supposed to balance being moms and a 9 to 5? 
The culture has convinced us that we should value/find fulfillment in our careers and hustle culture, that motherhood is less important than running ourselves into the ground on our 9 to 5. I know that I risk sounding like a conservative when I say all of this. And I have never labeled myself as a conservative, but is it really so bad to want a different life? Becoming a SAHM mom would be more work. Of course. But I would rather be tired and fulfilled from being a mother than spend 6+ years to get a degree in a field that will take me 10+ years to earn a decent salary from. 

There are plenty of women who thrive being moms and working a 9 to 5, but I know in my heart that I am not one of them.

GenZ,The US election was decided by the economy. What are we supposed to do with that information?,5,2025-03-31 19:38:19,64,"This narrative is widely accepted, and doesn‚Äôt only apply to the US but also to the UK and Germany.

The gist is that the working class in the west has been stagnant or losing ground for over a generation now, and the post-COVID cost of living crisis is the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. The UK got a labour government, and Germany was able to keep the AfD out of government (for now), but the US has turned hard-right.

Leaving aside the notion that the Trump administration‚Äôs policies will be beneficial or even benign in their effect on the economy, what can we conclude from this narrative? What path forward can we ascertain from this perspective?

I think, none. What this story tells us is that the voter DEMANDS improvements in their standard of living year-on-year or else they‚Äôll vote into office a gaggle of hard-right nutjobs to revert society to feudalism. The issue is that those kinds of improvements might be simply impossible for advanced economies in the 21st century under any government. We‚Äôre already leveraged to the max with inverted population pyramids and the looming threat of climate change. The only hope in this scenario is that some kind of deus ex machina social or technological revolution comes in at the last second to save us all.

I think this narrative points in an inevitably hopeless and illiberal direction, like the Geist of the 21st century is one of decline and chaos. Curious to see what other young people say."

3.) College is expensive af. Seriously, even a degree in community can be expensive. For me, 1 class with grants, costed me 300 usd. And this is subtracting the book that the class didn't use. I had to quit after that because i couldn't afford community.

When I say young, I don't mean 18/20 years old, I mean 10/14, boys and girls that are very easy to influence and that don't have the necessary hindsight to recognize what's right or wrong. I know what you're going to say : ""It's the parent's responsibility."" That's true to an extent, but let's be realistic here : Nowadays, if a kid/teenager wants to watch a Kai Cenat stream, he will easily find a way, and most parents have no clue how any of this shit works anyway, or simply don't care.

So what's the problem with that ? Kid wants to watch cool popular guy on the internet, why am I complaining ?

Because that man probably is the WORST influence a kid could get on the internet.

-Invite rappers/athletes on stream that are either drugged out of their mind, often on the new trendy medication that kills hundreds a year OR/AND that have a horrible criminal record including violence, grape OR/AND that can't align 3 proper words in english because why would they bother.

-Invite women on stream with the ""hidden"" goal of sexualizing them, one way or another. Notice that these are the only streams where he avtivate chat to audio, so that his audience can also get a piece of the ""fun"". And then when he get caught doing this shit, like with the massage therapist, he plays it all innocent, like  a child that made a minor mistake. She was shocked, disgusted by the situation and didn't want to proceed with the massage, and Kai was like ""Oopsie, sorry for exposing you to my huge audience of absolute degenerates, who could've guessed ? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø""

-Homophobia and transphobia all the way, and that's basically all of AMP. That it gives you the ick is one thing, but to actively despise these communities in front of tens of thousands of people is another. Obviously he's not saying it loud and clear as he would get cancelled, but you can see in MANY of his reactions that he absolutely despise it, and he's not ashamed of it. To him and his friends, being gay = being bad (they're in their twenties, some of them in their thirties by the way).

-Overall glorification of the wrong lifestyle, for example showing off his superficial materialistic goods non-stop, big cars, big watches, big shoes. Saying the N-Word non-sb

What you don‚Äôt understand is stuff was just shittier back then. My dad drove a truck like this when I was little in the early 1980s. My brother and I would ride in the back, behind the front seats. If you‚Äôre wondering how a seat could fit in that spot: Imagine the crappiest kid‚Äôs booster seat you‚Äôve ever seen. Now make it much worse and set it on the floor of the truck, not bolted down, with its back to that little side window, kids facing each other. Add a lap-only seatbelt and call it a day.

GenZ,Nostalgia bait is getting ridiculous - and I think it's being weaponized,47,2025-03-30 11:27:53,21,"Anyone else noticed how ridiculously hard nostalgia bait is hitting lately? My YouTube Shorts just served me a 15-second, potato-quality clip of some grandpa eating the most basic McDonald's cheeseburger in 1997, and the comments were all like we'd just uncovered some lost golden age. Since when did a mediocre fast food meal become peak civilization?  

This reminds me of wrestling fans' never-ending cycle of nostalgia. Back in 2007, everyone watching Ruthless Aggression clips would complain ""Bring back the Attitude Era!"" Now those same RA videos have comments saying ""Bring back the Ruthless Aggression era!"" Feels like we're stuck in this loop where whatever happened 15 years ago automatically becomes the ""good old days.""  

Honestly starting to think nostalgia isn't just harmless reminiscing anymore. Remember South Park's Member Berries? Or Mr. Garrison wailing ""Where's muh country gone?"" Feels like that exact mindset has been turned into a cultural weapon. Makes you wonder how much of our current cultural/political mess stems from this manufactured longing for some imaginary past.  

Anyone else feeling this? Or am I just overthinking a dumb McDonald's video?"

1) Glycine 
2) Magnesium Glycinate 

I‚Äôve started taking these two supps and I‚Äôve slept like a baby. I normally fall asleep at 2-3am and wake up for work at 7am but ever since I started taking these two, I‚Äôve been knocking out at 10pm and getting some of the highest quality sleep I‚Äôve ever experienced 

I take them around 8:00pm and it kicks in 2 hours later. The bottle says it takes 30-60mins to kick in but I guess everyone is different. 

I get mine from Centenarius Nutrition (just google the company) . Extremely high quality. Highkey best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time for increasing life quality. Wanted to share this here because I know everyone in our generation struggles with sleep.

GenZ,What to do about a nonexistent dating life when everything else is going smoothly?,1,2025-03-30 22:22:02,21,"22M. Graduated college last year, since then have had a couple talking stages go nowhere. Recent app date where I got ghosted. Dating seems like a massive uphill battle while everything else in my life has come pretty easily, wondering what to do.

I work a decent white collar job, have plenty of disposable income, taking exams at a very fast pace in order to get credentialed in my field (where most pay increases come from). Everything good there. 

Tons of time spent on hobbies. Playing pickleball 2-3 times a week, getting some exercise in all 7 days a week most of the time. Lost 8 pounds, trying to lose 15ish more (but already started at a healthy weight, just slimming down to try to get back into intense running). Bowling a league once a week, have bowled very well the last two months. Coaching youth bowling on Saturdays, have pretty good rapport with the kids now, that‚Äôs been fun. Good relationship with my parents, see them often. Made a lot of new friends here and have people to do stuff with. Still in touch with most of my college friends. Traveling out of state once a month.

And yet it doesn‚Äôt feel like enough. I‚Äôm occasionally lonely. I want to date, but am getting nowhere. I rarely ever run into single women in my day to day life. I might get two matches a month off apps and very rarely get a date. I have limited experience, and don‚Äôt know exactly who all I‚Äôd be compatible with, and it seems hard to figure out without getting actual experience. It seems to be draining me some. I‚Äôll put effort in on apps, get nowhere, share struggles with friends and talk about how hard it seems to be. Yet if I just totally detach from trying to put effort in how would I know it‚Äôs time to try again? I don‚Äôt have a personality type that lends itself to having relationships just fall into my lap. It‚Äôs seemingly going to take effort at some point. But what type of effort? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm making this post. Any thoughts welcome!

It‚Äôs definitely frustrating to be sitting around at 6‚Äô, 170 and in great cardio shape, plenty of hobbies, plenty of female friends who all think I‚Äôm a kind person. Because a lot of the advice on the internet would have you think women are knocking down my dorm, yet I‚Äôm certainly not experiencing that."

Millennials already saw a decline in marriage compared to previous generations, and I wonder if Gen Z will continue that trend, or maybe take a different path entirely.

There are so many factors that could be influencing our generation‚Äôs outlook on marriage:

	‚Ä¢	Rising cost of living and housing
	‚Ä¢	Student loan debt
	‚Ä¢	Changing views on traditional institutions
	‚Ä¢	Prioritizing careers, independence, or mental health
	‚Ä¢	Normalization of long-term cohabitation without marriage
	‚Ä¢	Awareness of divorce rates and failed relationships and how courts tend to favor women in divorce
	‚Ä¢	Social media and unrealistic expectations around love and success
	‚Ä¢	And even the accessibility of pornography, which some argue might affect how people approach intimacy, commitment, or even motivation to seek real relationships

Personally, I feel like more of us are either skeptical of marriage or just not in a rush, but I also know plenty of people who still want it eventually.

GenZ,I think i have a solution to solve the indoctrination of the black pill or red pill,0,2025-03-30 18:02:52,107,"So I (21M) just finished watching *Adolescence*, and it got me thinking about what parents can do to prevent their children from being indoctrinated into harmful ideologies. What I came up with almost sounds like lecturing a child about death and mortality‚Äîand how to stop focusing on the negativity of it. It's no surprise that many guys nowadays find it hard to attract women.

I personally believe this is largely due to the internet and social media inflating physical standards for both men and women. I think parents need to tell their sons the cold, hard truth: the idea of simply meeting a girl, falling in love, and building a family is going to be very difficult to achieve. But instead of obsessing over that, there are so many other things in life they can focus on.

I‚Äôm only sharing this advice because it‚Äôs what I did for myself. Whenever I started feeling down about my inability to attract or date women, I shifted my focus to other things in my life‚Äîlike my dream of building a successful business, traveling the world, maybe even going to space, writing my own book, creating a comic book with an original character and universe, or making a video game. I know that might sound delusional, but focusing on those goals instead of my dating problems actually led me to stop caring so much about whether women were attracted to me or not.

All I‚Äôm saying is, parents need to stop selling delusions to their sons. They should be honest about the realities of dating and attraction, but also teach them that life is about much more than that‚Äîand there are other meaningful things they can pursue that will bring them happiness.

  
Also there is a chance you don't like this opinion feel free to comment any form of criticism you have.

But I just want to say that IT IS NOT THE PHONE! IT IS SOCIAL MEDIA! PLS DO NOT MIX THIS UP!

Smartphones are wonderful tools that enable us to do a lot of very useful things. Organizing Stuff with synced Calendars, Notes and ToDo's, electronic payment, satellite navigation, being able to call emergency services within a few seconds and so on...

These things are almost essential nowadays, including for teens. But somehow people always blame the device itself instead of the online platforms or the companies behind them.

We NEED more Gen Z folks there. Preferably in DC if you can make it. We are on the precipice of turning into a dictatorship if people continue to only talk about how they don't like things, yet do nothing else. The only thing that will stop this is if people flood the damn streets on a regular basis and get out of the house and politically active in their communities. And just like the protests in the '60's were filled to the brim with youth, we need that here too. It's essential for political movements to have voices of the future.  

I'm an Xennial. After Trump's inauguration I've been to 3 political meetings, 2 protests, 1 polling place to vote, and 1 town hall. At all but one of these it was a sea of grey hair, which SERIOUSLY concerns me. Young people, where the hell are you?! Come on, Gen Z, I'm begging you to get off the couch and into the streets if you don't wanna see these ghouls win. And bring your friends. I never want to hear any of you say ""OK Boomer"" again when they are the ones who protested in the '60's and are STILL doing it today. Protesting for YOUR rights! And a lot of them are gonna be gone before you know it. 

And if you're young and already politically active, thank you and keep it up. "

But sometimes knowing isn‚Äôt enough. Sometimes seeing it really set it in. Be thankful guys, for every little blessing you have. Never forget what you‚Äôve been through, never forget how you are.

GenZ,Is it ok to admit you are a flawed person and just waiting for the right person to come along?,2,2025-03-28 23:48:05,25,"This post is going to be about someone with autism. If you cannot be at least a little bit kind it is probably best to just stop reading now. If you decide not to be kind that is ok (I am not perfect either) and I will still happily read and respond to whatever you write. Just know I get nothing (no enjoyment, no hatred and no emotions) over cruel responses. I find it best just to give everyone the benefit of the doubt :)

One aspect of being autistic is the realization that you are probably always going to be a little bit different. Never quite going to fit in the same way. Being autistic on some level means that you will not be the perfect social person. In some way you will probably have a failing or a fault (not that we all don't it can just be a tad more obvious for someone with autism).

We seemed to have turned dating into some sort of quest where people try to improve themselves to be more appealing to a potential mate. Part of my autism is that I have no interest in competition. I guess I can just leave it at that.

People seem to love to tell other people what to do to get a romantic partner. Get fitter, get a better job, have a nicer house, live alone, have this degree, have this many friends, well you get the idea. I think part of learning how to handle my autism is an acceptance that I am not a perfect person. I am never going to be neurotypical and have a normal life.

That is all fine. I like who I am, and I know what I offer. I know what kind of person might work with me.

When I was younger and living a more traditional life, I always felt I needed to offer more to get a girlfriend. I needed to be taller, I needed to have the right friends, I needed to not wear glasses, I needed to play a sport, I needed to have any number of a hundred things in my life. I think I always let that hold me back since I never felt good enough.

Guess what, since I never felt good enough to be in a relationship I never got into a relationship.

I think with my autism diagnosis I want to work hard to accept myself for who I am. Not feel I constantly have to improve or change things in order to get into a relationship.

So, I admit, I am not perfect. I am very very flawed. I am certainly not everyone's cup of tea and I a certainly an acquired taste. I think I can live with all that though :)

I think I can offer and bring things to a relationship that very few other people can bring, and I believe that is where my confidence comes from :)

So, I have just noticed how negative reddit seems to be towards people who take this stance. That they are good enough as they are. Do people think it is really bad to tell the world you are flawed and you are just waiting for the right person?

To me it seems like the most honest answer and something no one should look down on.

Thank you so very much :)"

GenZ,DAE never answer the phone or door unless you recognize the person/number?,4,2025-03-28 09:19:54,11,"My dad said one time answering the door is an important part of being an adult, and I've never understood why.  If I don't recognize/expect the person, they're either trying to sell me something or impersonally asking for help with something.  I just don't see the point.  I can't recall a time when I answered the door and something productive happened, so I just stopped doing it. "

GenZ,Is there anything we GenZ can do to preserve our constitution?,141,2025-03-27 14:34:28,557,"I immigrated to the US because I truly believe in the ideals of the constitution. I love the fact that rights recognized (not given) by the constitution is universal and innate to every human being. I know America has not always lived up to that ideal, but we keep trying. 

The past few weeks have been horrifying, blatant disregard of the 1st and 4th amendment. ICE being used as the gestapo for a foreign govt's interests is icing on the cake. 

I don't want to America, the beacon of liberty, to slide down into authoritarianism like the country I emigrated from. I want to preserve the hope for my children as well.

What can we as GenZ do? I have called my rep in congress, went as expected. Boomers had more success in the 60s in opposition to Vietnam without all the tools we have. 

America has given a lot to me; I want to give back, but I don't know how."

GenZ,Leave social media fr.,69,2025-03-27 16:52:33,84,"Now that I‚Äôm off social media (besides this lol) My life is so much better. My next step is gonna be getting rid of my phone completely and just using a flip phone.

But now, when I have conversations with people that use social media all the time, they seem so anxious and depressed and not grounded in reality. They‚Äôre convinced life is shit and everyone is just as anxious and worried as them. But also like their priorities are so skewed. Like instead of worrying about the fact that their peers don‚Äôt have clean drinking water (this is just in my city, and is something we could actually fix if we focused our energy on it) they‚Äôre worried about shit 10,000 miles away that they have no control over SOLEY because people on instagram or tik tok told them to worry about it. Not bc they actually care. And then instead of doing anything about it, they get back on social media and continue to consume content about it. Then wonder why they‚Äôre so worried and think everyone is sad and anxious.

So I try telling them the reason you feel this way, isn‚Äôt because that is what life is like, it‚Äôs because of social media. You wouldn‚Äôt even know about 90% of that shit if you just left. And you don‚Äôt NEED to know about 90% of that shit bc there‚Äôs literally nothing you can do about it. And even if there was something you could do about it, you WONT bc you spend every ounce of spare time you have consuming social media. And they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh but I love social media I don‚Äôt know how I could live without it‚Äù okay cool. But please do not genuinely believe EVERYONE is like YOU bc you refuse to enter the real world.

I know a lot of people are sharing this sentiment on social media, wishing they could go back to the 80‚Äôs, 90‚Äôs, 2000‚Äôs, 2010‚Äôs even. I‚Äôm here to tell you, the only difference between those decades and now is social media. If you turn that shit off you‚Äôll realize we‚Äôre still very much there. Like actually leave that shit and do something worthwhile. I guarantee you will hate yourself so much less, and you won‚Äôt be as stressed and anxious and depressed and worried. You‚Äôll just feel normal. And then seeing shit on social media you once thought was so important, will not matter anymore. And new things will begin to matter that are actually way more important. "

GenZ,Gen Alpha slang that Gen Z never uses,1,2025-03-28 14:55:26,8,"Hey, I know almost no one from Gen Alpha. But everyone I supervise at work is Gen Z (they're all around 20) and recently I've started to hear them use a lot of slang that I keep reading online is ""Gen Alpha slang."" I don't know what half of it means.

My employees don't like Gen Alpha, and they relentlessly tell me about how cringe they are, but I think (despite this) middle schooler slang is rubbing off on them. So, please, help me understand the difference here:

What's the actual Gen Alpha slang that y'all wouldn't be caught dead using? And what are some of their slang terms that you will use? As a Millennial I noticed during the online transition from M > Z, there were slang terms that popped up which I was totally cool with using but this also didn't last very long. "

GenZ,Why the future of the earth is happy and not sad,0,2025-03-28 16:45:29,22,"Sometimes I feel like Gen Z is just bombarded with negative news, especially about the environment, so he's something positive instead. The simple gist is future people will be a lot more environmentally minded than we are, there will be less people, and they will have more tools to fix things.

The next 2 decades will be some progress and some setbacks environmentally but zooming out to 100-200 years down the road, it's pretty clear the earth is going to rapidly recovering. What our level of tech advancement is and our level of prosperity is is questionable, but the shape of the earth is all positive trends. Why?

The less people thing is destiny now - there's gonna be less people in 2150 than there is today. We've already passed thresholds of growing GDP while reducing energy use per capita. But we're still growing the capitas. Watch what happens when the capitas go down and and efficiencies improve. The bulk of environmental damage is from feeding ourselves - and with less people that means a lot of potential restored habitat and restored fish populations.

And the people that are living then will be a lot more environmentally minded than we are. Why? When people make more than $7000 a year and are educated, they actually care about their surroundings instead of being simply survival focused. The amount of uneducated people making less than $7000 will be tiny in the future compared to how many we have now. Look at what we were doing 150 years ago. We shot all the buffalo, sliced down most all of the redwoods, plowed the plains up, and nobody gave a shit. Further back humanity killed most of the mega fauna when there was only like 1,000,000 cavepeople wandering around. You'd be an idiot to think that people won't care in the future, especially with full satellite view and phones recording every piece of damage that happens globally.

Finally, more tools to fix. This is the most controversial part. It is questionable how much more or less prosperous we'll be in the future. Looking backwards can provide context. There's an outdated view that history is golden ages and dark ages, but when you look at daily life for the average 'peasant' instead of looking at columns and paintings, it's pretty much a continual story of human progress over time. The stone and bronze ages were incredibly brutal and violent - classical antiquity was flat out barbaric in China and Rome with slaves doing everything compared to the middle ages etc... So again, why the heck would we suddenly have a great leap backwards? If we didn't shred ourselves completely in the 20th century, its' a lot less likely in the 21st. I don't think we'll all have private planes in 2100 level of prosperity, but it's also wrong to assume we're gonna go back to horses too.

Won't climate change screw the earth over. No. They do estimates on this and scientific consensus is a couple GDP points. That's less impactful than Trumps trade crap. Any ecosystem collapse would be factored into a GDP calc, it can't not be. The worst case scenarios for emissions aren't being met. What happens when Greenland melts? We just all of Canada melt 10000 years ago with 400 feet of sea level rise and rapid warming. What happened? Go look for yourself.¬†[https://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nerc.html#maps](https://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nerc.html#maps), compare the ice age climate for every continent compared to today. The ice age climate sucked, scientific fact. And we're gonna have geoengineering tools in 2150 to address any feedback loops.

There's a book called Not the End of the World that explains this excellently if you want chapter after chapter detailing the more immediate future.¬†[http://amazon.com/Not-End-World-Generation-Sustainable/dp/031653675X](http://amazon.com/Not-End-World-Generation-Sustainable/dp/031653675X)"

GenZ,Political Conversation,6,2025-03-27 23:51:28,51,"I would really like to harbor a conversation here about what people‚Äôs options are either if you are right and left. Things are so divisive right now, but I think at the end of the day we need to learn from each other. Left or right. That is the only way we grow and be able to maybe work together to be able to overcome the way the world is currently royally fucking us, or if you believe otherwise I really want to hear and understand. 

I‚Äôll start with my opinion I currently think that we have lost the American dream with our generation probably never be able to own homes, with a fear of having any of the kids that we have go to school without safety; school shootings lack of education and the push the children working. I‚Äôm scared that ice is going to take my friend who have green cards. I‚Äôm scared that the workforce is going to continue to get smaller and smaller, cause they cannot afford to have more employees. 

I‚Äôm scared of people not fostering communities during the dire  time because we are too concerned with ourselves as Americans. Which I deeply believe is is a problem with our society currently, I believe that Americans have been pushed to only see themselves to only see ourselves individuals to not see each other. We choose to support those who believe in war in genocide, minimize it to how it may be able to grow our nation without understanding or being empathetic to those who are losing their lives to the daughters to the sons the Moms, the Dads who lose their lives every day. 

I believe that we are taught from a young age to be good workers and to fall into a system, and to only think about yourself and with that we‚Äôve lost empathy, and with a empty,we have become narrow minded. We have narrowed our minds to only think about what‚Äôs good for us instead of understanding the community that‚Äôs around us instead of reaching out to our neighbors instead of reaching out to her friends and understanding how we can help them. 

I believe that‚Äôs why Trump was elected, people are concerned with how things will affect their wallets instead of understanding the live settle hurt. Not understanding that a man who only cares about money. His whole entire life is going to continue to do so. He doesn‚Äôt care about your well-being. I don‚Äôt believe that he care about your family your friends he doesn‚Äôt want to better yourself, because he wants more to line his pockets. And the people that will make his life easier, like his other billionaire allies. The reason why I think like this is because of his rhetoric, his actions, and those he supports actions.

I would love to have a productive conversation, I would like communication about other feelings right now who are from the same generation. I know here on Reddit can sometimes be hard to have real conversations like this, but I would like to try. "

I believe i am having a quarter life crisis (I'm 26) and discovered that i'm lonely

I chose not to date so there goes half my social life

I tried to make friends with other men, didn't go so well. I just don't resonate with other men. So i don't have any friends.

As for family, half of them don't even know I exist. And half of them don't want to talk to me since they are Catholic and i am a pagan and just think i worship evil.

Just sucks. I have accepted that i will always be alone but the feeling does still hurt"

GenZ,Did anyone else have a toxic phase online?,8,2025-03-27 21:59:03,9,"I'm not saying nearly to the extent I did, what I did was horrible.  I'm curious others who grew up around tech and went through this.

I used to say incredibly mean, toxic, insensitive things in an online game chat

I feel so much guilt and regret for this.  When I was 16-18 years old, I didn't have friends and my family relationships were bad so I would often sit alone on my computer playing online games.  These used to be a ton of fun for me, but eventually I got very skilled at them and anytime people were not as good, I would say hurtful things back.

I would tell people they had no friends and no one liked them, which was huge projection for my own self.  I would tell people I hope their family gets terminal illnesses and suffer.

Those were horrific things to say to people.  I feel even more guilty for that because both of my grandfathers died of cancer.  I watched them suffer and feel pain through the very things I wished on others as a teenager.  Their pain was horrible to see, I wish it could have been me instead.  I was a horrible kid.  I deserved to suffer that way, I feel like no matter how wrong I see it now, I always will have made a bad impact on others.  I can only hope the people I was mean too weren't too affected by it.  I wish I knew their names to apologize, I feel like I ruined so many people's days."

I don‚Äôt have a college degree so big cities haven‚Äôt been that beneficial for me, especially a city like NY where a lot of things are already established and they need a more experience workforce.

I‚Äôve been looking at the Midwest recently (the south is getting a bit too popular and I‚Äôm not a fan of bugs all year round. I‚Äôd die if I saw a flying roach). Cost of living is affordable, these states seem to be the most frontier like out of all states excluding the red states. I‚Äôm planning to do a trade and they also have extremely strong unions and many are in demand of workers.

What do you guys think? Is the Midwest a good place for someone who‚Äôs used to the city? Are any of you planning to move there? If not, why and where else are you planning to go?"

I was just listening to new PM carney voice his geopolitical distancing from America and I felt my heart drop. I felt an aching pit in my stomach and I had to take a step back to breathe. I felt like my stomach got punched. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes, I couldn‚Äôt believe my ears, I couldn‚Äôt believe anything. I‚Äôve been to Canada 6 times and I‚Äôve travelled to Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Qu√©bec City and I‚Äôve been to Halifax. When I went to Canada I was so enthralled by how progressive of a nation it is, the beauty of multiculturalism done right, of equal opportunity, of the social benefits to the inhabitants of so beautiful and so precious of a nation. When I went to Ottawa last summer I was intrigued by how such a nation could be so similar to my own yet so different at the same time. 

When I went to Canada last I was filled with such inspiration, such joy, and such hope that my own land could achieve the same success and progress your nation had achieved. I was so deeply destroyed upon the coming of Trump, I knew he was a monster, I knew he was the devil, but I didn‚Äôt know the anti-Christ he would come to be. 

Please know we are all not like this, please understand this! I love Canada with all of my heart and soul. I should‚Äôve been born a Canadian. I‚Äôm so jealous of the Quebecois and I‚Äôm so jealous of other Canadians. You are truly the best of all possible nations! I‚Äôm so sorry. Please just know we are all not like this. I am deeply ashamed of being American. I wish I had been born Canadian instead. 

I‚Äôm so so sorry for my country. You are the true Americans. You are the true defenders of liberty, justice, law, order, due process and empathy. You deserve the Statue of Liberty.

I just want to ask, why? Use a throwaway if you're too much of a coward, but how do you even get in the headspace to commit an act like this? Is it to own the libs? Do you think a traumatized woman is more likely to not vote at all? Are you frustrated at perceived advantages given to women and this is your way of retaliating? Are you treating it as a video game where you want that high score to show off to your altright buddies and are willing to break laws and destroy lives for that high score? Do you feel ugly, short, etc. and want to lash out at women who wouldn't touch you with a 10 foot pole unless you force them to?

I‚Äôm absolutely bored as hell. I have a great job close to home where I only have to be in office 3 days a week. I have a lot of liberty and great pay. I could be making more, but couldn‚Äôt we all. I feel respected at work especially after where I‚Äôve come from, work wise.

Sometimes I take so long getting ready for work because it kind of feels like Groundhog Day everyday. 

It‚Äôs in a field I like, but I‚Äôm bored as hell with life. I‚Äôm currently on a weight loss journey and I feel like a lot of my time is dedicated to that. I workout, sleep, and go to work. Not a whole lot of personal work and side businesses. 

I have products that I am in the process of selling for my side businesses, but with work and fitness, I‚Äôm too tired to even put it out. I have a TikTok dedicated to cooking and losing weight (and other things) but haven‚Äôt edited the videos because, tired.

I go to a work class about 1-2x a week. I hang out with my friends about 1-2x a week. 0 love interests at the moment. I had a potential FWB I knew from college but he ghosted me.

So I‚Äôve decided to just commit to myself, but working on yourself kinda gets boring lol. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to stop.

I‚Äôd get a tattoo, but I‚Äôm waiting until I lose weight so it looks right.

There‚Äôs a TikTok going around about not wanting to be an influencer, but wanting the opportunities it brings and that‚Äôs kinda where I am in my life. If I could, I‚Äôd be going state to state getting paid, exploring the new area, and getting paid somehow.

Just asking advice on how y‚Äôall boost yourself and live in a world/life you love.

The idea that Gen Z is entitled is not true; instead, they are discouraged because they were lied to by schools and parents.

This all comes from the same people that told them to go to college by any means necessary...even if that means taking out loans that they may not pay back for 10s of years. Gen Z isn‚Äôt asking for handouts, they‚Äôre simply trying to get the fair pay and opportunities they were promised.

For Gen Z workers, the only way to get big pay raises is often by job hopping. In the past, staying at one company for a long time meant promotions and raises, but today, companies don‚Äôt offer the same opportunities. Many businesses focus more on profits and cutting costs, leaving workers with little chance to grow within the company. This can make it seem like Gen Z lacks loyalty, but the truth is, companies aren‚Äôt loyal to their employees anymore. If workers want better pay and career growth, they usually have to change jobs, even if it means moving around a lot.

On top of that, schools and parents told Gen Z that following your passion would lead to a successful career, but the job market doesn‚Äôt work that way. Many entry-level jobs expect long hours for low pay or don‚Äôt offer any room to move up. Gen Z isn't rejecting hard work‚Äîthey‚Äôre rejecting unfair conditions. They want jobs that support their mental health, offer fair pay, and provide room to grow. Their push for these things isn‚Äôt entitlement, it‚Äôs just a reaction to the broken promises they were given. Instead of calling them lazy, maybe we should listen to their concerns and realize they want the same thing: a chance at a better future."

GenZ,Question about dating a girl as a 24 year old male,0,2025-03-27 19:49:04,57,"I‚Äôve been text-chatting on Snapchat with a girl(22) who I met on Tinder a few weeks ago. I like her a lot, she seems like a very nice person and is very cute and I would like to meet her in real life to hangout in-person some time soon

The problem is I don‚Äôt drive right now and I‚Äôm worried that if we meet and she finds out I don‚Äôt have a car then she won‚Äôt like me anymore. 

The reason why I don‚Äôt drive or have a car isn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt have a drivers-license or can‚Äôt afford a car(I do have a drivers-license I got when I was 18 and I have access to a car if I wanted to get one) I just don‚Äôt like driving because it makes me extremely paranoid and panicked and annoys the crap out of me so bad that I wanna smash the windows of the car while I‚Äôm driving it. 

Here‚Äôs what I DO have though: good hygiene, good style, a good amount of money, and my own nice apartment. I can pay for all our dates, buy her flowers, take her to nice stupid fancy restaurants that girls like going to and get us luxury uber rides. 

So does the one thing I don‚Äôt have (a car) disqualify me from being a guy who a girl would be attracted to and have respect for and view as a potential romantic partner? Or does not driving make me undateable? "

Sometimes, I wish I didn‚Äôt overthink texts so much. Like, just send the message without rereading it 50 times or overanalyzing why someone left me on read. But if I stopped caring, would I also lose the part of me that values deep connections?

Other times, I wish I had main character energy instead of always feeling like an NPC in my own life. It‚Äôd be cool to just exist without the constant existential crisis in the background. But would I still be the same person who notices all the little absurdities in life?

Or maybe I‚Äôd want to stop feeling burnt out 24/7, but at this point, I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs me or just the *vibe* of our whole generation.

So I go in circles. If I could change one thing about myself, I wonder if I‚Äôd end up regretting it.

One odd thing about telling someone that you are autistic is that they often ask you what your 'special interest' is. I am never offended or anything and I do not mind being asked at all. But I simply do not have a 'special interest.'

My interests, my passions, my loves are kind of spread out. I love music but I do not take it seriously. There might be one exception. I have really really wanted to meet the right person and get into a relationship since about the age of 20.

Not embarrassed, but I will admit to being 38, and will also admit to zero success yet. But obviously I have not given up. I suppose I lead a non-traditional life and between that and having autism that has not made things easy on me. But I am not here to complain.

I just know that a lot of people think making a relationship your biggest goal in life is a mistake. To be honest I have never understood this idea. To me what could be more important in life than love, looking and finding love. 

Admittedly things like money, status, career, have never meant all that much to me. What matters by far the most to me is my love life. 

I guess I am self-aware enough not to tell potential dates how important a relationship is to me. But deep down I have to admit it is by far the most important goal in my life. "

With the recent swing against trans identity in the US, I'm still seeing many people attribute what's being done with supposed ""trans rights"" as the latest move in the fascistic right movement, particularly in the younger generations, including Gen Z. 

Look, if you want to call Trump and the Republican party a right-wing populist fascistic movement, I don't even disagree. If you want to tell me that saying a man can't become a woman simply by dint of him saying so and official government documentation shouldn't validate a falsehood, is fascism, then you're wrong. It's completely sensible. The US left's inability to defend their side in this debate, gives the Republicans an easy out to look like the far more reasonable party even when most of their policies are not. 

You can scream until the cows come home that this is just a wedge issue used by the Republicans to distract but the reality is, the public cares about this issue and it's not going away until it's been adequately handled. Only one side has a coherent, defensible conception of sex, gender and trans identity and it's not the side telling you that Republicans switching their Fs back to Ms is just the first step in a literally trans genocide."

Just... I've gone my whole fucking life feeling like I've never felt home somewhere. Not that I haven't had places I belong to, friends, family, but it's never felt like *I* really belonged there.

I never got along that well with most guys, so I'd be in guy friend groups and then have like 2 people I was actually close to. Never really had most of the ""guy friend group"" experiences.

A lot of the time I've been in girl friend groups as the *only guy*, which while it's very comfortable and nice it's just like.... still isolating from time to time.

And then just add shit like this over and over again. I guess it just never really feels like I'm not the exception. I remember having a moment in high school I realized I'd never fit in so I just wouldn't bother trying to tamper down my personality, either, which is why I'm usually loud and kind of obnoxious. Because it makes no difference whether I try and be smaller or bigger, but being bigger feels better. It feels nice to take up space sometimes.

I think I'm mostly at some kind of peace with it all, but it doesn't make it any easier. It just means I've realized I can't fight it, and I just do the best I can. Even if that's still a bit lonely."

GenZ,"Hey Gen-Z, millenial here and former Navy and Naval Intelligence",3057,2025-03-25 04:48:10,412,"Generation Z, we have a problem that only you and Gen Alpha will, unfortunately, experience. Even during the Bush Administration and the lead up to Iraq War, there were not two competing sets of reality, and most informed people understood George W. Bush Administration to be lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq for example.

You all exist within a different paradigm, a paradigm where there are more than one competing viewpoints of the world, and in fact, since the Trump Administration is no longer countering misinformation coming out of Russia, you may have to deal with 3 or 4 competing sets of reality. 

What I suggest you do is tune out of MOST corporate news sites and only try to get your news from reputable sources like the Associated Press, Reuters, or The Financial Times. Those three outlets are rather neutral in their reporting and all the corporate news sites report news reported from either Reuters or the AP. 

Your government is not going to protect you from foreign sources of misinformation as those foreign misinformation agents do what they are doing to benefit Trump and destroy the United States of America as a Republic. Do not let them trick you.

Feminism is not the problem, minorities are not the problem, LGBTQ people are not the problem, immigrants are not the problem, but I will tell you what the actual problem is, are you ready?

#Wealth and Income Inequality drives all the problems within our society 

And both parties have allowed the billionaire class to get away with this wealth extraction, but if we keep our eye on the ball, and tax wealth, not work, we can beat them. There are more of us than there are of them

Also, like I said, your government is not going to protect you from foreign threats, so remember if you're arguing on here with someone, it may be a bot meant to cause division. Remember, always come back to wealth and income inequality! 

The fact that a few people have concentrated their wealth so much that they are now openly interfering in our politics shows you that we are in the end stages of this, and we either need to come together, or we are going to LOSE. 

I still bear faith that your generation will see through all this bullshit, and come together with millenials to fight back against this anti-democratic, anti-constitutional, and Anti-intellectual movement. 

Remember, oligarchs are kings and in America, we don't do that shit. "

GenZ,Describing yourself as 'Anti-Woke' is literally dumb,349,2025-03-25 16:17:34,257,"Disclaimer: This is more of a rant but the topic is too engrained in politics.

The phrase 'Lost in translation' comes to mind and I'm speaking very literally. From Googling: ""*...originally meaning alertness to racial prejudice and discrimination. It is synonymous with the General American English word awake.*"" So just to be clear, anyone who describes themselves as 'anti-woke' is specifically pro being ignorant to racism? They want to be asleep with respect to racial injustice? I don't think anyone genuinely argues this and the meaning of the words make no sense when people use them. The ideas people think the words represent and how they feel is one thing. **But can we agree that literally the way the words 'anti-woke' are used makes no sense?** I feel the same way about 'Antifa', I heard people say it for years, and it blew my mind once I made the connection that Antifa = Anti-Fascism. So in the same irony, everyone against Antifa is pro-fascism. I don't understand how the way these words are used gets so far away from their definition. I guess we can chalk it up to weaponization of the media.

EDIT: Antifa is a bad comparison. People have pointed out the difference in an organization. "

GenZ,"Netflix‚Äôs Adolescence, thoughts?",0,2025-03-26 20:07:37,80,"Main focus aside, I liked it enough. The acting was good and it was written to look like what I‚Äôd image actually happens in legal proceedings given my Hollywood knowledge. I did feel compelled for a child in the first episode but I didn‚Äôt even finish the second before I was thinking he‚Äôs guilty. 

But main topic at hand, i dont even wanna call it toxic masculinity because that‚Äôs just an element of it. I felt it was intentional when (I‚Äôm bad with names and I just watched this last night üôàü´£) the main female officer is explaining her grief at everyone forgetting Katie as a juxtaposition to the therapist questioning Jamie about her. The therapists role was always a guarantee but as an experienced officer the erasure of a victim is commonplace as wrong as it is and she was saying this to another experienced officer. 

So cut to the therapists questioning, it reminded me of the fact that Katie is a bully. Yes of course Jamie should have said something before feeling this emotionally compelled but it reminded me most importantly that this was probably the first time Jamie had said to anyone other than his friends he was being being bullied. He struggled to vocalize his perspectives on gender but he was already protective of his due to the nature of the bullying.

So I‚Äôm curious if others would agree that rather than calling things like this products of toxic masculinity we call it a compounding of sexism because in living breathing cycles of life, things like this become a chicken or the egg situation. We do it as much to ourselves as we do it to each other because keep in mind the therapist‚Äôs emphasis earlier in the session that her opinions didn‚Äôt matter. Ofc it was literal in a judicial sense but it‚Äôs also homage to the concept of words having power if we give it. Jamie could have chosen right at the end to like himself for being honest and believing that was worthy of approval (and I guess he did since he changed his plea) especially with the reality of the situation, but he was desperate to know if this already established beautiful, clever woman thought he was worthy of friendship. The show is fictional but some people lose so much of their humanity that they can‚Äôt even see the ability to take another human life as a sickness and it‚Äôs because we are more fragile than we really give credit to our species. It continues the cycle of hurt ppl hurting ppl. 

Before anyone gets heated, I say all this just to bring up how sad shit is in general and I think ppl need to stop playing a game of oppression Olympics bc there is always someone in the world who has it worse than you. Rather than focusing on that we should be focusing on how to make it better, arguing about the right or wrong path rather than arguing about where we‚Äôve been."

A bunch of my fellow Gen Z in my courses didn't know about it, and we ended up having a two-hour long discussion with our professor about it.

Prisons are privately owned and funded. They purchase a lot of supplies from private companies: Medicine/Medical-supplies, food, security systems, infrastructure, energy, etc.... They receive **profit** from keeping their prisons full, and if they don't, it can damage multiple industries that are connected to the prisons.

More crimes in other countries that would send someone to therapy or a fine, would send someone in the U.S. to a prison for months or years. And it's not for rehabilitation efforts, it's purely to confine them as a felon.

.... How many of us Gen Z actually know this? I mean, I know millennials and a few boomers in my life who have ***zero idea*** this was the case over there, including family who live down in the U.S.

Moral relativists on the Right will accuse us of not applying moral standards equally when not only they themselves do not apply moral standards equally, but when moral standards themselves do not apply equally.

White supremacists will accuse you of being racist when you support DEI. Child traffickers will accuse you of traumatizing children for supporting LGBT. Terrorists will accuse you of being terrorists for your political activism. Every accusation is an admission.

Just like guns are not meant to be wielded by criminals, free speech is not meant to be a right for promoters of hate and violence. The wrongful death of a CEO, while a condemnable tragedy that must be punished to the fullest extent of the law, is not morally equivalent to the wrongful deaths of normal people that such a CEO might have played a part in.

Morality is relative, and the Right believes this more than anyone else- do not let them attack you with accusations of not applying morality equally."

When they default on their loan(s), I write the complaint and get it filed, and I also handle the pretrial and post-judgment stuff.

I do not know why I never realized that, but I am rolling on molly right now after a sex crazed night, so I guess my brain's activity is off the charts right now because I never realized the company I work for was essentially extracting (taxing) the wealth from these businesses at a fixed percentage, usually around 3-7%.

Also, if I consider taxes to be people paying society back for its services society provides such as clean water, etc etc etc, and a means to control wealth and income inequality in our democratic republic wouldn't that technically be considered an interest payment? Taxes = Interest 

We are paying society back for things owed.

#Edit 2

What is a wealth tax? 

A wealth tax is¬†imposed on the value of some or all of a taxpayer's assets, such as stocks, real estate, and businesses. At the federal level, the United States does not have a wealth tax, and many other countries have repealed wealth taxes because of administrative challenges.

I think we can use the billionaire's copyright-theft-AI technology to find solutions to some of those administrative challenges.

GenZ,I don't know how to make friends online until,0,2025-03-25 22:21:11,9,"Okay, real talk‚Äîanyone else feel like existing social media is just a never-ending audition for validation? Like, you post something you‚Äôre¬†*lowkey*¬†proud of, refresh every 5 seconds for likes, and then spiral when your follower count drops because someone decided to peace out? üíÄ¬†*Deadass*, why is everyone here just... performing?

GenZ,"The ""she wasn't right for you to begin with"" cope isn't sustainable",0,2025-03-26 12:56:17,30,"See it all the time on Reddit but especially on this sub. I don't know who or what's been feeding this idea to young people.

You get people saying stuff like ""I was emotionally weak in front of my gf and she lost attraction to me and left"" or ""My gf cheated on me with someone who's better in every way"". And the response is always some variation of ""She wasn't good for you to begin with. She was a bad person, you dodged a bullet, it's actually a blessing in disguise. You will find a new person who loves you for who you are bro."" Are those new people in the room with us right now bro?üòÇ

No, you shouldn't have been emotionally weak when she doesn't have enough invested in your relationship to forgive you for it. No, you should have been a better man with more money, a better body, and a better personality. At some point you can't be 25, 30, 35, 40 years old with the same cope of ""I dodged a bullet"". You can't hold out for those exceptions to the rules, it's rarer and rarer to meet people as time goes on and they probably have boyfriends already anyway.

Stop coping or it's going to be too late one day."

Which is your favourite this year? Did you ever heard of eurovision? Did you ever watch it?

For those who don't know anything about it:
Eurovision song contest is a song contest, with countries from all over Europe and some other countries (I**ael and Australia), which it has it's roots in the 50s. First winner was Switzerland. 1974 Abba was the winner. They just got known because of eurovision. In 1988 Celine Dion sang for switzerland and got first - she just got known because of eurovision.
The winning nation is the host of the next edition of the contest. 
This year is the 69th eurovision (yep, that's why we have 3 songs that are a little bit over the top in a way).
The countries are not obligated to sing in their language anymore, so they can sing in any language they want.
The grand final on saturday has more viewers than the super bowl. So for us europeans it is a big thing."

GenZ,What happened to little kid‚Äôs cartoons?,36,2025-03-24 23:14:22,31,"So i was babysitting a baby nephew today and let him watch some tv. He started out watching paw patrol. The only little kid‚Äôs cartoons ive heard about over the past decade are paw patrol and bluey because i dont have kids myself. So i sit down thinking ‚Äúok its one of the only ones ive heard about so it has to be at least decent.‚Äù 

That show was so annoying. The music and singing was especially bad. Parents idk how you put up with that. Eventually I remembered one of my favorite childhood shows Bear & The Big Blue House and found it on Disney +. I told my nephew it was what i watched when i was a baby and he got excited so we watched it. The difference in quality was night and day. The music and singing was actually good and the songs were actually fun. The characters werent coming across as annoying. Even the lessons it was teaching was better because it wasnt just ‚Äúand then the dogs saved the day.‚Äù Lessons from Bear actually had him sitting down with the childlike characters and processing the way they felt. It actually dove in a little deep from time to time. 

How is it that we had better quality shows growing up. My parents kept some old VHS tapes of shows like Bear & The Big Blue House, Wiggles, Bob The Builder, and Blues Clues. Im grateful they did because if i ever have kids thats what theyre getting raised on. I havent seen Bluey before but if its as good as Paw Patrol then letting my theoretical kids watch those shows will drive me insane. 

The whole experience just made me appreciate the shows we had growing up and makes me wonder why the quality dipped. "

GenZ,I feel bad for young gen Z/gen alpha,3,2025-03-25 06:59:00,24,"I don't mean this in a hating way, my younger cousins are some of my favorite people ever I love them to death and I don't think there's anything wrong with their generation or anything.

But I feel bad in terms of how much technology, social media, and ai they're growing up with at such a young age. In middle school I had musically but it was literally random dances, and  I didn't get Instagram until I was 14 but reels weren't a thing then so I just kept up with my friends and celebrities. Literally the only comments I would check would be the ones for my friends and like, harry styles lol. Also, suggested feed wasn't too much of a thing and since everyone used to post all the time, my feed was genuinely only people I knew and celebrities.

But now, you basically see the lives of people around the world on TikTok and Instagram, with an extreme amount of comments with a lot of them being quite toxic and negative especially on Instagram. If this affects ME, I can't imagine how 11, 12, 13, 14 year old me would have felt growing up with this. It would have made me insanely insecure. And don't get me started on AI--there was literally no way to really cheat (besides for math I guess) unless you had a super smart friend or wanted to look up every single answer and try to find it on a random website, so I didn't have that temptation. 

I just feel bad younger kids/teens have to grow up with this, I can't imagine having been exposed to all of this at such a young age, i remember just seeing my own friends' posts could make me insecure, now there's like unlimited amount of people u can compare yourself too. My younger cousin is always comparing herself to random girls' lives online and I genuinely feel bad"

I graduated high school in 2007, I remember there were preppy kids, jocks, Goth type, emo, or punk, or scene, theatre kids, and some stereotypical misfits.  You see it a lot in even older movies, movies from the 90s or especially 80s.
For instance, the movie The Breakfast Club, They each had their stereotype, and there was that stereotypical ‚Äúweird‚Äù girl. 
And you honestly see it in so many 90s movies. 
Anyways, that being said, I‚Äôve met some Gen Z people through work or through wherever. Even just social media or looking up whats trending  on Reddit or what‚Äôs mainstream. I don‚Äôt really see that with GenZ generation. 
I feel like people blend more together, people are more authentically themselves and don‚Äôt try to fit into a group. It‚Äôs super refreshing. I could look at a huge class of highschoolers and I can‚Äôt tell who would be friends with Who. It‚Äôs honestly oddly satisfying.

Because during that time as well, I was going through a break up..my classmates would make fun of me because I let an ""4 eyed mongoose"" cheated on me. But now that im 22 I think I have broken away from mysognistic ideologies/content.

Im worried about my 8year old brother though because his father treats him horrible. Any form of slight crying it leads to dad yelling ""Are you a little girl? You behaving like a damn girl these days, why you crying for?"". Plus he's always watching brainrot on his tablet..im gonna try to monitor and be there for him.

One last thing:

Healthy masculinity is about being true to yourself, treating others with respect, and embracing emotions like kindness, vulnerability, and empathy. It‚Äôs about building relationships based on equality and care, not control or dominance. Toxic masculinity, on the other hand, pressures men to suppress emotions, act tough all the time, and view relationships as competitions or power struggles. Red pill masculinity takes this further by promoting harmful ideas like men being superior to women and seeing relationships as transactional. While toxic masculinity isolates and harms both men and those around them, healthy masculinity helps you grow into a confident, kind, and balanced person who can build meaningful connections with others.

You essentially have no outside resources.

You do have a mom‚Ä¶but she is struggling financially herself & lives in an apartment with multiple roommates. If you moved in with her you‚Äôd be sleeping on the couch and hope that roomates don‚Äôt report or complain.

Your mental health would crumble living on your mom‚Äôs couch‚Ä¶but if you did go this route‚Ä¶what financial goals would you have set to complete and by when?? Essentially how long would you do this for?

Okay current monthly bills:

Can we take a moment to appreciate how our guy, President Trump, pulled off the most epic comeback in history? Winning the 2024 election with 312 electoral votes and even securing the popular vote?  That's legendary status right there.

Remember when everyone said it couldn't be done? They doubted, they laughed, but who's back in the White House now? That's right, the man who understands us Gen Z folks better than anyone. He gets the importance of strong leadership, booming economies, and, let's be honest, the best social media game out there.

So, while the mainstream media tries to spin their narratives, we know the truth. America is winning again, and it's all thanks to the tremendous leadership of President Trump. Let's keep the energy high and continue to support the movement that's making our country great again.

Stay winning, my friends!

GenZ,Is anyone else treating socializing as a numbers game at this point.,10,2025-03-23 22:37:40,3,"So I'm a older GenZ  and recently I've been trying to expand my social circle. After a few ""try hard"" attempts I realized the relationships that formed became vary one-sided and solely reliant on myself to maintain contact. 

Due to this unpleasant outcome I decided I needed to change my mind-set and how I approach socializing and to my surprise it ended up giving me some better results. Of course I'll warn you that even though I've done this my actions don't truly align with my morals.

I realized I needed to become a little more shallow when approaching people and view anyone who rejects first/second time invitations without reason as scared losers that aren't worth my time. 

Then I started inviting anyone and everyone who I didn't believe was mentally unstable, strangers or not. It started out slow and with alot of rejection but,  funny enough, the more people heard how active my personal life was the more willing people were to accept invitations.

After 3months my social circle went from 11 contacts to 43 contacts. Of course it might be because I'm 26yo and at this age more people start to realize it's okay to talk to strangers. Younger GenZ I've noticed basically run whenever you say hello unless there in a situation that forces them not to (like work, team events, or club activities).

Anyone's else doing the same? What's your experience?"

I‚Äôm in college now and it‚Äôs really fucking depressing to see how apathetic everyone is. Even in my political science class, nobody raises their hand. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs afraid. I don‚Äôt entirely blame them, most are immigrants and now they‚Äôre even coming after naturalized citizens (whose parents are legal too). But it‚Äôs still super dystopian to see that those who have no reason NOT to speak out just choose not to. 

It feels rude to talk about the real world with anyone. We all talk about how dire things are getting here online but how much of an effort do we put in irl? Should it matter if we sound rude at this point? Maybe a year or two ago, I would‚Äôve rolled my eyes if people would be being up politics all the time but at this point, everything is becoming straight up dystopian.

GenZ,24 and lost,5,2025-03-23 16:27:30,23,"I‚Äôm coming up to being 25 and things just feel a bit lost. 

Let‚Äôs start with jobs. I‚Äôve been in a warehouse for nearly 8 years, applied to other jobs and for promotions within the company. Only to be turned down at every turn at the company I work at, almost receiving no interviews, let alone a response to jobs outside my warehouse role. Part of it I believe is down to the current state of the job market in the UK, the other is down to the 30 years experience I don‚Äôt have that I should‚Äôve collected before I was born.
It also doesn‚Äôt help that typically, most people who get the promotions within my work place tend to be suck ups or close with management, only to then be sacked or demoted months later while I‚Äôm told to just keep applying. It gets exhausting and makes any potentially genuine praise from said management feel like another lie or an attempt to just get more applicants to look better to their management. 

Meanwhile, I see new programs and apprenticeships being offered to the new generations that weren‚Äôt previously there for mine, which makes me feel like we‚Äôve been left out of opportunities simply by being here too early. (Maybe I‚Äôm wrong or just being biased here?)

Next, let‚Äôs move onto the dating scene. Dating apps are as helpful as talking to a brick wall. Bumble, tinder, hinge, Facebook dating. Next to no matches even when asking and taking advice for profiles, conversations that end up leaving me blocked just by saying hi, trying to start a conversation, or the latest one, talking about tea. If I was like the creepier type of people on those platforms sending inappropriate pictures, requests, etc etc, then I‚Äôd get it. But to be blocked after talking about tea was not on my bingo card for 2025. 

People suggest going to clubs, pubs and raves, something I‚Äôm not too comfortable with (the only exception for me is concerts as I‚Äôm a massive music fan and make music as well). While getting out your comfort zone is a good suggestion, I feel like those places would put me on edge or I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable around the type of people who go. (It‚Äôs more just personal taste, though I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of lovely people who enjoy it). Being an introverted person who doesn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt a big circle of people around me also makes it more isolating.
Oh, and add a sprinkle of messages from people who try to flirt online before sending onlyfans links to get money out of you. 
It‚Äôs a solid combination to knock your confidence down in trying to date, especially with only having experience from high school (so 10 years ago).

What makes the above more difficult to digest isn‚Äôt the wasted effort in trying to get a decent job or find a partner, but the success of people I knew back in school and college, along with the ones around me at work. Promotions, success, and relationships/marriage/families that seemed to have worked out amazingly well by there mid 20‚Äôs make me feel out of place sometimes.
Being able to move out and have independence is almost an impossible dream, due to low income and the average cost of renting+bills being a minimum of ¬£1.1k a month in my area for a decent place. Unless you‚Äôre looking for literally a single room to live in for a solid ¬£500. 

Now there‚Äôs some struggles that I understand why things haven‚Äôt changed. First of all, the music I make is a niche genre and isn‚Äôt consistent with what‚Äôs typically expected from an artist. 
I also expect that there are going to be people more capable and experienced in jobs I apply for. It‚Äôs a competitive market, sh*t sucks. But I don‚Äôt expect it to suck that hard for even basic level jobs.

So I want to ask, is there people who feel like they‚Äôre in the same situation? Or any advice that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgo out to clubs and raves‚Äù or something actually constructive and doable?
Or am I just going in with the completely wrong mentality, and I should just ‚Äúphase it out‚Äù and suck it up?

I ditched the YouTube app, but there weren‚Äôt many good alternative ways to watch YouTube since I use an iPhone. However, I found a really good solution that works for me and I‚Äôm surprised no one is talking about it.

I downloaded a browser called Brave and it has changed everything for me. It‚Äôs like Premium, but free. Brave has an automatic Adblock so you will never get a single ad. I also like to listen to music on YouTube, but the YouTube app wants the user to get Premium to listen to videos while the phone screen is off. That‚Äôs such a ripoff! I just go to YouTube on Brave and fullscreen the video. Once I‚Äôm in fullscreen I swipe up to exit the browser and the video continues to play. Once you are in that place you can turn off your phone screen and the audio will continue to play.

tl;dr If you use an iPhone download the Brave browser (the logo is an orange lion) and you can watch YouTube with no ads on it. You can also listen to the video‚Äôs audio while the phone screen is off."

The 2007 Honda Accord ($2500 - 196000 miles)

You want a car that gets the job done, that‚Äôll never leave you stranded, and that nobody will ever compliment you on? Well no look further, the 2007 Honda Accord.

Let‚Äôs talk features,
Aux Cord? Nope.
Bluetooth? Nope.
Fancy wheels? Nope.
Rear-view camera? Nope, but it has a transparent rear window and you have a neck that can fucking turn.

Let me tell you a story about this car. One day the service engine light came on, I didn‚Äôt give a shit and ignored it, it went away. I haven‚Äôt seen it since. The end. 

You can take the engine out of this car, drop it off the golden state bridge, fish it out of the water 1000 years later, put it in the trunk of the car, fill the gas tank with Nutella, turn the key and this puppy will start right the fuck up. 

This car will outlive you, it will outlive your children.

Interesting facts about this car:
     ‚Ä¢ In the owners manual, oil is listed as ‚Äúoptional‚Äù 
* The car‚Äôs name is Goldilocks and she REFUSES to be called anything else.
* This car will not take your shit.
* One time a Semi rear-ended my car. The Honda survived, the Semi didn‚Äôt. 

Wanna know more? Great, I have Goldilocks fill out a survey!

Relationship status: Divorced
Children: 3
Favorite song: ‚ÄúI wanna dance with somebody‚Äù by Whitney Houston
Favorite food: Grilled Chicken (she‚Äôs watching her figure)

This car is as practical as a Roth IRA, it is as middle of the road as your grandpa during his last silver alert, it‚Äôs as utilitarian as a member of a church whose scripture is based entirely on water bills. 

When I ran the CarFax on this car, I received a single piece of paper that said ‚Äúit‚Äôs an Accord, it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs face the facts, this car isn‚Äôt going to win any beauty contests but neither are you. Stop lying to yourself and stop lying to your wife. This isn‚Äôt the car you want, it‚Äôs the car you deserve. The 2007 Honda Accord. "

amitheasshole,"AITA for snapping at my mother when she asked when I would ""finally"" kick out my daughter?",4611,2025-04-03 14:44:29,345,"Hi, I am fairly new to using reddit, but I have lurked on some subreddits before (including this one). Anyway, on to my problem. 

I, 66f, am retired but kept very busy by caring for my mother (85f) and my disabled husband (64m). My mother does not live with us; she lives in an assisted living facility, where I visit her every few days to check up on her and see if she needs anything. During my latest visit, she brought up how I should ""finally"" kick out my daughter (29f, let's call her C).

Now for some context, yes, my daughter does indeed still live with me and my husband, for many factors including her rather fragile mental health, but what my mother does not understand is that, despite us being parent and child, we are not living in a parent and child kind of situation. We are roommates that just happen to also be family, because neither her nor my husband and I could afford places of our own in this economy. We are dependent on C just as much as she is dependent on us. 

C holds down a full time job, which doesn't pay great, but not awfully either. She pays her fair share in rent, utilities and groceries, does her fair share of chores and sometimes even takes over some of my chores when she feels that I need a break. I cook on weekdays when C has to work, but C has weekends off so she takes over cooking duties then. She has a savings account for emergencies, she pays for the family Netflix account, and even spends some of the fun money she has left over every month (which isn't much) on little treats for my husband and me, no matter how often I ask her not to waste what little money she has to enjoy life on us.



So with all of that as background, my mother's comments made me pretty angry, because C does so much to not be a burden to my husband and me, despite me telling her that I love her and could never see her as a burden. I also fear my mother may have planted that thought in her head when I wasn't around. Meanwhile, all my mother seems to do is demand, demand, demand. She has nurses at her disposal in that assisted living facility, and people who do grocery runs for her. But she never uses these services and demands that I do everything for her instead. She demands all of my time, energy and attention. I suspect she may want to push me to kick C out so she could move in with my husband and I and force me to be her full-time caretaker.

I was already having a shitty day, so I just snapped and told her that C's living situation is none of her damn business. She started crying and asked why I would yell at her for just being concerned.

So Reddit, AITA for snapping at my mother?"
amitheasshole,AITAH because my SIL is being ignored for lying about me making fun of her miscarriage,1022,2025-04-03 22:21:35,90,"I (29F) have a 5-year-old son. My SIL (34) has struggled with conceiving and lost a baby last year at 3 months.

Last Saturday, we had a BBQ, and she kept criticizing my parenting. When my son wanted to swim, I told him he needed sunscreen first, but she said it wasn‚Äôt necessary because he‚Äôs Black. I told her skin cancer doesn‚Äôt discriminate.

Then she commented on how I cut his grapes, insisting he could chew fine. She even looked up recommendations online, but I told her just because it says ‚Äúunder 5‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean I have to stop immediately.

After two hours of this, I snapped when she said he shouldn‚Äôt have cake because it would rot his teeth. I told her he has treats in moderation, brushes, flosses, and I even go over his teeth myself. She scoffed and went outside.

Later, when I went to grab patio pillows, I overheard her saying I‚Äôm a bad mom and she would be a better one. I lost it. I told her, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not his mom, so stop telling me how to parent. He‚Äôs loved, cared for, and all his needs are met. If you don‚Äôt like that I put sunscreen on my kid, don‚Äôt come around us anymore.‚Äù I was exhausted and sent everyone home.

That night, my MIL called, accusing me of being insensitive about SIL‚Äôs loss. SIL was telling people I said she‚Äôd never be a mom and mocked her miscarriage‚Äîsomething I would never say. I texted SIL, told her I wanted no further contact since she could lie so easily, removed myself from the family group chat, and blocked her.

My husband defended me, sending video surveillance of what I actually said. Now I‚Äôm getting apology texts, while SIL‚Äôs family is ignoring her. I also saw messages where she called me ‚Äúan outsider who shouldn‚Äôt be here in the first place,‚Äù which I think is about me being Black.

Some people are telling me I should have Just sat through it because she had a miscarriage. "
amitheasshole,AITA If I (29F) Tell My Husband (31M) I'm not Willing to Spend $10k on a Down Payment for a New Truck Because Driving My Car Makes Him Feel 'Less of a Man'?,1363,2025-04-03 20:17:20,381,"Edit to clarify title- we are looking at USED trucks. Said new as the truck would be new to us. Doesn‚Äôt change point of post much but wanted to be accurate.

Backstory - my husband and I got married last July but we've been together for a total of 7.5 years. We've always kept our finances separate but I've been wanting to merge accounts for a while to remove that feeling of ""his and my"" money and approach our finances as a team rather than two individuals. If it matters, he makes about $15-20k more a year than I do, but I have the most money in my savings account.

Long story short, his car has a lot of problems and he's been wanting a truck for a while. Logically, we really do need a truck to allow us to do more home renovations and be less reliant on family, but I'm not sure now is the right time. 

I've asked him if we can set a goal to purchase a truck this summer so we can focus on saving up for a good down payment to lower our monthly payments and so we can remain secure with a ""nest egg"" in our bank account. I currently have $13k in my account - this includes both my savings and my checking account. He has anywhere from $5k-7k in his account typically. While I've kept my spending more frugal, he has, to be fair, spent more money on our home and daily needs as I work remote whereas he works in person so it's easier for him to grab last minute items throughout the week. 

I want to make sure I am not making him look like he's being selfish, that's not the case, but I do think he is being immature. He asked me if we can go look at a $39k truck this weekend and is asking me to put $10k down. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not hoarding my money from him, but I grew up homeless, without basic needs, and I do not ever want to put myself into a position where I am struggling again. We are 100% not poor but I would feel very insecure dropping my account down by that much when I've been saving this money for YEARS. To add to the conflict, when I remind him we don't *need* the truck this minute and that we can use my car until say August/September, he says driving my car makes him feel like he's not a man. 

I tried to tell him that there's nothing manlier than a man who puts his families financial interests before his wants, but he just clams up. He essentially told me that I obviously don't think of my bank account as ours and what I say is apparently the final say. 

I've tried to have a mature conversation to weigh the pros and cons but he is legitimately pouting. I'm talking no eye contact, mono-syllable responses, and not engaging in the discussion. I don't want to have him feeling like his wants aren't valid, but how do I get him to see from my perspective? Or if necessary, how do I see from his when he won't give me anything more than ""It's the only truck that meets our requirements within 500 sq miles, you have more money than I do, and your car is a chicks car""?

  
TLDR - my husband wants me to drop my bank account down to $3k so he can have a manly vehicle. "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to take care of my husband's medical equipment,4377,2025-04-03 11:33:24,1520,"So my husband (42m) and I (41f) are having a disagreement. 
Here's the situation: he uses a CPAP machine at night. He's had it for 15 years and never puts it away in the morning. He has decided that it's my responsibility to take care of it and prevent the children or our pets from touching it. He says it's unreasonable for him to put it away every morning, even though there are many many things the kids and I use and put away every single day. He insists that other things of his be left where it's convenient for himself even if it makes life harder for the rest of us (example he will leave his shoes under the kitchen table and tells me that I should just not clean the floor there at all so his shoes don't get moved) he goes to great lengths to make life easier for himself even if that means putting more difficulty on me and our children. 

 last night our cat got into our bedroom and chewed on the hose for his CPAP. I didn't know it till we went to bed and husband freaked out. He demanded to know why I wasn't watching his CPAP and why I had ""let"" it get ruined. Then he decided he wants to lock me and the kids out of our bedroom when he leaves for work every morning. I said absolutely not. Our second bathroom is only accessible thru the bedroom, all my own things are in the bedroom and that would leave me with out access to any of my things during the day unless I cleared everything out of my room and the second bathroom (which is also where I keep my makeup and other personal items) which to me seems totally unreasonable 
I told him he should put away his CPAP every morning. 
He says that it's unreasonable for him to remember to do such an annoying task and that he shouldn't have to put anything he owns away

I really feel like he should be responsible for his own things and that it is unreasonable for him to lock me out of my own room.

So am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not opening a chest to ease my roommates fears,1306,2025-04-03 16:36:37,341,"Recently we had to move some important stuff out of our family storage because of a rat chewing things up. I brought home a large chest full of family scrapbooks and pictures. It looks like an old timey pirate treasure chest with a cartoonishly large padlock. 
 
One of my roommates noticed it and asked to look inside. I told him what is was but didn‚Äôt have the key to open it. He then asked if I could break the lock so he could conform with his own eyes. I said no because it wasn‚Äôt mine to break and my family liked the charm of the lock. He got upset and insisted I either show him what‚Äôs inside or get it out the house. He‚Äôs worried there might be a weapon inside, for context he has trauma from any sort of  weapon. 

I tried assuring him there was nothing like that inside but he kept insisting I open it. I would take it out the house but i don‚Äôt want my parents to have to lug this over 100 pound chest up the stairs and no one can put their hands on the key My other roommate says I should just open it to give him peace of mind AITA because I don‚Äôt want to open it.

amitheasshole,AITA for not covering my friend's meal when she ordered more?,9899,2025-04-03 06:28:30,556,"So me and a group of friends went out to eat after midterm. It was a casual places where you pay at the end, and everyone was ordering whatever they wanted.

I got something small as usual because I‚Äôm trying to save some cash. So I had water and a basic pasta that was on special. A few others did the same. But one of my friend ordered a appetizer, a big entr√©e, and dessert, and she got a drink too. No judgment, she can do her, but it definitely added up.

When the check came, she suddenly goes, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just split it evenly.‚Äù I was like, what? I thought we were all paying for what we ordered. She said it would be easier and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat we always do,‚Äù which is not true by the way.

I told her I only brought enough for what I ate, plus a tip. She rolled her eyes and said it‚Äôs not that deep, and that I‚Äôm being cheap over a few bucks. But it wasn‚Äôt a few bucks. It would have almost doubled what I was planning to spend.

I didn‚Äôt budge and paid for my stuff only. My other friends didn't care and split the bill evenly.  Now she‚Äôs being super passive and told our other friend that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and made her look greedy. But like, she assumed we‚Äôd cover part of her extra food without even asking. 

AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for calling the police on my roommate after they broke into my room?,2559,2025-04-03 12:21:43,228,"So, I (22F) live with two roommates (one 22F, the other 23F), and we've had some tension lately. I‚Äôve always been a private person, so I make it a point to keep my room door closed when I'm not there. The trouble started a few weeks ago when one of my roommates, let's call her Rachel, started borrowing my things without asking. I don‚Äôt mind sharing occasionally, but Rachel would take stuff without telling me, and when I confronted her about it, she‚Äôd either deny it or get defensive.

After a couple of weeks of this, I decided to check with our landlord to make sure it was okay to put a lock on my bedroom door. He said it was fine as long as it wasn‚Äôt an issue with the door frame, so I went ahead and installed it. I felt like it was the only way to keep my things safe, especially after I noticed some of my personal items were moved or misplaced.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I came home from work and noticed that the door to my room was wide open. Immediately, I got this sinking feeling. My laptop, which I had left on my desk, was missing, as well as my Nintendo switch. I called Rachel and my other roommate, and asked if they had been in my room. Rachel acted surprised but also defensive, and the just seemed concerned, asking if everything was okay.

I was furious. I knew that the only way my door would be open was if someone had broken in, and at this point, I was pretty sure I knew who it was. I went into my room and searched for my laptop and switch, but they were gone. After some back-and-forth with Rachel, I realised that she had taken them without permission. When I confronted her, she admitted to borrowing them for ‚Äúa few days‚Äù but didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal.

At that point, I was beyond frustrated. I told Rachel that I didn‚Äôt appreciate her violating my privacy, and I was done trying to sort things out on my own. I called the police to report that my property had been stolen and that I felt unsafe in my own home.

The police showed up, and after hearing my side of things and talking to Rachel, they advised her to return the laptop and switch and apologised for the inconvenience. The laptop was returned but the switch wasn‚Äôt, and she claimed that she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know I owned a switch.‚Äù She seemed to think I was overreacting, and some of my friends have also been saying that I might have taken things too far by involving the cops.

Now, I'm feeling conflicted. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect things to escalate this much, but I felt like I had no choice. I‚Äôm just so tired of being taken advantage of in my own home. But at the same time, I feel bad because now things are super awkward with Rachel, and the police involvement might have been too dramatic.

So, AITA for calling the police on my roommate after she went into my room without permission and took my devices?"
amitheasshole,AITA for making a comment about my friend not having a job after she expected us to bye her food.,2078,2025-04-03 11:16:24,249,"Awhile ago, I was in the car with some friends, and we were all driving to an art store. One of my friends (let‚Äôs call her Anna) mentioned she was hungry. Her boyfriend was in the back seat with her, and they started talking about what to eat.

For context, we are all adults, but Anna doesn‚Äôt work and doesn‚Äôt like spending her boyfriend‚Äôs money. We suggested a pizza place, but she said, ""Well, I don‚Äôt mind eating off your plates."" Without really thinking, I responded, ""Of course you don‚Äôt.""

The car got quiet after that. We ended up skipping food and just went to the art store, but Anna stayed in the car, pouting. Later, she got upset with me, saying I made her feel bad for not having a job. Her boyfriend also told me I shouldn‚Äôt have said that.

For context, Anna can work but has chosen not to. I didn‚Äôt mean to make her feel bad, but I also felt like it was an awkward comment for her to make in the first place. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I was out of line.

AITA?

Edit for context: She‚Äôs not really a friend anymore, just my ex‚Äôs sister and my daughter‚Äôs aunt. When this happened, I was living with my ex and his family‚Äîseven people total. At the time, only her boyfriend and I were working. My ex was doing college work and getting paid for it, while his parents (both ex-military and 100% disabled) lived off their benefits. Anna had tried to file for disability but was denied, yet still refused to work or help out around the house.

I don‚Äôt live with them anymore, but I do have anxiety and am on the spectrum, so I struggle with social cues sometimes. My brain just resurfaced this memory, and I started feeling bad about it again. I wanted to know if I was actually in the wrong or if I was overthinking it."
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my coworker interrupt me anymore?,763,2025-04-03 16:03:10,122,"I've been at my job for 3 years now and in personal and professional conversation, my worker continually interrupts me. Not just me, it's everyone. Usually, someone will start to speak and after about 2 seconds, he will interrupt. Not always about the same subject, sometimes he will just spark into a completely different topic. There's professional conversations that have to happen and we literally sit next to each other. Always thought that's just how his brain works or he's got a different communication style...

  
Recently, I started just literally talking louder and not stopping when he interrupts. It usually leads to both of us talking for 1-2 seconds... sometimes he will stop/slow-down and sometimes he just keeps going almost ignoring what I'm saying. I feel crazy and I feel like everyone else at work notices. I asked him to just stop interrupting me but when I brought this up to a friend, they said that's an asshole move (didn't work btw). Am I an asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not wanted to see GF family with bad hygiene?,696,2025-04-03 16:29:09,71,"I (29m) do not want to be around my gf's (28F) extended family.  They are nice people, but get sick very often, and have a habit of touching food with their hands when serving.  The last few times I went I got sick, because one of the members had a fever and still showed up.  Last time specifically, one of the older family members was recovering from a cold, and my gf didn't tell me, and when I got there he looked visibly sick.  She then said ""how are you feeling"", which clued me in that she already knew he was sick.  I couldn't leave immediately, the room was small and crowded, and of course I got sick.  The grandparents who come are also very old, in their 90s.  I do not want to show up anymore because I cannot afford to be sick for a week every time we hang out, and I think they are eventually going to kill the grandparents.  I don't want to be the guy that says I'm never going to family gatherings though as it puts my GF in a  weird spot after dating for 7 years.  At this point though, I've pretty much decided I'm not doing dinners with the extended family.  AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not telling the sub how to pronounce my name?,324,2025-04-03 20:10:17,413,"We had a substitute teacher today, and while taking attendance, she asked if she was pronouncing my name correctly. I told her she could pronounce it however she wanted‚Äînot to be rude, but because I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to say it myself. I have an ethnic name, but no one, not even my family, calls me by it. I was given an alias since I was three years old. Despite that, I was called disrespectful and sent out of class. ü´°

Edit to clarify:

I did tell her my alias. Conversation went like

Sub : ""Name. Is that how you pronounce it?""

Me: ""Yes. You can pronounce it however you want.""

Sub: ""Ok. How do you pronounce it?""

Me: ""I'm not sure. I don't go by that name and no one in my class calls me by it either.""

Sub: ""What?""

Me: ""I go by [Alias]. ""

Sub: ""But what's on the paper is [ N A M E]. ""

silence.. 

Sub: ""You can leave for being disrespectful.""


Edit 2:

I only included the part where she could pronounce it however BECAUSE she was going around, asking anyone with a difficult to pronounce name how to pronounce it. I said it to be accommodating. But I can see how it could come off as otherwise. 

Edit 3:
Probably my last edit and last time I'm responding to comments. Thanks for all the advice. It's noted. Have a wonderful day and thanks for your time! "
amitheasshole,AITA for not financially supporting my husband's parents?,312,2025-04-03 17:18:10,97,"About 1.5yrs ago my (33F) husband's (32m) three siblings decided they were each going to give $100/mo to their parents (66F and lower 60sM). My husband lost his job last May and stopped contributing the $100, and his unemployment payments ran out in December. We have been living off of my salary and he donates plasma, we share money and discuss all expenses but I have the final financial say (it was that way before as well, because I'm very good with money and he prefers me to take care of it). He was making about the same as me before so we've had to adjust our lifestyle a ton with our income being cut in half, but there are some fun things we still do, like we still travel occasionally because we have points for flights and we stay with friends for free.

Last night he got called to a family meeting where he found out his dad is leaving his mom, this has happened before a few times and they worked it out but this time it seems final. They own their house fully and his dad said he would be willing to sign it away to MIL for $25k, the house is worth a lot now as it's in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood so this is wayyyy less than his half would be if they sold it. 

My husband and his siblings got dinner after to discuss the situation and how they were going to help their mom, and during that conversation they got onto him about not contributing the monthly $100. They said it was a bad look that we are still going on trips. He explained that they are very cheap trips because we don't pay for flights or lodging and said he has no income. They basically said it should come out of my income then since we're a household.

He asked me if we could contribute the monthly $100 and I said not until he has a job and we stabilize. We squeak by but we are not in any position to have another monthly bill. He understood, as he always does.

Some additional context, my MIL is a lovely person and I also get along super well with his siblings. There is a bit of a cultural difference at play here, because I come from a culture where parents would rather die than take money from their children and in his culture it's common for children to financially support their parents. I love my MIL but I don't feel great knowing that we are her retirement plan to be honest, especially since we plan to have kids of our own soon and I would also like us to retire someday. It's $100 a month now but I know this monthly amount isn't going to be the end of it and it doesn't quite sit right with me, even outside of our current financial situation, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

TL;DR: Husband doesn't have a job. His siblings want us to continue give their mom $100 a month like we used to for both parents because we still travel and I told him we can't until he has a job.

I genuinely want to know the truth because I'm feeling weird about the whole thing, AITA for being the reason we are not currently contributing $100 a month to my in-law(s)?

EDIT: To address some frequent questions/points:

-It's pretty clear they do not plan on supporting their dad financially, he has been crappy in the way he has treated their mom so as far as I know, the monthly support in the future would be going to just mom.

-Mom plans to take out a loan for the 25k. Dad is asking for it in exchange for signing his rights away. The best solution would definitely be to pay the 25k first and get it in her name, and then sell the house and she gets all the proceeds. If she kept it the house would be later inherited by him and his siblings, but it makes more sense to all of them (and me) for mom to have the money while she's alive. But she does not seem to want to sell the house. We'll see what happens.

-Mom works at a chain tax-prep place, dad doesn't work. They are not disabled.

-The money started because sister found out parents got food from a food bank

-Husband absolutely does need to get a job, he has had some good interviews lately so hopefully he hears something positive back"
amitheasshole,AITA for reacting in anger to my brother telling me he will not attend my wedding?,491,2025-04-03 14:04:01,159,"My (m35) brother (m24) called me 2 days before my wedding and informed me that he would not be attending.

Background: my fianc√©e and I have been planning this wedding for over a year, and my brother is one of the first people we invited. He is part of the bridal/groom party. Our parents will not be attending, but I expected that, as it is a secular wedding, and they are pretty hardcore legalist Protestant Christians, and anything not revolving around God, or including alcohol or non-Christian music is considered sinful. My brother would have been the only part of my nuclear family to attend, and that is important to me. We are the only two siblings. 

Lately, he's been financially underwater, due to some questionable decisions he made in the past (financed a truck he couldn't afford primarily), as well as suffers from anxiety. 

He called me yesterday evening, 2 days before our wedding, and informed me he would not be going. He cited that he does not do well in crowds, and barely knows anyone there, and that he'd be unable to attend, since his anxiety would be too much to handle. He also cited, that even if he did attempt to attend, his truck would be repossessed the day of our wedding. I told him I'd pick him up, and that there were multiple members of our extended family attending, to which he replied that he didn't really know those people. 

I then reacted in near-rage, telling him to f*** off and not contact me again, and hung up. A few minutes later I called to apologize, but the call went to voicemail. I followed up with texts apologizing, but telling him to get help for his anxiety, and that I would need time for our relationship to bounce back from this. 

AITA for chewing him out, and for being irate at his reasoning to not attend my wedding? I feel like I overreacted to the situation. I've also been told I reacted accordingly, as in our cultures (Central American and US-American), weddings are a massive deal in our lives and not to be taken lightly. 

EDIT: I myself suffer from Bipolar II Disorder with anxiety, so for those wondering if I am unable to understand what he's feeling, I certainly do; however, through professional help, I've managed to find ways to manage it. Him and I have bonded over me helping him with tips to manage anxiety that I've received from my therapists. 

EDIT II: I failed to mention, in between him informing me of his reasoning for not coming, and me boiling over and shouting at him, I handed the phone to my fiancee, who was calmer than me (who was feeling frustration and anxiety) to speak and plead with him to come, and he gave her all the same reasons, telling her that if we ""did not understand, then sorry but I can't come,"" which was when I took the phone back and had the anger outburst. Unsure if this helps at all, but felt that it was important to the series of events. 

EDIT III: For those urging me to seek help for anger management, this is a complete one-off outburst. I'm very level-headed, and this type of occurrence is very rare. I rarely let the anger side of the feelings wheel take hold, and even in the rare occurrence they do, it's tempered frustration at best, and not for long. "
amitheasshole,AITA for canceling all reservations for a group trip,185,2025-04-03 19:00:16,78,"This weekend I (20F) and two of my friends were supposed to be going out of town to celebrate my 21st birthday. Since I‚Äôm not a huge drinker we decided to go to a concert instead. For more context me and the two friends all work for the same hospitality group and we made reservations at only restaurants that were owned by the same company, but they book up really quickly for weekends and are difficult to get into as a walk in. Monday night the friend that had agreed to drive texted me asking if I would be able to leave at 9am and I said I would not since I have class that ends at 9:50 that day. This is met with a response saying that I would then have to drive separately. Which I had no intention of doing simply because of the mileage. (I drove us to our spring break trip which was 1600 miles round trip) i asked why the time of departure couldn‚Äôt be delayed and it was because the friend who was driving had planned a meeting at headquarters of the company we work for in hopes of an internship and they needed to be there before 2 that afternoon. Upon hearing this I said maybe it‚Äôs best I sit this trip out since I won‚Äôt be able to drive separately nor did I want my friend to miss out on this opportunity since it was important to them. I had no problem staying home. But after I said that my friend started telling me how all I do is judge her and be negative towards everything she does and how inconvenient this is with the trip being on my birthday weekend but she really needs the internship and how she thinks it‚Äôs time for us to go separate ways. In none of my messages to her was I being rude or trying to judge her for anything but her responding that way threw me off so I just told her I agree and left it at that. After I sold the concert tickets and canceled all the reservations. If someone who I thought was my friend decided to end a friendship of 6 years because of me letting them continue with a trip I had planned then I can only help by getting rid of all distraction so they can fully focus on the meeting.
So AITA for doing all of that or should I have allowed them to continue with the plan that had been set for this trip?"
amitheasshole,AITA for nagging my wife about laundry,59,2025-04-04 00:12:05,135,"Okay this is a silly, shallow little one, but my wife (37) encouraged me (f/34) to ask the aitah crew.

Basically: AITAH for trying to get my wife to cool it on burning through so much laundry!

My wife goes through a LOT of laundry. She dresses very casual, we work from home and can wear anything and we don't have anything requiring special uniforms or outfits. I wear an outfit a day and maybe some PJs if I don't just sleep in underwear.

She changes 1-3 times minimum per day. She wakes up, puts on an outfit, starts her day. If she has errands she'll change again. Then in the evening she may change before a dog walk or something. It can honestly even be another shirt or two on some days. 

We do laundry 2x per week at least and this last load, I folded fifteen of her tshirts from about 4 days. 

She thinks she's the norm, and I think that's crazy. 

I mostly do laundry because she does a lot of other things around the house and it takes her like 2 days to finish one load (remembering to swap it over, folding it and finally putting it away). I actually like laundry as a chore, but once a week maybe. Doing laundry every 3-4 days and folding a couple of my outfits while I fold her entire wardrobe just flabbergasts me. And hydro isn't cheap where we live.

Okay, want your thoughts - AITAH? How many clothes are y'all realistically going through in your regular adult life? 


Final note: I love my wife, and I think monitoring someone's clothing usage is of course ridiculous, but when it's so blatantly over the top I can't help but notice and complain.

(My wife thinks I wrote this to appeal to more women who will side with me and insists I add that in hahah)"
amitheasshole,AITA my husband has been subtly insulting things I do and I fired back by saying things about his past,95,2025-04-03 20:47:30,38,"So my husband and I have been having some issues and I have to admit we have a toxic dynamic. We aren't perfect and tend to be reactive people. Lately this week we have been fighting a lot. Let me start with the first incident.

Incident 1: We were having a good day texting each other. Once he got home, I was playing some music from my discover weekly Spotify playlist the whole time. He told me that he was going to have a zoom meeting with his friend over some homework help. I was cool and was doing my own thing by tidying up the house and taking care of our baby. My playlist then started playing girl music like Sabrina Carpenter and alike. He asked me to change the music but I was in the middle of feeding our baby and told him I couldn't because my hands were full. Told him he is welcome to change it instead. He didn't and I forgot about it and continued to do things. Later on, he was upset because I ""disrespected"" him. That I was playing ""whore"" music while he was on a meeting with his friend. He accused me of having a bad attitude and refusing to change it. 

Incident 2: He got home the next day and I was in the middle of watching that new movie The Life List. I told him it was a drama movie that he probably wouldn't like and started explaining the whole plot to him. Spoiler.... Sorry guys...I told my husband that in the movie the female leads mom cheated on her dad and got pregnant. Then I said it was shitty because her mom is actually pretty cool. He started hating on the mom and told me that she was my ""role model"". (In the past I was unfaithful to one of my boyfriends, but not my husband) Yeah it sucked to be told those things. He told me I watched a bunch of movies with adultery on them. 

Incident 3: He got home the next day, and he was helping me cook dinner while I was taking care of our baby. I was reading a book, a smut book to be specific. I told him about it and shared a page with him. I said the whole plot is usually corny and predictable but the spicy scenes are good. He read it and got upset that I don't let him do these things and he has been sour about it. He was hating on me for idolizing things like this. That was hit a nerve.

After everything, I became very angry. Because it feels like I been constantly attaked by him. My husband back in the day used to be a big fuck boy. He would brag about sleeping with a lot of women and having threesomes even arranging gangbangs with his military friends. I knew of all this so I started attacking him over his past and said hurtful things about it. Told him that he idolizes that behavior maybe he should go back to that. 

It was immature of my part to attack him on things he did before he met me. But his attitude and comments have been hurtful. I am tired of being accused of being the one who is the problem here. I don't know how to move on from this. There is a lot to unpack here. Sorry for such a long confusing post. There is not enough words to describe what is going on here."
amitheasshole,AITA for not willing to split the cost of a group gift when I wasn‚Äôt included in the card,899,2025-04-03 06:45:48,99,"One of my friends got a new job recenly and some my friends decided to get her a little gift. I was in the group chat where it got brought up, but I was super busy with studying and didn‚Äôt say much. A couple people were throwing around ideas and I figured they‚Äôd update us later.

Well, last weekend they gave her the gift which is a airpod pro and posted a little photo of her holding it with a card. I didn‚Äôt even know they picked something already. I also wasn‚Äôt asked to sign the card or even told when they were giving it to her.

Then that same night, one of the girls Venmo requested me $20 for my ‚Äúshare.‚Äù I asked what it was for and she said, ‚Äúthe gift, obviously,‚Äù like I should‚Äôve just known.

I told her I didn‚Äôt get to sign the card or even know what they picked, and she said it didn‚Äôt matter because I was part of the group and it‚Äôs just what we all agreed to. But like‚Ä¶ I never agreed. I dont think i was included. I wasn‚Äôt even asked...

After that they are saying I‚Äôm making it awkward and that it‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs about celebrating a friend, but I kinda feel like I was treated like an afterthought and still expected to pay.

amitheasshole,AITA for finding and confirming a new room to rent without notifying my housemates in advance,245,2025-04-03 13:50:05,40,"AITA for finding a room of my own without notifying in advance that I took it

I (28 F) am currently in a lease that is ending this April. The main tenants is a married couple in their 30s. We had been sharing an apartment for almost a year and at the end of February, we kicked out one of the other tenant as he due to hygienic and had been consuming a lot of electricity (After he left, the bill went from 75 each to 55 each) 

The issue is that due to the vacant room and our effortless search for a new tenant, us living in the apartment might not be feasible as I myself am in a very tight financial situation and can't afford to help pay for the vacant room. The landlord had been hussling us to find a new tenant for that room. 

For this, I had messaged the wife of the couple and she said to liase with her husband about it as she had a lot on her plate. 

For the whole of March, I had been sending links for potential units the three of us can share as we had thought it would be easier to move out together. A lot of my possible units were declined as they wanted to stay in the area while I was looking towards the East of the country as a lot of my work seem to be there lately. 

Everytime I saw the husband, I asked if there was any updates and the two of us shared our experiences finding a new unit. The latest I had heard from them is that the agent they had used to find this apartment had put the apartment up for lease again per the landlord's wishes. I was also told that he had been looking for a unit for him and his wife as well. 

For some reason, they expected me to wait until the later half of April to begin properly searching for a new place to live despite telling me that I should look for a backup. I'm already anxious about possibly being homeless in May and just 2 days ago I finally found a place that is cheaper and fits everything I needed to rent. 

Today, I messaged in our group chat telling them that I will be moving out in May as I had found a place and took the room. 

The wife got upset and told me that I should've been more considerate and honest about all of my room searching with them as they had just told the landlord that they would keep the apartment even though there was no other tenant in the other room and that they had been discussing it so much amongst the two of them and that they were being considerate about my financial situation and wished that I would be more considerate to my future housemate. 

I was stunned as I had openly told her husband about my searching, me wanting to find a cheaper place as well as find one in the east. There was no discussion from them about staying regardless and I couldn't afford paying more than I already am for rent. I had no clue but I had already taken up an offer for another place. 

I feel bad cause I should've told them about it before confirming the new room so that they didn't tell the landlord that they would stay on with the lease

So AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for offering my clothes to a coworker after losing weight?,6968,2025-04-02 19:09:12,528,"I have a coworker that I am very close to and we eat lunch together, etc. I‚Äôm a clothes horse and I have so many things that I‚Äôve never worn and still have the tags on. My coworker is always commenting to me that she loves my clothes and if I ever decide to give anything away, please come to her first!  We were the same size. 

I recently lost a lot of weight and I‚Äôve gone down five sizes. I‚Äôve been working really hard at it, but I haven‚Äôt been talking about it that much because it seems to be a bit of tension between the two of us. She‚Äôs never said anything outright, just some passive aggressive comments about how I‚Äôm getting too thin. I just ignore it because a lot of people say that, and I think it‚Äôs just a result of the shock of me losing weight. I still have about 30 pounds to lose before I even hit the 150 mark and I‚Äôm very short. I‚Äôm definitely not too thin and I still suffer from body dysmorphia, so I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm thin at all. 

I recently went through my clothes, and I have a shocking amount of things that have either never been worn or have been worn once (I really need to work on this addiction). I put them together in boxes and on my next trip into the office, I asked her if she would like me to bring those in so she could go through them. Her face took on this very shocked expression, and then she said ‚Äúwhy would you ask me that? Why would you insult me by asking me if I want your hand me downs and castoffs? That‚Äôs so humiliating.‚Äù  I was stunned and I think I might‚Äôve actually said I was sorry and walked away.   

To make things even worse, there‚Äôs another friend in the office who was also my size, and as we went out to the car later that day she asked me what the boxes were in my car. I told her they were my larger size clothes and that I had brought them for our other coworker, but she didn‚Äôt want them (I didn‚Äôt go into any details).  She went nuts and asked if she could go through the box. She called her daughter who worked very close by and we spent the next 45 minutes going through the boxes and getting the stuff that she wanted. They literally took almost everything. While they were doing it, the other coworker came outside to leave for the day and saw what was happening. She got into her car and left.  Later that night she texted me and lit into me about me giving the clothes to the other coworker.  

I am so confused. Did I insult her? And if I did, why would she care if I gave the clothes to someone else? After several years of a good work friendship, she won‚Äôt even speak to me anymore. Am I the asshole? 

EDIT:  Just as an FYI, we have been friends and coworkers for six years. I have been giving her clothes off and on for those six years. Some of the comments suggested that I put this in the original post. During those six years, I have lost 10 or 15 pounds and given her some of those clothes during that time and she didn‚Äôt seem offended. I‚Äôm now down 65 pounds.  "
amitheasshole,AITA for not staying overnight at the hospital with our 7 year old son along with my extra wife?,4330,2025-04-02 19:48:05,330,"Our son has a bad case of pneumonia requiring a surgical procedure to drain fluid from his chest and now he has a chest tube. The infection is pretty bad, we‚Äôve been here about 8 days and he is finally starting to turn a corner. The fevers are less frequent and not as high. 

I have been here everyday and will continue to do so. His mom, my ex wife, is also here but during the day she‚Äôs working (remotely) and a little more distracted. 

A couple days ago, with our son showing some progress, I decided to leave for the night so I can get some rest. His mom will leave for about 3 hours in the late afternoon/evening to shower, change, do whatever, and when she returns I leave. At that time our son is getting ready to sleep or is sleeping. 

I return first thing in the morning, between 6 and 6:30am to make sure I am here for the Dr. rounds or any early morning procedure such as labs or X-rays. 

Full transparency, my girlfriend lives near by and I go to her house to shower, change, and get some rest in a real bed. 

I‚Äôve offered my son‚Äôs mom the same opportunity, I‚Äôve told her that if she wanted to go home for the night I am more than happy to stay. However, she refuses and today when I made the same offer she said no, she‚Äôs going to stay with our son and doesn‚Äôt understand how any parent can leave their child at the hospital so they can go be with their partner. 

Apparently she can still get in my head because here I am asking if I am the asshole for leaving my son at the hospital with his mom, my ex wife, instead of staying the night. Should I also be staying if she‚Äôs here?

Keep in mind that she makes good money but she can‚Äôt manage her finances, she had filed for bankruptcy before I met her, we managed to get a house and cars based on my good credit. When it came the time for me to take a very important and very difficult professional exam, she felt like I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention to her and started cheating with one of her friends‚Äô husband! She left her email open one day and I saw the gruesome email exchange (I was already suspecting something)! Not only that but she was also pursuing two other men one of them was also married! I let her keep the house which we didn‚Äôt have tons of equity in it but I did pay half the mortgage on it for 5 years. However, I insisted we split her retirement account for which my half amounted to about 15k before tax. With that being said, I got my citizenship relatively fast thanks to that woman, I could‚Äôve gotten it through employment but that would‚Äôve been a longer more complicated route. This woman scarred me for life, she told me before marriage that she wanted children and that turned out to be a lie, I have struggled to maintain relationships ever since divorce.
I got a word recently that she filed for a second bankruptcy. With all the stuff currently going on with immigration I keep thinking that I owe her even though she dragged me through hell. I keep thinking about paying her back the 15k after accounting for inflation. Keep in mind that she‚Äôs a nurse practitioner and makes excellent money possibly more than me. What do you think the  correct course of action would be? There‚Äôs a good chance if I give her that money that she will blow it up on dumb stuff."

amitheasshole,AITA for ‚Äúspoiling‚Äù a family trip bc im unwilling to sleep on a blow up mattress for 2 weeks,1172,2025-04-03 00:57:26,421,"Where do I even begin?

My brother, sister in law and 18 month old niece live out of the country so its a big deal for them to finally come for a visit and rare that we all get to be together. My parents and SO live on the west coast and I live on the east coast. 

Anyway were are all planning on meeting for 2 weeks at my grandpa‚Äôs (RIP) old lake house that we grew up visiting. Its a super tiny lodge maybe 1000sqft MAX so surprriiissee theres only 2 bedrooms. Being the youngest I have been automatically delegated to the living room. Sleeping in there with all the cousins was fine when I was 14 but I am nearly 30 now and that damn pull out couch is 20 years older than me. Keep in mind that my fiance is coming AND meeting the family for the first time. I think she deserves to be comfortable and have some sense of privacy in a new environment. I have now mentioned to everyone that I won‚Äôt be sleeping there several times, which has been seemingly ignored and unsupported. As the youngest sibling I am not new to getting last pick but it pisses me off that this is extended into adulthood and being pushed onto my fiance.

Making it increasingly complicated is that the nearest airbnb (option 1) is a 25 minute drive and $2000usd for 5 nights. And the only RV to rent (option 2) within a 2 hour pickup is also close to $2000usd. All the nearby motels are booked up. The fact that we might not have wanted to sleep in the living room for 2 weeks was never really considered by anyone else.

My SO and I having to front this additional cost is hurtful enough let alone the rest of the family not caring or even acknowledging that we just want to have a room/decent bed. The best they have done to help resolve is help us get a tent and blow mattress for outside.

I have decided that I will go by myself and sleep in the living room for ~4 nights as that is the max amount of bad sleep I think I can handle. This solution apparently is ‚Äúruining the trip for everyone‚Äù and making it all about me, am I the asshole?

EDIT: the toddler is also sleeping in the living room because the 2nd bedroom has no extra space"
amitheasshole,AITA for not helping my grandma book a flight?,26,2025-04-03 21:30:06,49,"My grandma lives several states away from me and lives alone. She will occasionally text me asking for help over the phone, which I don‚Äôt mind. When she calls about tech issues, however, it‚Äôs frustrating to help her however because while in the process of trying to help my grandma calmly, she gets panicked easily and raises her voice, will start ranting about she‚Äôs bad at technology, will cut me off almost every time I‚Äôm speaking, and any time I ask simple questions can be as simple as yes or no, she over explains her answers for several minutes. Because of this, if she needs help with something simple like, say, turning her phone on silent mode, for example, it will take 30 minutes to an hour just due to the communication backlog.

Today my grandma needs help with a flight. Being a good grandson, I look up flights for her with all the details already filled for what she needs and send her the link so she can pay. The first option doesn‚Äôt work, she asks me to do it again, and I do. Then she says it doesn‚Äôt work because she can‚Äôt type everything out and can‚Äôt see.

At this point, I don‚Äôt know how to help her except* buying the ticket straight up for her, but I can‚Äôt do this because I simply can‚Äôt afford to drop a random 400$ right now. I tell her to call the airline and that they can assist her over the phone. She‚Äôs refusing and says she doesn‚Äôt want to wait on hold. I call the airline she‚Äôs trying to book with, and the hold times are ten minutes.

I tell her this and suggest she tries calling one more time. She hasn‚Äôt responded yet. I feel like a jerk but I also feel like if my grandma is this ‚Ä¶ unwound, from using technology she needs to start finding other ways around doing important things with it. "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my husband he needs to clean the toilets?,17,2025-04-03 23:45:47,36,"I (40f) am a SAHM, though I work part-time from home. My husband (43M) works from home. We have a great relationship, but I admit I do get frustrated that he doesn't help more around the house and with the kids (8, 6, 4).

My husband can't aim to save his life. This is a long-standing issue and when we first starting living together (and I worked full-time) cleaning the bathroom was his chore because it drives me crazy. However, bathroom duty fell to me after we had kids. This is fine, but over the last 4 months he's been on a new medicine for his diabetes - the perineum infection side-effect one. Turns out, the reason it can cause perineum infections is it makes you urinate sugar. 

It is so gross. Like, the texture of dried milk in a cereal bowl. I have to SCRUB to get it off. And he can't aim so it's not just the toilet, but the walls, the floor, and the cabinet. So now a task that used to take 30 minutes twice a week takes an hour to an hour three times a week (because sugar molds quickly). 

I've put cleaning wipes in every bathroom and asked him to do a quick wipe down each time he goes, but he would forget frequently and I didn't notice a discernable difference. I asked him to a quick wipe down of the 2 main bathrooms each night to try to mitigate the mess. But he was always too tired or forgot. Today, I told him he needs to take over cleaning the 2 bathrooms he uses the most (just the toilets and surrounding area). I made a point to be calm about it, but explained that cleaning the bathroom makes me resent him because the changes in his medication and his inability to regularly clean up after himself have made the chore extremely onerous for me and he has been unable to complete the tasks that would ease the burden on me. 

He's angry, claiming that I'm holding things he can't control (the change in meds, his struggles aiming,  his ADHD making him forget to wipe things down) against him and that I'm trying to get out of a chore I dislike. I mean, I can't say I LIKE cleaning toilets, but it really wasn't an issue until his meds changed. The new med works great, so I don't want him to get off of it. However, since the majority of my time cleaning the bathroom is cleaning HIS mess, I feel like this responsibility should fall to him. AITA?

TLDR: Husband's diabetes meds changed, so now he urinates sugar. He can't aim, so it makes a giant mess and I think he should clean it up. "
amitheasshole,AITA for going off on my mom because she keeps yelling at my dog.,24,2025-04-03 21:48:59,17,"My mom was over visiting today. I have two dogs. A little dog and a medium sized dog. Anyways my mom was trying to talk to my sister. My dog was playing with her squeak toy. I guess my dog was making too much noise squeaking her toy because my mom got up and screamed at my dog. This isn't the first time she has yelled at my dog. She has yelled at my dog for pawing at her because she wants attention. Knowing that my mom doesn't like this I have cracked down on my dog pawing at her. I personally don't like it either, and it's just rude in general. However, today I felt she crossed the line because my dog was simply playing with her toy. 

Anyway, I went off on her. I was like so she can't even be a dog now? My mom was like I can't hear your sister. I said go outside and talk if it bothers you too much. My mom has been dealing with arthritis in both of her knees, and I try to be sympathetic. I get her groceries, and run errands for her. However, she can be a jerk, and touchy when her legs are bothering her. She will get irritated and unpleasant to be around. After she screams at you, or is short with you. She will say ""oh I'm sorry for yelling, or being short, my legs are bothering me"". I understand that she's in pain, but that shouldn't give her the license to be a jerk to everyone. I also deal with pain as I work a physical job. I have tendinitis in both of my achilles. Sometimes I can barely walk in the morning, it hurts that bad. My body is constantly sore as well. However, I'm still able to respect others. 

Anyway my mom brought the same excuse today that her legs were bothering her. I told her that I understand she is in pain, but that doesn't give her the excuse to be a jerk. She proceeded to blow up at me. I kicked her out of my house. I told her just I need some time away. I do feel bad for going off on her, and I feel bad that she's in pain, but the way she acts makes it very difficult to be around her. You have to walk on egg shells."

I (18M) booked a group holiday months ago with three friends. I‚Äôm the main booker, so everything goes through me. We agreed right at the start: if anyone cancels for any reason, the costs are on them. Everyone said yes.

Now, one of my friends (18F) suddenly decides she doesn‚Äôt want to go anymore. Not because of an emergency, illness, or money trouble, but because of ‚Äútension in the group‚Äù. 

She asks me to cancel her. I contact the travel agency and find out:
	‚Ä¢	It would cost her ‚Ç¨471 in cancellation fees
	‚Ä¢	And me and the other two would have to pay ‚Ç¨240 more each, since the total cost gets split over fewer people

So I say: absolutely not. I‚Äôm not making everyone else pay because she changed her mind.
I also contacted the agency to tell them not to make any changes to the booking unless I give written permission (which I haven‚Äôt).

She keeps pushing for the booking number and tries to contact the agency herself. I eventually give it to her, but I‚Äôm clear: you don‚Äôt get to bail and expect us to clean up the mess for you.

Now she‚Äôs mad. She‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm cold and unreasonable for not just ‚Äúhandling it.‚Äù She‚Äôs being super passive-aggressive, playing the victim, and acting like she‚Äôs taking the high road ‚Äî when in reality, she‚Äôs just making everything harder for the rest of us.

I‚Äôve stopped replying to her messages at this point. We‚Äôre still going on the trip, and her spot is just going to stay empty.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for not cancelling her and refusing to take on extra costs for a trip she voluntarily dropped out of?

amitheasshole,AITA for threatening to cancel my wedding that my dad is paying for if he invites his brother?,3513,2025-04-02 17:27:36,709,"My Fianc√© and I are getting married in May and decided that we didn‚Äôt want to have a traditional + large wedding, we had always really wanted to get married at the courthouse. A big reason for this is because we didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with the drama that comes along with not inviting people who think they are entitled to be invited (specifically my uncle and his wife). My parents were very upset about the courthouse idea because they wanted more of a celebration, so we compromised and rented a big vacation house to get married at. It wasn‚Äôt exactly what we wanted but we were still happy to do it this way. My parents paid for the house. We invited about 10 people, including two couples that my parents are friends with. But now my dad is insisting we invite his brother. I have always felt very strongly about not inviting my dad‚Äôs brother and his wife to our wedding, no matter how small our ceremony is. They are extremely entitled people, have spread many false rumors about my family, trash talked us behind our backs, all while trying to maintain the guise of being one big, perfect loving family. Put simply I don‚Äôt care how closely related I am to them - I do not have any sort of affection for them and I certainly don‚Äôt trust them. 

Now my dad is using the fact that he is paying for everything as a way to control his brother getting invited. He says it‚Äôs also a celebration for him too, so he wants his brother there (even tho his will have other friends and family there). I say it‚Äôs my wedding day and I don‚Äôt want to spend it with someone who has treated us like we‚Äôre beneath him his whole life. My Fianc√© and I have already compromised for my parents by getting married at this house in the first place, we don‚Äôt need to make any more compromises for them. My dad is not budging and is accusing me of being selfish and petty, so now my Fianc√© and I are strongly considering canceling it all and going back to our original courthouse plans. Seeing us get married is a privilege, not a right. 

So AITA here? Does my father actually get more say since he is the one paying for everything?

TLDR; Dad is paying for wedding, insists on inviting jerk brother. Fianc√© and I want to get privately married at courthouse if he doesn‚Äôt budge "
amitheasshole,AITAH for picking up my friends boyfriend so he didn‚Äôt have to walk home?,21,2025-04-03 20:11:20,18,"Short back story for this, Myself (F26), the friend in question (Abby F25) and her boyfriend (Jason M27) all go to the same gym. Abby told me she wasn‚Äôt going because she wasn‚Äôt feeling well so I went by myself, when I got there I noticed Jason was there. We talked a bit and he walked to the gym once he got out of work and planned on walking home (Him and Abby share 1 car and she took it to urgent care after dropping him off at work). I finished my workout and figured the nice thing to do would be to offer Jason a ride home. Now let me preface this with, we‚Äôve all been friends for literal years, I‚Äôve known Abby since Sophomore year of high school and her boyfriend since senior year (after they started dating) 

He thanked me and took me up on the ride home, he also told me he didn‚Äôt want to make Abby come and get him because of how sick she was feeling, we left the gym a little after midnight and I got him home right around 12:10ish. He thanked me once again and that was it, he walked in and I drove home. I woke up late today (up v late playing video games) and I have 8 text messages from Abby, the first one actually said ‚ÄúThanks for driving Jason home I still feel like shit‚Äù but after that they switched to ‚ÄúNext time just let him walk please, I‚Äôm not very comfortable with you driving him especially that late, and all dolled up for the gym‚Äù. I have literally no idea what she means by ‚ÄúDolled up‚Äù and without this being super long the rest of the messages were some variation of ‚ÄúYou being or talking with my boyfriend is not allowed‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt have the energy or mental capacity to respond to it so I simply replied ‚Äúüëç‚Äù. What this an AH move?? I feel like this is a complete over reaction but something‚Äôs nagging at me that I should try to be sympathetic but I feel like that imply I had ill intentions :/"
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my mum in the ambulance with me?,76,2025-04-03 13:33:32,46,"I (then 17f, now 18f) was at school when I suddenly started feeling weird. I could barely breathe, was shaking like a leaf and incredibly dizzy. Me and another student went outside for fresh air, but it only got worse. My teacher was afraid I was having a seizure and called an ambulance. To make this clear, I live in Germany, so an ambulance is paid for by the insurance. She also called my parents, who tried calling me to tell me I wasn't allowed to go into the ambulance, even telling my boyfriend to get me to refuse being taken to the hospital. He had come over to me while I was outside to check on me, but I am incredibly uncomfortable with people close to me seeing me when I'm not feeling well, so I asked him to leave, which he did.  
He told my boyfriend that he should tell me I should stop thinking only about myself since this isn't only about me.

The paramedics took me to the ambulance, since I kept passing out. In the ambulance, they ruled out a seizure and any physical reason, but rather that I was in psychological shock from a lot of stress. While I was in the ambulance, my mother arrived and kept screaming that I should let her in so she could talk with the paramedics to let me go, which I didn't want, since at that time I was still feeling awful. And knowing my mother, I knew how it would go. She is a surgeon herself, and would've debated them on every point possible. She can be a very nice person, but also an absolute Karen. I'm talking yelling at airport staff because the flight was delayed and making a handyman cry for installing something wrong.

The driver told her I didn't want her in the ambulance with me and they'd take me to the hospital. I was placed on a short psychological hold for half an hour, in which they told me I should just tell them everything that was going on at the moment, which helped a lot and I stopped shaking. They released me after an hour, since there wasn't anything physically wrong with me.

Well, I called my mum to tell her I got discharged. She didn't ask if I was okay. Not once. Was completely ice cold. And that she wouldn't pick me up immediately, since she had to work and walk the dog. She works from home (for an insurance company, not a pracitcing surgeon anymore) and can place her hours throughout the day however she wants. I had to wait two hours outside the hospital, since my backpack was still at school, including my wallet with my bus card, my lunch and water. I hadn't eaten anything that day, which she knew. Luckily my boyfriend lives close to the hospital and came over with his bike and brought me something to eat and drink.

She was pissed when she picked me up. Pissed as in yelling at me why I would be so selfish and wouldn't let her, my own mother in the ambulance. This is where I may be the AH. A lot of the stress I had was also caused by my parents, who I had an awful relationship with at the time. And I knew my mother would only further escalate the situation if I had let her in.  
Whenever this topic comes up, she still gets angry at me.

AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not correcting my grandma‚Äôs misunderstanding?,390,2025-04-03 02:38:19,61,"My(15) dad(38) regularly sends me to the bookshop to buy these books for him. He‚Äôs too embarrassed to go buy them himself since the genre/category is romance and women‚Äôs fiction. Won‚Äôt do online shopping either since he hates filling in his information online. Afraid of getting hacked.

Anyway, I ran into my grandma(dad‚Äôs mom) at the shop yesterday. At first she was pleasantly surprised. Then she noticed the book I was carrying, frowned and said I‚Äôm too young to be reading such things, and that my dad‚Äôs being an irresponsible parent for letting me read them.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how to proceed. On one hand, he specifically told me it‚Äôs ‚Äôbetween us‚Äô - no one is to know. On the other hand, I know how much her and Grandpa‚Äôs approval means to him. In the end I chose to keep my mouth shut.

She told me to have lunch with her and while we were at the table, waiting for food, she called and berated my dad. Told him he must have lost his mind to be letting his teenage kid read toxic, abusive romances.

Dad seemed pretty embarrassed when I got home and told me I should have said something before she called and chewed him out."
amitheasshole,AITA if I don't go to my sister's overseas religious wedding?,120,2025-04-03 08:56:53,68,"I (35F) am very low contact with my younger sister (28F), the Golden Child.

She got married legally last year in a destination wedding + holiday (beach destination in our state) paid for by our parents. I paid my own way; parents paid for sister + BIL's flights, accommodation, sister's dress and entire wedding. I delayed the start of my new job to go, and was unpaid during this trip. 

I didn't enjoy it but endured because my parents demanded I attend. I didn't expect to be invited, to be honest, and doubt I would have been had my parents not been holding the money bag.

To clarify, I have no ill will towards my sister. She's found a good man and I'm happy for her. I gave the happy couple a generous cash wedding gift. As far as I'm concerned, I've discharged my duty as her sister.

In the meantime, she's had her husband convert to our family's religion and now plans to have a religious wedding overseas in our family's country of origin. 

He converted locally. They have a religious community they're part of locally. They've lived together for 4 years and co-own an apartment. They could have had one wedding, religious and legal combined; there was no rush regarding the timing of the legal wedding. In my view, this is just a way for them to get yet another holiday out of my parents.

The financial choices my parents make are their own and none of my business. I don't need their money, and don't make any claim to it.

That being said, I don't feel obligated to spend my money taking time off work and travelling overseas to attend my sister and BIL's second wedding/holiday.

When I thought about it, I realised I would rather be at work; I enjoy being at work more than time in my sister's company.

My mother is trying to emotionally blackmail me into going with the classic ""...what will the family think?!"" 

I don't care what the family will think. If I'm taking time off work, and spending money, I want it to be on something I want to do and will enjoy. I've already discharged my duty in attending her wedding. So, AITA?

amitheasshole,"AITA for insisting that my sole provider payment of a $350,000 mortgage counts as a business expense for my wife‚Äôs home business?",749,2025-04-02 23:04:25,619,"AITA for stating that paying the mortgage counts as my contribution to organization of my wife‚Äôs business?

Hello all. I‚Äôm married to a wife I love dearly, but wow we don‚Äôt get along on most things. One of them is the situation with our basement.

I‚Äôm the sole provider‚Äîor at least the primary provider. (I provide at least 90% of our money.) She is a very good stay at home mother. She is also an aspiring business owner, and is finally starting to get it off the ground. She resells little trinkets and assorted goodies on Poshmark.

The issue is that the inventory takes up a LOT of space. It takes up so much space, that when we were in our starter home, it was a constant fight over her buying more inventory but not having anywhere to go with it.

I recently got a massive promotion, and a huge upgraded house. It has over 2,000 square feet, BEFORE counting the expansive open basement. It‚Äôs $350,000, and the monthly payment is $2,500. One reason we got it was so she could essentially have a warehouse where she lives. As the primary breadwinner, I pay for this entirely alone. We‚Äôre both on the property deed, but only I‚Äôm on the mortgage. I also pay for all other life necessities, to include the insurance, gas, and maintenance for three cars, and private tuition for our kids. Due to our quality of life, despite me pulling over $130,000 annual, we are still living paycheck to paycheck. I insist that a house this large is a large luxury‚ÄîI grew up happy in a much smaller house, though she grew up in a house about this size.

Her business is starting to take off, and she finally has the money to pay one employee regularly. She‚Äôs paying this employee-friend to regularly help her organize the massive quantities of inventory that have been unorganized. She takes up over half the basement for her inventory alone, and another quarter for hundreds of gallons of stuff that none of us ever use but she refuses to get rid of. All of my things fit into one quarter of the basement, which I have immaculately organized, mostly because I just don‚Äôt have much.

Point is, basement needs organization, and not my one quarter‚Äîit‚Äôs her three quarters. Full of her stuff. I think I pay enough by paying the mortgage, and that she should have to pay for help if she needs help with those mountains of business inventory and just ‚Äúthings‚Äù she refuses to either use or dispose of. She says I‚Äôm unfair, and contributing nothing since I pay nothing to the helper.

She believes I‚Äôm not contributing to the organization because I have yet to pay a dollar to her employee-friend. She also insists that me paying the mortgage alone doesn‚Äôt count as helping with the business, because she refuses to see a house this large as a luxury and instead thinks I‚Äôm holding the necessity of family housing over her head. Am I the asshole for insisting that paying this mortgage is a luxury I provide her for her business?"
amitheasshole,AITA for chasing someone down to stop letting their dog use my yard as a bathroom?,1009,2025-04-02 21:16:42,1014,"I've (35M) got a freshly remodeled front yard that looks really good. Its about a month old. 
[Think something similar to this.](https://www.needforbuild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Landscape-Design-Landscape-Design-Clairemont-CA-Need-For-Build-Inc-768x576.jpg)

Our old front yard was a grass yard.  We regularly had issues with people letting their pets shit and piss.  Shit was mostly picked up, but our yard reeked of piss when it was hot out.  I put up a ""be respectful no poop or pee signs"", they are still up post remodel. 

 
Finally, my wife and I bit the bullet to remodel the yard.  Now the first 5 feet of the yard next to the sidewalk is rock, and we were hoping that would deter people from letting their dog in our yard.  It doesn't seem like it has.  It is still a noticeable issue to our noses. 
 
This morning, my wife (27F) pointed out someone (30's F) letting their dog go to the bathroom in our yard.  As soon as I saw this I headed for the door and by the time I got outside she was in front of my neighbors yard. I walked her way and yelled at her not to let her dog piss and shit in my yard. 

I pointed out the signs.  She said if her dog has to go, her dog has to go.  She says, i don't know why you are complaining, I cleaned it up.  I was like, ""Not the Piss"".  She was giving me big attitude.  I yelled at her to teach her dog to piss and shit at home.  She told me ""shut up asshole"" and called me a bully.  As she continued walking away I said my yard is not for your dog.  AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA since I told my gf she's freaking out over nothing?,7,2025-04-04 00:33:03,26," My gf has had body issues the whole 5 years we have been together. I love her and remind her how beautiful she is constantly. She has dealt with an eating disorder before me, and I cook for her to make sure she eats stuff other than energy drinks, chips, and sugar.

 As of late, she has been having trouble with acne. She might have like 2 pimples and think the world is over. I had tons of acne in high school, got made fun of, and got over it. She has been dealing with it due to the birth control pills she takes. I have told her multiple times that if she hates it, we can go back to condoms or switch pills. She just doesn't due to fear of other pills' side effects and/or ""not wanting to waste the pills cause they'll throw them away""?

 Today, she went to get this cream that's been helping her with the acne, and apparently, the company stopped making the cream. She's crying on the phone ,driving, talking to me about how she's having a panic attack, and wanting to scream and cry in the store after noticing it is not being made anymore. I first told her to pull over and not to drive if she's panicking like this. Then, I told her a realistic plan of trying other products that I could even buy for her so she could test them. I also told her about this beef tallow thing that she showed me a while back.

 She wasn't happy and told me how she ""fucking hates her skin and wanted to scream as hard as she can in the store"". I told her how she has to find a way to calm down and that something like acne cream shouldn't throw her into a huge melt down by seeing 1 of 999999999999 different creams is gone. She yelled at me and hung up.

 I can understand how much she hates having acne, but trying other creams and potentially finding a better one sounds so easy to me. She will maybe have 4 pimples for a few weeks and won't explode. Am I The Asshole for saying  she shouldn't freak out over it?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not wearing a bra,5,2025-04-04 01:10:27,22,"I (almost 17 F) have stopped wearing a bra for valid reasons. They're expensive, I have small tits, they leave rashes on me and hurt, and most importantly, I don't want to. I stopped wearing one months ago, but for some reason only recently have people had a problem with it. First, at school, a close guy friend of mine said it was indecent and I would not attract respectful guys. First of all, this was random and I never asked for his opinion on it. 2nd, a guy not loving me bc I choose what to do with my body, doesn't sound very respectful to me. Then, 2 boys in my class commented on it very loudly infront of everyone. I embarrassedly covered myself and said ""what the fuck""
After reporting these boys (who I've reported for sexual harassment many times before) the teacher replied with ""well, what do you think you could have done differently?"" I cried so hard that day. Honestly, I took this as an opportunity to become more comfortable in my body and not listen to others opinions, even if they express them like a ""fact"" or an ""order"". 
This morning, I got a message from my youth pastors wife... apparently people at my youth group complained about me not wearing one and she asked me to be more mindful. Honestly, this made me so uncomfortable and heartbroken. Jesus doesnt gaf if u can see my nipples. She was sweet about it but I didn't know how to respond. I just said ok. I always believed modesty was about intention. U can see my nipples? Oh no I hope there aren't any babies around to latch on IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS. Bffr. Im not jumping around or running so I feel no need to wear one. I won't be listening to anyone saying not wearing a bra is inappropriate bc that's honestly not even worth my time, my question is, AITA for ignoring these requests and simply existing?"
amitheasshole,AITA My best friend thinks I‚Äôm copying her,342,2025-04-03 02:08:17,142,"My best friend (29F) thinks I (28F) am copying her, but instead of telling me directly, she‚Äôs been talking to multiple mutual friends and even some of her personal friends about it. I only found out because a friend mentioned it to me.

It started when she wore an outfit to dinner, and I complimented her, saying it looked great on her. A week later, I asked where she got it because I was considering wearing it to a concert we were attending as a group. In the end, I didn‚Äôt even wear that outfit‚ÄîI chose something completely different. But she still told people that me wearing the ‚Äúsame exact outfit‚Äù is weird.

Before the concert, she posted a group picture of all of us with her in that outfit, telling our friend she wanted everyone to know she ‚Äúwore it first‚Äù even though I never wore it. 

We also share an Amazon account, so we can see each other‚Äôs purchases. I‚Äôve been buying a lot of skirts lately because they‚Äôre trendy, and I‚Äôve seen so many people wearing them. But now she thinks I‚Äôm copying her just because I started wearing skirts. She even told a friend that she stopped buying clothes on Amazon so I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcopy‚Äù her anymore and switched to shopping at online boutiques since she knows I don‚Äôt shop there.

Then, I found out she also told our friend that I started wearing jewelry because of her. She recently got a tennis bracelet and sent a picture in our group chat. I said it was cute and that she inspired me to want one too, but I never even bought one. Later, I mentioned in the group chat that I wanted to start wearing jewelry again because I hadn‚Äôt in years and felt bare‚Äîespecially since the rest of the girls in our group always accessorize. I even sent pictures of jewelry I liked, and none of it looked like hers. She responded saying she didn‚Äôt like any of the pieces I sent and that they weren‚Äôt cute.

A little while later, I bought a $15 ring off Amazon for a group dinner because I thought it would make my fingers look less chubby. It wasn‚Äôt designer or brand name, just something simple. Later, I found out she told our friend that she would never wear fake jewelry and that if I ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt afford real jewelry, I shouldn‚Äôt be wearing any at all.‚Äù That comment really shocked and hurt me.

I don‚Äôt understand why she feels this way. I get that she has the right to her feelings, but if the roles were reversed, I wouldn‚Äôt care at all. If she wore something I wore a week later, I‚Äôd think it was cute and say, ‚ÄúTwinsies!‚Äù No one else in our friend group feels the way she does‚Äîeveryone else loves to match and coordinate outfits.

Am I actually copying her? It was never my intention, and I‚Äôve never worn anything similar to her before, so I don‚Äôt get why she suddenly thinks this way. I feel really hurt and haven‚Äôt felt like talking to her or patching things up because she seems so set in her opinion. It just feels so childish, especially since we‚Äôre both almost 30. It‚Äôs like high school drama all over again."
amitheasshole,AITA for interrupting my mom‚Äôs phone call because I thought she was being scammed?,6,2025-04-04 00:03:03,12,"I (42m) am visiting my mom (69f) and staying with her for a short time. Today, while she was watching my nephew (6m), I walked into her room to get ready to take him home.

When I entered, she was visibly upset, freaking out, and on a speakerphone call. The person on the other end mentioned something like ""account,"" ""bank information,"" or ""PIN"" (I don‚Äôt recall exactly), and she started reading numbers aloud.

I work in IT security, and since she and my nephew had been having a nice time earlier, her distress seemed sudden and unexplained. Worried she might be falling for a financial scam, I rushed over and asked, ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I gently asked her to pause for a second, explaining I was concerned she might be disclosing sensitive info to a scammer. I requested to see the phone‚Äîshe was hurriedly entering information‚Äîbut once I saw it was her bank‚Äôs app, I immediately handed it back. My interruption didn‚Äôt delay her from finishing what she was doing.

I had about 5 seconds to assess the situation, and I genuinely believed she could be in danger. I wouldn‚Äôt have interfered otherwise.

After dropping off my nephew and returning to her home, she told me I was out of line, that I‚Äôd violated her privacy, and needed to be more considerate. I reiterated that I only acted because I thought she was at risk. She repeatedly said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dumb enough to enter bank account information \[for a scammer\]‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm stupid.‚Äù I explained that even smart people get tricked, and I‚Äôd acted because she was upset + entering numbers after a question about her bank.

I understand why she‚Äôd find my interruption annoying, but I don‚Äôt think it was inconsiderate‚ÄîI was trying to protect her. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to apologize to my dad?,118,2025-04-03 07:45:32,47,"I (22F) yelled at my dad (50M) yesterday after he lit up firecrackers indoors, feet away from us while we're having dinner, he's not mentally ill.

Hearing yelling itself gets me super anxious let alone hearing the sound of firecrackers couple feet away from me, I yelled at him and told him to grow up, which isn't like me at all, I never lash out or get angry, but right there I lost control. He although, looked at me with a grin and said ""the next one will be aimed at you"" i looked him dead in the eyes and told him to try, in my head I was sure he won't do it, but he was about to actually do it, but mom stepped in and threatened to leave the house.

He stopped after my mom yelled at him, and acted like the victim, now is giving everyone the silent treatment.

My mom told me today that i should apologize for raising my voice at him, I refused and she said ""he's your father, doesn't he deserves an apology even if you didn't do anything wrong?"" I was speechless. I know I'm not in the wrong here.

I'm sick of apologizing for not doing anything wrong, low grades, not greeting him properly first thing in the morning, hiding bad grades, hiding good grades cuz it's never enough, laughing loud, making jokes, laughing to myself...im done,  this is ridiculous. 

Edit: I can't move out, I'm a full time student, the only time I get to be away from home is being at uni dorms, I came back home 4 days ago after being at the dorms for 5 weeks(i try to stay as much away as possible). Also it's culturally known here that girls and boys don't move out of their parents house until they get married so after graduation im living back at home with them.

amitheasshole,WIBTA for letting my family borrow our car.,12,2025-04-03 19:49:46,106,"My sister (married) pulled out the driveway through the lawn and damaged her radiator. Yes it was her fault.

My wife doesn‚Äôt want to give them the car even though we‚Äôre not gonna be home because she claims they‚Äôre not gonna be responsible with it. And because my dad smokes and he might get in the car too but he never smokes in the car. 
I‚Äôm saying  she‚Äôs being selfish for not letting them use our car while we‚Äôre gone. Am I the asshole? I have previously let my sister use my BMW before and it came back without a scratch. In perfect condition. That‚Äôs the unbiased story.  

Now my opinions. 
Everyone makes mistakes. She learned from it and although she doesn‚Äôt take care of her stuff she never damaged my things. 

It‚Äôs just a car. Regular used civic. What is family for if not helping out each other when we make mistakes and yes even dumb ones. As long as they learned their lesson. "

AITA for telling him that if he cuts ties with her, he cuts ties with me? I feel like im being a good brother, but because of the way i was raised there is this little voice telling me im still an asshole for saying that to the man that raised me...

for context, I came out as a trans man to my family when I had just turned 13. I struggled with my identity for a long time. I didn't like the idea of being trans, because I didn't think trans people could be loved, or even liked. So I dressed hyper-feminine for a period of time to try and ""fix"" myself before I eventually accepted who I was. It was a while before I came out to my parents with this, about 8 months. When I did come out, they agreed to my name and pronouns, but they didn't like the whole idea. 

As for the arguments, they've happened pretty much the entire time I've been out. My dad has said to me that he thinks the ""whole trans thing"" is wrong and against nature, and that I was groomed into being this way. I can't get him to see my side of the story. Even after explaining my experience, he thinks I am lying to win the argument. He doesn't understand what being trans is on a basic level, often saying things like ""You want to be a man"" or ""do you think that if you take T people will THINK you're a man?"" among other things. He says that people are forced to support it, otherwise they are shunned by society, and that doctors want you to be trans to make money off you. He told me that the only reason he calls me by my name and pronouns is because he knows I would hate him if he didn't. He's also suggested we should ""try other alternatives to transitioning"" but he won't elaborate. I can only assume he means conversion therapy. Lastly, he has said that he will never support me and my transition, but says that he still loves me and wants the best for me. 

I continue to fight with him even though his mind cant be changed, because I want my parent's support the most. All I end up doing by arguing with him like this is making him upset, and exposing my two younger siblings to aggressive arguing. It's such an important thing for me, but I know at the same time that I shouldn't continue to argue with him since it is hurting other people. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for Calling Out My Landlord in a Group Chat?,7,2025-04-03 22:55:53,12,"So, I (27M) live in a small apartment complex with about ten other tenants. We all have a group chat for things like maintenance issues, package mix-ups, and general building updates. Our landlord, Mark (mid-50s), is also in the chat, but he rarely responds unless it‚Äôs about rent.

The problem? He sucks at fixing things.

For the past six months, we‚Äôve had ongoing issues‚Äîleaky ceilings, broken washers, heating problems, you name it. Every time someone reports something, Mark either ignores it or promises to ‚Äúsend someone‚Äù and then nothing happens. Meanwhile, he has no problem reminding us about rent two weeks in advance.

Last month, my sink started leaking badly. I reported it to him privately‚Äîno response. A week later, I messaged again‚Äîhe left me on read. Finally, I brought it up in the group chat, thinking maybe if other tenants chimed in, he‚Äôd take it seriously. Turns out, almost everyone had unresolved issues too. A few people started piling on, asking why their problems hadn‚Äôt been addressed either.

That‚Äôs when Mark finally responded‚Äînot to apologize or fix anything, but to call me out for ‚Äúmaking him look bad‚Äù in front of the other tenants. He said if I had an issue, I should‚Äôve kept it between us and not turned the chat into a ‚Äúcomplaint session.‚Äù I told him I did message him privately, multiple times, and got ignored. Then I asked if he planned to actually fix anything.

Now, he‚Äôs claiming I ‚Äúdisrespected‚Äù him and is threatening to kick me out when my lease is up. Some of the other tenants think I went too far, while others thanked me for speaking up.

AITA for putting him on blast in the group chat?"
amitheasshole,AITA Over washing the dishes,12,2025-04-03 18:41:07,16,"I (72F) do all the cooking, preparing our main meal 4-5 days a week. My husband (73M) is assigned to wash the dishes. I think the dishes should be washed as often as I  cook; that when I'm ready to start the next meal, all the tools should be clean and available to me and the space should be open so I can stack the dishes that I use as I cook. Sometimes I just go ahead and wash them, simultaneously awash in resentment. When I ask him to do it, he does it, simmering in resentment. (all puns intentional). I'm considering just not preparing a meal until the dishes are clean. Is that being an A? "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my father that my partner may or may not attend my cousin's wedding.,21,2025-04-03 16:32:28,22,"So, my father told me that my cousin is planning to get married later this year and insists that I attend with my partner. I told him I will attend, but I'd have to ask my partner whether she would come or not. Then my father says that it's rude for her to not come and it would be a huge embarrassment for him in front of our relatives if she didn't. It seems that he's been going around telling relatives about my partner and is planning to introduce her to them at this wedding.

I got angry at my father for unilaterally deciding that my partner and I will attend the wedding without talking to either of us, then calling us rude if we don't comply. Also, no wedding invitations have been sent out by the couple. This is my father giving me a heads up about the wedding after he heard about it from the couple's parents. 

Some minor details: I am not married to my partner, but have been together for over a decade, so we're de facto family. I personally don't think this is an inportant, though correct me if I'm wrong. I'm from an East Asian culture, though I have been heavily westernized. My partner is fully western.

Later in the day, I asked my partner and she said she'll come, so there's no real harm or foul in the end. But who is the asshole here?

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have since spoken with my father and he has apologized about his behaviour. So the situation has been resolved and I'm just trying to do some post-mortem analysis.

Update: my father now intends to ask my cousin if she can send me an invitation to their wedding. Fuck that. I'm not going to become the person who begs the bride to get invited to their wedding. I'm not embarassing myself or my partner like that."
amitheasshole,AITA for embarrassing my brother infront a girl?,20,2025-04-03 15:32:05,26,"(I HAD TO UPLOAD IT AGAIN) Hello everyone i know the title kinda bad but here‚Äôs wat happened. So last year we went to Texas all the way from Jamaica me,my brother and grandma for 2 weeks. First day we settled and got everything organized, it was around the 3 or 4th day we heard of a event keeping and me and bro decided to check it out and it was a decent length drive there. We got there and realize it was slightly bigger than we expected and decided to split up and meet back at the car in 2 hrs. It was bout a hour or so when he founded me and asked for the keys to get something out the car. (Side note: I am 24 and he is 18 but he only has a learners license) the 2 hrs we‚Äôre up and I got to the meet point exactly 4 mins late and I didn‚Äôt see the car so I thought he probably drove to the exit and was waiting and not dumb enough to actually drive leave me Ina foreign country and him only having a learners license. My phone was left in the car because I am a plumber and lost 2 phone to water damage I developed a bad habit of leaving it in my car so I couldn‚Äôt called. I went back around the event for 30 min and back at the meet point and exit and still no sign and I was alrdy furious. I beg a couple for a call and called my grandma to call my brother to come and pick me up waited around min when she called back and told me she isn‚Äôt getting through to him.  
   
I began to walk back and damn I got to say Texas was hot asf and it was just boiling my anger to the next limit I reached a small little town and actually had to pay someone 10usd to get a call this time my grandma actually got through to him and told him to pick me up in the town area, when he finally got here it was a total time of basically 2hrs and it wasn‚Äôt even him driving the car it was some random girl which just made me lose it even more. Turns out he meet her at the event and she somehow managed to convince him to explore some good areas (their actual words) and got lost in time After they finish chatting my ears out and finally realized I wasn‚Äôt even smiling an inch my brother started giggling chatting bout it was a honest mistake and at least I got to enjoy the event a little longer.  
  
 I simply sigh and then lost it and lashed out at him and asking him where he found the logic to left me stranded without a phone Ina foreign place and not telling me anything before he left I snatched the keys made sure he has his phone and money and left him and the girl and went home he got home about a hour after me and began chatting to my grandma saying he know he wrong and apologizes (which he didn‚Äôt) and started saying I didn‚Äôt have to embarrass him like that tho he ended up going back down home 2 days later saying he can‚Äôt enjoy a vacation with me because of my temper and behavior so gentle people AITA btw sorry if my English isn‚Äôt so English so any questions just ask me and 10usd is like 1500 in my country so I was salty I had to pay that for a single phone call"

A few years ago, something terrible happened in the family, affecting her and her family the most (would not like to discuss this) and since then, she has been asking me to move in with them so I can be with my cousin (15F) cause she is lonely, leave my job, friends and pretty much my whole life here.

amitheasshole,AITA for leaving my boss behind at work,17,2025-04-03 15:46:56,26,"Hello f21. I work at a theatre doing janitorial work part time while I go to school full time . Last night I was scheduled to work 7-10:20, to close up the theatre. At around 8:30 my boss tells me we are going to be out late tonight because she has to do inventory and she‚Äôs behind (per theatre rules someone must accompany the boss to the bank to drop off the cash made that day)  . I tell her no worries and go about my job. I end up finishing early, because nobody saw the last several movies and I‚Äôm done about 9:55 (she still hasn‚Äôt started inventory at this time I don‚Äôt know what she was doing the entire shift ) . 

No biggie I knew I was going to have to wait around. I sit there for TWO hours after I‚Äôm done doing my job, and she comes into the break room and says she doesn‚Äôt know how long she is going to be and that I now need to take 2 10 minute unpaid breaks plus a 30 minute unpaid lunch. This is about an hour of unpaid time of me just sitting there, and would put me at 1 am.

 At this point I‚Äôm annoyed, frustrated, tired, I just want to go home and smoke, and she‚Äôs just still counting away (I even asked to help her but inventory is only a manager position I guess ). I thought I was the only one around and cried for about a minute or two just letting my frustration out and she comes into and says I can leave and that she feels bad. Now I feel bad that she might‚Äôve heard me crying or that I was upset, because it is my job to wait on her, but I didn‚Äôt think I would be sitting there for an entire extra shift and having an hour of that being unpaid.

A few shots in, one my friends, let's call him James, was drunk and decided to show a video of him singing because he thought he was good at singing. To avoid being rude and because I thought that's where the topic of his singing would come to an end, I told him he sounded pretty good. However, our one sober friend (Kendall) encouraged him to sing ""We Don't Talk Anymore"" by Charlie Puth. Keeping in mind that I was drunk and James is tone-deaf, I had a very difficult time not laughing. For context, two other friends, Carlos and Logan, left the room because they could not handle the second-hand-embarrassment. I was in the room with another friend, Gustavo (who also was drunk/tipsy), and we decided to stay to not make him feel bad. In retrospect, I feel pretty bad for laughing, but how much of an asshole am I?"
amitheasshole,AITA? girlfriend doesn't like when I come over. (in our 20s),8,2025-04-03 20:16:35,32,"Me (25F) and my girlfriend of 3 years (28F) each live in seperate flats with roomates. We see eachother 4 nights a week and we always meet at my flat. I have been at her place before but only like once every half a year. If we stay at her place, its only because I insisted to do so. She likes her living situation and her roommates. Recently I asked if I could come over more often to her place and not only always staying at my place. She was not happy about it and said that she is not comfortable with me being in her flat. She then explained that she wants her flat to be her own space and that it feels invasive if I enter the space. Meanwhile, she basically lives at my place (she knows where everything is, is friends with my flatmates, joins social activities etc.). I told her that this is unfair and that I would want to feel welcome at her place. She does not understand this and does not see the need to change anything about it or compromise in some way. I am having a hard time accepting this, is it weird of me to have this desire? I asked her to only stay at her place for one night once a month, which she also doesnt like. She then said, I can come if I insist, but she will not be happy about it and not feel comfortable. 
Disclaimer: I know for a fact that she is not hiding anything from me. She is a really great person and apart from this topic she is really supportive and open for compromises.

amitheasshole,AITA for not making the dinner that my husband requested?,882,2025-04-02 17:59:51,932,"My (28f) husband (31m) and I have been married for a little over two years. I'm currently about 2 months pregnant with our first child.

My husband works as the general manager of a local fast food franchise. I'm not under employment anywhere, but I do a lot of freelance technical writing work from home.

My husband's position pays surprisingly well with good benefits, but he's been having to put in a ton of hours lately, as staffing has been a major problem.

The other day, he texted me to let me know that he would be working late; AGAIN, for the fourth time this week. A little later, I texted him that I was going grocery shopping and asked if there was anything special he'd like me to pick up while I was there. He responded: ""Get me a couple packs of peach sparkling water, please. Also, I could really use some comfort food. You think I could get some meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and corn?""

I responded with thumbs up and winking, kissing face emojis. I bought him everything he asked for. However, I had already thawed pork chops for dinner that night, and, honestly, they were on the verge of going bad so I had to use them up.

When my husband got home, he asked where his meatloaf was. I told him that I'd bought the ingredients but that I wasn't serving meatloaf that night. He then said that this was the one thing he'd been looking forward to for the past couple of hours, and that I'd made it seem as if I was going to make it for him. I told him that I'd never said any such thing, and that I'm not his domestic servant, taking dinner orders.  He shot back that if I didn't want to make what he asked for that I should have just said so, but I said that all I'd indicated was that I'd pick up the food, not that I'd make his requested meal that evening.

This whole thing could probably be written off as a miscommunication, but, honestly, I'm angry that my husband seems to assume that I'm at his beck and call to make whatever meal he wants. And he's angry that I apparently ""can't do one nice thing for him when he asks."" Who's the AH?

amitheasshole,AITA: For telling my stepfather he will not be apart of my future?,588,2025-04-02 20:00:46,83,"My stepfather (m51) and I (f19) have not had a necessarily good relationship even before he married my mother, we tolerate each other considering we have one thing in common; my mother/his wife being an important part of our lives. I have lived with my mother,stepfather and sibling since I was 16. He has very specific rules of living in his house, which I follow, I also pay rent now because that just makes sense since I‚Äôm an adult. These rules since I was 16 have gotten really strict over the years to the point he argues with me over the littlest mistakes I do, that is fine but these days he tries to find anything to argue with me about not just rules. He starts the arguments when he knows I‚Äôm the only one in the house, or if my mother is not around. I tend to just stay in my room, cook food when he‚Äôs not home or just stay out studying or at a friend‚Äôs house to avoid conflict. His native language and mine are not the same, the language here is my second one so I don‚Äôt like arguing since I can‚Äôt express myself well. 

The arguments have been happening more frequently to the point he does it in front of my mother too. I can tell she is uncomfortable seeing it, but doesn‚Äôt add to the situation because she doesn‚Äôt want to pick sides. He uses the language against me while arguing, telling me not to speak my native language in the house either wether to my mother when I don‚Äôt know a word in the language spoken here or when I‚Äôm calling my dad since he only speaks our native language. This coupled with other things happening has put me on edge. 

I work and study. Last week I was getting ready for work; a late shift and only my stepfather was home, I was putting my things in my bag and he came over to start an argument over catching my mother and I having talked in my native language the day before. He argued that we should not speak in a language he doesn‚Äôt know because we could be talking bad about him, we weren‚Äôt talking about him but about how I wanted to change work places, same company different town, but he didn‚Äôt believe me. We even switched languages to his when he came into the living room when it happened.The argument got heated and words were thrown around on both sides, he said something very left field that he knew I didn‚Äôt like discussing (a traumatic time when I 15) I was so angry I said he now had no place in my future, my future wedding he wouldn‚Äôt attend but my mother could, my future children he wouldn‚Äôt be a grandfather to but my mother would be a grandma. He told my mother, who for the last week has been tiptoeing around it, I feel bad for her as she is caught in the middle of this and apologised to her, and I know I‚Äôd been way too harsh on my stepfather but I don‚Äôt want my future to be filled with more argument especially not on special things like a possible wedding or kids. I will be moving out soon since that‚Äôs been my plan the last few months, I finally found an affordable apartment and maybe that will relieve some tension. "
amitheasshole,AITA My Friend and I Disagree on How Much Money I Owe Her,8,2025-04-03 19:17:53,29,"Last weekend, myself and two other people went out for some drinks at a nice cocktail bar. We each had two drinks, all the same thing so our bill would split up evenly. At the end of the night, she offered to pay the check and have all of us Venmo her, which we all agreed to. The next morning, she took out the receipt to calculate what we owed her, and realized that the bar had double-charged us for a few of the drinks, meaning that there were 9 drinks on the tab instead of 6. The bill was $160. She said she must've not realized how much it was when she put her card down. It was obviously a mistake, so I said that maybe she could try to call the bar and see if they would be nice enough to fix the charge. She didn't call them, so then I suggested she call her credit card company, explain what happened, and try to dispute the amount she got over-charged for.

A few days later, I asked her if she had made any progress, and she said that her credit card bill was due and had to pay it. Totally understand. Then I asked her if she had ever filed a disupte claim. She told me she called her credit card company and asked them to remove the charge because ""she was drunk and didn't check the amount before she paid"" to which they obviously replied ""No"". She then asked us to pay her for the $160, meaning that I would owe about $55 instead of around $35 (pre tip). I asked if she could just try to file a dispute and see what happens, especially since you can still file even after you've paid the statement and they would've just credited her on her next billing cycle, but she said that she wasn't going to do that.

I know that the amount isn't that much money, but I'm kind of frustrated with how she handled this and then just expected us to be fine with paying for the mistake. First off, she had two opportunites at the bar to realize the amount was wrong- when she put her card down to pay, and when she calculated the tip. Then, even though calling the restaurant or filing a dispute wasn't guaranteed, she didn't try to get the money back. Who tells their credit card company they were drunk when they bought something? That's what bothered me the most. I know I probably sound pretty cheap, but I feel like I'm just throwing away $20 because she was too lazy to try and fix the problem. AITA for just offering to pay what I originally owed and not the extra money?

Edited to fix my math: the $160 includes the tip she added, which she also calculated based on the extra drinks."
amitheasshole,AITA for using a cup from the kitchen and/or for freaking out on my roommate who has OCD?,4,2025-04-03 21:17:36,13,"My roommate and I have lived together for 3 years and I‚Äôve learned a lot about how the disorder works for her and what her do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs are. She has the HSV virus (she has oral coldsores about once or twice a year) and so things that touch her mouth are ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù in her eyes and need to be kept separate from everything else. That means the kitchen and her bathroom sink are contaminated and anything from those areas are not allowed anywhere else. If there happens to be a ‚Äúbreach‚Äù then she can either obsess about it for hours and scrub whatever surface or item that was messed up or she trusts me to wipe it with a Lysol wipe and it‚Äôs clean after that. 

Today, while she was gone at work, I refilled our cat‚Äôs automatic feeder and was going to use a disposable cup from the kitchen to do so. I realized it‚Äôd be faster to pour from the bag so didn‚Äôt use the cup and simply placed it on top of the wet food cans we have. My mistake is that I didn‚Äôt dispose of the cup before she got home so she sees it with the cat stuff and freaks out on me. I normally know how to de-escalate by wiping them off with Lysol wipes, but even after I did so, she brought up my room (where I don‚Äôt follow her rules and will bring a cup of water from the kitchen and leave on my desk) and called me and my room contaminated, that I was no help and that I don‚Äôt respect her. She also said she has to deep clean all of the automatic feeders and throw away all the cat food and the wet food cans. I lashed back out to her telling her that she doesn‚Äôt have an active cold sore, cats can‚Äôt get cold sores, it‚Äôs real in her mind but nothing is actually wrong or contaminated, and that she needs to seek therapy because this is insane and stupid. 

I understand that she can‚Äôt help it but it gets to a point every now and again that her getting pissed off at me for things normal people do that won‚Äôt harm anyone and is only an issue because of her disorder is too much. Also, I‚Äôm pissed that she says I‚Äôm no help. I fill her water bottle almost daily. If she fills it and there‚Äôs a drop of water on the outside, I Lysol it. I‚Äôve even had to wipe off 32 cans of cat food when my brother helped us with groceries not knowing the rules and placed them on the kitchen counter. I‚Äôm tired of having to tip toe and then getting berated for things that genuinely have no effect on anything besides the anxiety in her brain.

amitheasshole,AITA for not being more apologetic to my mom,8,2025-04-03 18:32:45,10,"Some backstory, my stepdad and mom met years ago. My stepdad had two daughters from a previous marriage and my mom had my sister and I(8 at the time). Our families combined and we were good for awhile. Then my mom started beefing with their mom and even once got into physical alteration. They hated one another and my mom said that my stepsisters mom gave them hell because she couldn't accept the fact that we were building a new family with her daughters. Eventually my mom and stepsisters started arguing and they left to move in with their mom and that seemed like it was the end of our family. My mom prohibited us from talking to them and that was that.

Years later my mom and I got into a argument where she ended up being arrested and I moved in with my boyfriend. I decided to reconnect with my stepsisters as I was 19 now and wanted to reconnect. So I went over and hung out with them at their mom's house where we played games and the only words exchanged with their mom was ""hello"", ""how are you?"", and ""goodbye"". I told my stepdad and he seemed fine with it.

Eventually I moved back in with my mom as per her request and a few days ago I told her I planned on hanging with my stepsisters at the mall. She said that's fine. She asked me what I was doing after and I told her I was planning on going to their house to hang out. She then told me it was weird how I would go over to their mom's house knowing the host between the two of them. I admittedly got defensive I told her it's not that weird bc I was going there to hang out with my sisters not their mom. She started yelling about how I was unloyal and didn't know where my priorities in family lies. We argued and then I left to mall and afterwards didn't go to their house out of respect of my mom's boundary.

Shes now making cryptic post on Facebook towards me, telling me everything thinks I'm a entitled unloyal child (I'm 20) and at first told me to leave her house, then told me to come back as I couldn't abandon my blood sisters and she will let me stay two months, now she's telling me again that I have to apologize by the end of the week or leave. As I've told her I understand her pain towards their mom and Im not trying to take minimize it but to come at me months after I visited their house and say I'm disloyal is childish. I've even been accommodating leaving the house when she wants me out and not going to my stepsisters house anymore.

I need perspective AITA, I've apologized for what I can and catered to her feelings but she still saying I'm disloyal and an entitled child."
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I faked being sick to get out of a rugby tournament where they'll likely use me as a benchwarmer,6,2025-04-03 20:53:07,8,"I am a college rugby player, and I have been playing since January of 2022. I only ever took one season off in the fall of 2023 (when I was on a semester abroad). However, they've more or less put me on the back burner because a guy who has been doing football since he was 12 is kinda their star.

Admittedly, I'm not the best. And outside of some lacrosse in middle school, I haven't really done too many combat-related sports. But I have been on the team my whole career. Additionally, I was one of the few guys who actually went to tournaments and didn't quit for half the season following an injury. \[Edit: last semester / Fall 2024\]

I did politely ask one of the coaches (the one that wants to go pro) that I feel that my experience has earned me more than just a back-up position. He was professional about telling me that 'it is what it is' and that I just an't compete with this 'since the age of 12' guy.

It's worth mentioning that, to my memory, he didn't say anything about 'we'll do what we can' or 'I'll try to fit you in'. Simply 'You're not more-than-30-seconds' material. (Not those exact words, but those were the vibes.)

\[Edit\]  
I was finally starting to get some field time last spring. But then the new guy came in and I am beginning to feel like Woody in the first Toy Story.

One of the only reasons I would want to do this is that we haven't done social in forever (because there haven't been enough involved people to decide who can be the designated driver). Otherwise, I'd be sacrificing the entire weekend for, at most, a minute of field time. That would likely be if someone got injured.

Would I be the asshole if I decided to fake being sick to get out of this tomorrow?

I can see the perspective of me being a bad teammate by skipping an important tournament in the off-chance they need a backup guy. Admittedly, I am a little afraid it's gonna be a little more fun than just standing around and then going to a party with guys who almost never text me back.

I also respect my time enough that I'm not willing to do a long car ride on Friday, a tournament on Saturday, and a long drive on Sunday to be on the field for less than 2 minutes across 3 28-minute games. Not to mention I'm most likely never gonna go pro. So this isn't exactly gonna be my 'Disney Channel Original Movie' moment. On top of that, I could be wasting valuable study time for an exam worth 20 percent of my grade a week from Tuesday.

What's your take, Reddit?

\[Slight edit:\]  
It's worth mentioning that I would go to literally any other tournament that would be a day trip away. And have done so, gladly. I just don't know if I'm willing to do a time commitment of essentially 48 hours for less than 6 minutes of field time.

amitheasshole,AITA for calling my boyfriends sister a bitch for inserting herself in our personal fight.,133,2025-04-03 03:00:05,132,"So last night me and my boyfriend got into a pretty heated argument. It wasn‚Äôt anything too bad but emotions were all over the place, it‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt ever get through. I was pretty upset and I was crying. My boyfriend in the heat of moment suggested I call my abuser, and move back in with him. This triggered me because I know he didn‚Äôt mean it and he was just trying to be spiteful. He has admitted to doing it before. So since he said that I got really triggered. His sister then comes in our room and started inserting herself into her fight. She started saying ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just frustrated, He‚Äôs just upset‚Äù And talking over me when I trying to explain to him what he said was wrong. So I got angry with her and told her to ‚ÄúPlease stop, you know what he said wasn‚Äôt right. And please stop taking sides during our fight it‚Äôs weird.‚Äù I really just wanted her to leave the room and I don‚Äôt appreciate a teenager inserting themselves into my relationship. Then she plays victim and started crying making the situation about herself. Her brother was taking her out of the room and when I snapped and said ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs acting like a bitch anyways.‚Äù Because I felt like she was. 

Me and my boyfriend of course talked and made up today like we always do. Then his sister got home today from school and was ignoring me, acting like she couldn‚Äôt stand anywhere near me and refusing to go in any room I was in. It really is bothering me because she was the one inserting herself into my relationship and now she‚Äôs acting like I did something to her. So AITA? 

Edit: First of all yes we were arguing but no one was yelling or screaming. We were talking and I was crying, I tend to cry quietly. His sister literally just walked into our room after he suggested I go back to my abuser because she walks in randomly at times. I wasn‚Äôt being loud.

Second. We don‚Äôt fight all the time. It is not everyday she has to hear fights. Me and my partner both hold in things until we can‚Äôt anymore. And then sometimes things are said that are way out of pocket. This was the first fight we had in about six months. So I just want to explain that.

Third. The sister is 17, and i‚Äôm 19. We‚Äôre both teenagers i‚Äôm not way older than her. We‚Äôre around the same age and she‚Äôs said way worse things to me before, and did worse to me. I‚Äôm not making an excuse but I think there‚Äôs too many assumptions on here‚Ä¶

amitheasshole,AITA for convincing my dad not to get start a company with his son in law?,2,2025-04-04 01:15:11,2,"So for reference we all live in Toronto and immigrated from a 3rd world country after my parents were successful in starting a company.

My sister married a man from a village who doesn‚Äôt have many skills, and in our country it is traditional to have the man pay for a house. But since his family was really poor, our family paid for everything including a jeep, a 2 million dollar house in Oakville and basically everything else. But oh well, bc my sister likes him.

He‚Äôs actually pretty hard working and he definitely loves my sister (he took out debt and gifted her a BMW when he barely knew her) and has pretty good people skills.

But anyways, he asked for large warehouse that he would run in Canada while my parents made the product back home. But I felt that it‚Äôs very unfair when they literally gave him everything and it was all handed to him, when he has not proven that he is a good business person (PS he dropped out of an extremely prestigious business school in our country) 

Anyways I‚Äôll be honest, I felt a bit jealous, and i told my dad not to buy him the warehouse bc in accounting class we learned that if you want to start a business the percentage you contribute should determine the profit you get back. 

I feel this is fair, but I also think that my jealousy was maybe a bit much, he is an honest person, very hard working and continues to work minimum wage even though he could just sit at home, but I just felt jealous bc he just married into our family. 

But he has no other skills and he has very well raised kids and I feel bad that they basically have no way to get richer, and they wouldn‚Äôt have such a nice life if it wasn‚Äôt for my parents.

Like I have some friends who having hard working parents who can barley afford to RENT in Toronto. 

But I feel like this is the same thing for me bc I was just handed this life (to take over the company) bc i was born into this family. And I think my jealousy was very obvious when I was talking about him. Honestly that feels pretty bad too, to know my parents think I am jealous my sister and brother in law. 

However, I told them to leave more of the inheritance to my sister bc she‚Äôs also doesnt have any college degree or trade skills and is a stay at home mom (so she has no income), and her kids are very cute and deserve a good life. But adding onto that  I said it was bc with my business major I could make more money with the company (gosh I sound so bad right now)

Anyways, I don‚Äôt know how I should approach this bc it‚Äôs really uncomfortable, obviously parents want to see the best in their kids, but it irks me to know that I came across as jealous and greedy‚Ä¶

amitheasshole,AITA For Refusing to Ask my friend to drop the case he has on my sister?,191,2025-04-03 00:27:10,92,"So a bit ago my sisters 16 year old daughter hit some dudes car. His parked car. She made a dent on the whole left side of the vehicle and as the car in question is pretty expensive, their insurance limits won‚Äôt cover this one. So after my sisters insurance came in and paid what they could, my friend (the dude) filed a collision claim with his insurance and now his insurance suing my sister for the rest of the amount, and after all that wrapped up, the judge ordered for wage garnishment (it‚Äôs legal in our state). 

My sister wants me to ask him to like drop it, o guess. I really think this dude is just doing it because he can since like he‚Äôs a chief at a hospital or something. I told her nah because this one‚Äôs kind of on her daughter. Sister only asked because she thinks she can‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù with the amount being taken from her to pay off the remaining amount.

amitheasshole,AITA for pointing out to my husband that he failed to call me like he said he would?,5,2025-04-03 19:41:00,19,"My husband texted me and asked me a week ago if we had ""anything going on next Mon., Tues, Wed.""  I replied no.  When he got home from work, he told me that he was going on a fishing trip in Florida for the next week for three days with his brother and some co-workers.  It actually ended up being 4 days, but he wasn't counting the day he was coming home as a day, even though he won't be home until dinner time. 
We have 2 young children at home, so we actually did have things ""going on,"" but nothing I couldn't handle with just one babysitting help from my mom.
The entire time he was gone, I hardly heard a word from him. He texted our group friend chat that I am on sharing pics, and he called two of the nights to say goodnight to the kids; otherwise, he didn't text or call me.  I was not really bothered by this.  But last night, he specifically told me he would call me before his flight left this morning, which was leaving around 11.  Mind you, I have no idea what airline, flight info, or even what hotel he was at. I never received a call this morning.  I texted a little after 11 and asked if he was on the plane.  No answer because it must've taken off. He just called now  to say he landed. I asked why he never called this morning.  He said sorry, he was sleeping in the Uber and then handling the airport stuff. (He only brought a carry on.)  And that he didn't have time.  My response was that he did have time, but I'm not going to make a thing about it. He then said ""are you mad at me?"" I again said that he did have time to call me, but I'm not going to make a big thing out of it.  (Because he never takes ownership.  He always just says Sorry, my bad. Move on.) Anyway, he said ""this is great to come home to.  Thanks a lot."" And hung up on me. 
I honestly feel like he has no respect for me with the whole way he did this trip. We didn't discuss it beforehand. He gave me no information as to where he was going to be. And I didnt even know his flight info. I know one person out of the 6 that he went with.  I feel like his forgetting to call me is just another thing   to pile on. AITA for pointing out that he didn't bother to call me before he left? We have Life360, so I was able to see where he was the whole time, but  I think that's besides the point. "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I asked my bf's sister to move out or start paying rent.,24,2025-04-03 10:36:52,75," Hi, first time posting here (i think)
 
So, I have this issue, I (34F) and my bf (41M) moved together 3 years ago, a year and a half ago I agreed for his sister to move with us so she can work in our town and I agreed for her not to pay anything so she can save money to buy her own house. 

 Coming to today's time, in November we all moved to a house I bought in my name and, before moving, I told my bf his sister can live with us until May and not pay anything but she needs to start looking for a new place. 
 May it's approaching and she still hasn't looked for any new place, insists she wants to buy a house on auction but states she can't get a mortgage and I feel like I have no personal space in my own home because I only have the bedroom I share with my bf and the lounge where there are boxes on top of boxes of his stuff. 

 I want to help but at the same time I feel that now I am being taken advantage off, 1st, if she can afford to look for an auction home she has enough in savings to move (if she does find a house and wins the auction she would have to pay the full price on the spot) but says she can't get a mortgage because she doesn't have enough savings. 

 I told my bf I am hoping she moves soon but it feels like it's all being downplayed and I am not taken seriously. 

So, wibta if I ask her to pay half the mortgage to live here? And to explian, my bf pays bills so, of course  I am not asking him to chip on the monthly mortgage payment as well. "

Earlier on today me and some friends wanted to play some games in the living room, so i took my TV down ( roughly worth ¬£100) and my xbox , and i left them on the stand, one of my housemates tried to plug in the HDMI cable and somehow knocked the TV off of the stand, completely obliterating the screen. 

And just for a bit of back story, last year me and my housemate bought the exact same tv from the exact same shop. 

Initially he said i could have his TV  in replacement so i moved the TV in to the living room, and after we played our games i moved the TV back into my room. 

Now he‚Äôs messaging me asking for it back and saying he will replace mine in 3 weeks time. And i told him that i wasn‚Äôt gonna wait 3 weeks for a replacement, for a TV he broke, when he‚Äôs got the exact same model as me. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA: In-Laws are upset with the name we want to use for our son.,1295,2025-04-02 12:11:44,930,"PLEASE help me and my wife out by letting us know who is the a-hole here:

My wife and I have two boys and are pregnant with our third boy. My wife's brother and his wife (Let's call them Jack and Jill) have a boy as well. After we announced to the family that we were expecting, the two sister-in-laws asked my wife if we had a name in mind via text message.

This is where things get weird IMO. My wife was like ""Yes! We're thinking of naming him Owen"" (Not real name but let's say it is for this sake).  My wife went on to say ""Jill, don't kill us because I know this might add some confusion for y'all!"". Neither sister-in-law replied.

THE REASON it might cause confusion is because on Jill's side of the family (Unrelated to us), they have a nephew named Owen. Note, we have never met this kid, and our families don't cross paths like that.

Jack and Jill are upset and went to my wife's parents before talking to us, telling my wife's parents that they are annoyed and don't want us to name our son Owen because in their mind, ""There's only one Owen in their lives. It would cause confusion for their 1 year old son having two Owen cousins, etc"". We heard from my wife's mom that Jill was going to talk to my wife and discuss this.

Me, being the husband, figured I would just call Jack (my wife's brother) and nip this in the bud. Especially cause my wife was super stressed/discouraged that the name was already causing tension. He couldn't talk until that night so I just sent him this text:

* **""No worries. While \[my wife\] was working out, I just wanted to nip this name thing in the bud. We love you guys, I dont want the drama. But in no way do you guys have a say in what we name our child. A little pissed that I even have to say that out loud.**¬†
* **\[My wife\] was super excited to announce the baby and the name. And now she‚Äôs stressed and there‚Äôs unnecessary tension. \[my wife\] shouldn‚Äôt have to justify/defend naming her own child.**¬† **I know they‚Äôre gonna have a call but there isn‚Äôt room for discussion on it. If we want to name our child whatever name, it‚Äôs ours to make. I hate to add to the tension but you guys put us in this situation and it really sucks.""**

Well that sent off an explosion. They're super hurt by the text, saying how agressive I was. I have already apologized to them for the text and said ""I was just trying to set a boundary, but probably took it too far"", etc. Also, since then, we have been trying to set up a call with them to get past this tension/drama but haven't had any luck.

UPDATE: Would like to know: WIBTA if we end up naming our son ""Owen"""

I felt physically ill. Got all sweaty, and then my 13 y.o. noticed I was crying and repeatedly apologized.

amitheasshole,WIBTA telling my parent-in-law to move back to their home,23,2025-04-03 08:47:59,36,"tl;dr 4 years ago my parent-in-law went to visit me which later become permanent residency at my home. I'm thinking to tell them to go back at their home.

  
**Long Version:**

4 years ago during covid years my parent-in-law went to visit me because me and wife were expecting a baby. Initially I was thinking it's going to be few months stay until we get hang around the baby, turned out they were living permanently with me till today. My retiree father-in-law even find job in second month stay.

My house only have 1 spare bedroom which later occupied by parent-in-law, so I am forced to sleep with toddler son till today.

**The Problem Right Now**

Father-in-law is heavy smoker (like 1-2 packs a day), but what disgusts me the most is he will keep smoking even when my son (or even neighbor's toddler) is around. Dude smoke in 1 meter radius around literal newbon (saw it with my own eyes).

Mother-in-law is helping around the house and cook for the house. But she forced us to live in her way which ended up in us eating her bland / too salty / too earthy food every day. Plus she complains A LOT.

Since it's 2 pair of adults living together there is SO MUCH clutter. I have entire cabinet filled out just to store their tupperware, outdoor desk placed in pathway, house plants more than I can count, and overall random shits they don't want to throw away.

My son is 4 y.o. now, he is around that age where starts asking if he could sleep on his own.

**The Plan**

I just want to tell them ""Hey, can you guys go back to your own house?"", I will pay the transport, me and wife even set up monthly allowance for them.

To me what I'm thinking seems generous enough. But parent-in-law might see it differently, like we hate them so I'm throwing them away. But They already have a decent house in their home town. My current home is just company housing with total strangers around, but in their home town they could have fmaily members nearby. 

Father-in-law thinking he wants to keep working and live with me because their hometown don't have good job market. But dude is literally 72 y.o. this year, last month he was forced to retire again by his employer. Dude, just stay retired and enjoy your life."

amitheasshole,UPDATE WIBTA if I don't give my late bf's house to his parents?,6108,2025-04-02 02:46:22,124,"
Last year I posted a thing here: [WIBTA if I don't give my late bf's house to his parents? : r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ep80wf/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_late_bfs_house_to_his/)

First of all, thanks to all the people who replied and gave me some support, I really appreciate that.

Back when I posted the story, I was in a really bad place and everything was convoluted, I can't tell you how hard it was for me to get to a decision. A lot of people told me to take some time to think about it, but I really want to thank u/MizSaftigJ when I was logging out from reddit back in the day, I saw their response and it lived rent free in my head for almost a week, that helped me decided to take my time before make any decision regarding the house.

So I decided to wait until I felt I was able to think clearly. It took me a few months; it was hard, his parents kept bothering me with calls and emails about the house, they even hired a lawyer to talk to me about it, but my own lawyer told them all to fuck off, they hadn't any leg to stand on if that would have gone to a judge. 

Back in January I finally felt able to make any decision, I told them that I was going to sell them the house for the original price my BF bought it, I would still lost some money but was the best course of action for me, and that that was my last offer. They refuse it, telling that I should be a better person and let them get the house for less (they didn't even dare to call me his boyfriend, just a ""person""), so I decided to put the house on the market.

Back in February they reached out to me again, asking if my proposal was still on the table, I would have loved to tell them no but I know my BF wanted them to live there, so I told them yes but they had to decided within a week, it wasn't necessary, they accepted right away. So I let my lawyer handled the selling, I didn't want to see them no more; I got surprised when my lawyer handled me a photobook of him as kid and pre-teen, looks like it was their way of trying to acknowledge their son's life. Is the only thing for what I'm grateful for to them.

A few weeks ago was my BF's one year memorial, they didn't show up, so I can move on with my life without them bothering me no more.

Thanks again for all the comments and DM, you guys are awesome."
amitheasshole,AITAH for unhooking the heater because my GF keeps turning the thermostat to 85¬∞F?,2686,2025-04-02 06:37:33,410,"My GF and I have been living and traveling in an RV for about 3 years now, and we use a space heater and propane furnace. For whatever reason this past winter she's been cranking the space heater to 85¬∞F and leaving it on, no matter what the temperature is inside or outside. I was OK with it during the winter cold because it would be 30¬∞F outside and the space heater could never get the RV up that high if it tried. But now it's spring and it does get that hot inside. I've asked her multiple times nicely to put it at 70¬∞F, or even 75¬∞F, but she keeps cranking it. I've also firmly told her to stop. She refuses to wear hoodies and sweatxpants/PJs, and insists on only wearing underwear at home. I'm fairly certain she doesn't know how a thermostat works, and I tried explaining it to her. I'll get home and it's 80 something degrees, so I'll turn it off, and she'll just crank it back up when I'm not looking. I'll turn it off at night, and she'll turn it back early AM when she notices. I'm over it.

So, tonight, a few minutes ago, I took the heater and hid it in storage. I unhooked the propane to the furnace and removed the fuse to the furnace. It's 50¬∞F outside, but still 75¬∞F inside the RV. I know we're about to have a fight in two hours or so. AITAH? Idk what to do."
amitheasshole,AITA for kicking out my Siblings best friend,2,2025-04-03 21:35:43,14,"This just happened yesterday and I'm feeling conflicted.  
My Siblings best friend moved in with us about 3 years ago and over the last year things have been getting increasingly worse.

When we all first moved in together we all were working and everyone paid their fair portion of the bills and everyone was getting along well. Then about a year ago the friend lost their job and we were still in an okay spot financially so my wife and I agreed we would give them plenty of time to find a new job because they have pretty heavy autism and dissociation problems so it can be really hard for them to find / keep a job. 

over the last 5-6 months things have gotten rather difficult around the house financially because I lost my job due to a medical condition ""emergency Ostomy"". My Sibling also Quit their job because they couldn't handle the stress of work  anymore. Due to the drop in income we have fallen behind on bills which led to me getting a 3 day disconnection notice on the electric bill. 

I brought this to my sibling and their friends attention and was met with an uncaring response of ""well we aren't working so...."" 
I asked them to see if they could reach out and ask their boyfriends or anyone else they knew if they could help just so we don't lose our power. 
The friend called their brother and he was willing to give a Loan to us, but they turned him down when I told them ""sure but it will be your responsibility to pay him back as you are home 24/7 and use electricity""  
They proceeded to tell Their brother "" nevermind, he won't be able to pay you back because he already has trouble paying people back "" and when I asked them why they couldn't have taken responsibility and pay him back I was told ""well I don't believe that it's my responsibility""  which sent my blood pressure through the roof. 

* I also know they could have paid their brother back with no issue because they do online commissions and have acted as an 'Escort' in order to buy things They want so it's not like I was asking the impossible * 

I left the house and gave myself about an hour to collect and calm myself down. When I got back home I sat down with them and explained why they have to move and gave them 2 weeks to pack up.  When they told my Sibling what was going on they decided they're going to move with them which honestly hurts because we had such a great bond growing up and until all this started happening. 


Sorry for the long post / rant but,
AITA for finally breaking and kicking this person out? 



/EDIT

I'll accept that I am an asshole for the end result but theres more context to the story I'd like to provide. 

First off for easy reading, both the sibling and their friend are She/they so I'll use (S) for sibling and (F) for their friend. 

with the bill situation overall, the wife and I already have a plan in place but Life happens and we needed help with just this one thing ""which is already resolved and the bill is paid""  
Even after my emergency surgery I worked for another 3 months and ended up with a parastomal hernia that weighs a little over 7lbs at this point. After my work let me go on 'medical leave, unpaid if course' I started doing ride shares to cover as much as I could so it wouldn't all be on my wife, so we are both working 8-10 hours a day and they are both home by themselves all day. 

I know (F) still have some kind of income because they can afford to take My car and go out to dinner every other night or go to the mall / movies whenever they want. But they absolutely refuse to help with the house and expect my wife and I to cradle them, we even pay their phone bills and phone payments. 

Back in December we all sat down and came to an agreement that while we all love each other we are terrible roommates and there was a mutual time of 6 months for them to find jobs and be able to get on their feet to move properly. Since then I have come to find out that neither one of them has even been filling out applications. So this wasn't sprung on them out of nowhere. 

Even before jobs were lost they both behave like high schoolers even though they are both in their 20's. (S) blew the engine in their car so I put them on my insurance and allowed them to use my car. After they came home DRUNK on their (F)'s birthday I asked them to install the drive wise app from my insurance so I can track where my car is going and they responded with aggression because they know it tracks how they drive as well ""speed hard brakes ect"" and they don't want that. They also got a speeding ticket for going 98 mph in their friends boyfriends car so I can't trust them not to do the same in mine. Then in the household they constantly cook only for themselves and leave the mess for my wife or I and if we say anything or ask them to take care of their dishes we get a heavy sigh and a Fine whatever, then it still doesn't get done. I can't even use my own TV in the living room because one of them will hook up their laptops and then throw a fit if anyone else wants to use it. I can't even have friends come over because (F) will constantly make side comments until they leave. 
We all have our own rooms but (F) has turned their room into a storage unit and only use it to sleep, otherwise they take over the living room. 

Even with all that has happened I don't want my Sibling to move because they are all I have left in my blood family. We grew up in a very toxic environment and they are the only one I have any love left for. but I know that they are going to side with them and I have to accept that. "

amitheasshole,AITA for not telling my friend that my our friends were going to the mall.,0,2025-04-04 00:56:59,4,"Okay so I have this friend we met in the sixth grade and now have gotten really close these past years. 

Yesterday one of my friends we‚Äôll call him Josh. He texted me while I was taking a nap, I wasn‚Äôt really asleep yet so I decided to answer. He asked me if I could go to the mall today and I said I couldn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt have nobody to pick me up or drop me off. So he said it was okay and that it was last minute so it was alright. I then asked him if our two other friends were going, we‚Äôll call them Rose and Chloe. He told me that he was asking Rose right now (it was confirmed Chloe was going) I said okay so after that I went back to sleep.

Fast forward to when I woke up a couple hours later Rose texted me and asked me if I had seen Chloe and Josh‚Äôs stories on Instagram I said no. So I went to go check and it was just a bunch of pictures of them at the mall together so in my head I was like okay I knew they were going so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Rose then was getting mad at how they didn‚Äôt invite us and she was just going off on them, I was confused because I had thought Josh had asked so I said ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt they ask you?‚Äù. She then started going off on Josh. I guess then she realized that I knew and I was invited so then she said ‚ÄúOh u knew‚Äù. I already knew she was mad because I could tell by the way she was texting, so I started apologizing and explaining how I took a nap and didn‚Äôt think to tell her because I thought Josh had asked her. Couple minutes after that Chloe texted in our group chat with me, Rose, and Josh, she just started apologizing about the plans and how they were last minute. But the thing that stood out to me was that Chloe said that she had texted Rose about the plans and Josh also had texted her to pull up, the thing is that Rose left them both on seen and didn‚Äôt say anything so I didn‚Äôt know why she was going off on them and saying she didn‚Äôt get invited. I then went to go check Rose and I‚Äôs messages and I sent another apology, she hadn‚Äôt responded. I then was left on delivered for an hour. I just don‚Äôt understand if she has a right to be mad or not. With her leaving me on delivered for an hour she made me worry and I felt really bad about the whole thing. Another thing Josh had texted me about it and I decided to tell him how I was worried and concerned about how she was mad at me (I wasn‚Äôt  talking shit I was just venting). Josh then plainly texted Rose ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Rose‚Äù, he then told me that she responded and had an attitude with him and was just going off. So let me know because im just really worried about it."
amitheasshole,AITA for calling my mom out for being a liar in front of our entire family?,3646,2025-04-02 04:27:37,230,"Throwaway.

I (20F) have been living at school for the past year, about a 45-minute drive from home. I have a scholarship that lets me live on campus. At home, I live with my mom (47F), dad (45M), and older half-sister (25F), who visits often.

Recently, my mom‚Äôs side of the family started a tradition of brunch at my aunt‚Äôs house every other Sunday, including:

- My parents  
- Sister & her toddler  
- My aunt (mom‚Äôs older sister) & uncle  
- My cousins (around my age)
- My other aunt (mom‚Äôs younger sister)
- My grandparents  

Since the brunches started, I‚Äôve been coming home on Saturdays and staying until 5 PM on Sunday.

My mom‚Äôs known for her baking, but most people don‚Äôt realize she mostly uses boxed mixes. She‚Äôs great at decorating, but when people compliment her desserts, it‚Äôs usually about the look, not the taste. I don‚Äôt mind boxed desserts, but I prefer baking from scratch. I‚Äôve been baking from scratch for a couple of years, and I love it.

I typically bake homemade cookies or cupcakes the night before brunch while my parents are out. My mom always brings a boxed cake she decorates. She‚Äôs never had an issue with me baking until recently.

A month ago, I brought homemade cookies to brunch, and everyone loved them. My older cousin‚Äôs girlfriend even asked for the recipe! But my mom casually mentioned, ‚ÄúIf only you knew the mess she left behind after making those.‚Äù Everyone laughed, but I felt bad. I‚Äôm clumsy, so I thought maybe I missed a spot and apologized for giving her extra work.

Two weekends ago, I used tablecloths to protect the countertops while I baked, but my mom made the same comment that Sunday. That‚Äôs when I started to suspect she was exaggerating, so I decided to test it.

This Saturday, I baked the cookies at my best friend‚Äôs house and brought them home in a container. I hadn‚Äôt touched anything at my house.

When Sunday came, my mom made the same comment about me leaving a mess. I snapped. I was angry, so I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you tired of making shit up to make me look bad? I know you‚Äôre lying because I didn‚Äôt even bake these here this week.‚Äù I told everyone I baked them at my friend‚Äôs house. Silence. My mom threw a tantrum all day, saying I was disrespectful and now everyone would think of her as the ‚Äúmom with the mouthy daughter.‚Äù

Afterward, my sister texted me saying I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything in front of everyone. My aunt (mom‚Äôs younger sister) messaged me saying my mom does a lot for me and I shouldn‚Äôt have made it awkward. I told them I was tired of being publicly embarrassed by my mom and that no one ever calls her out. This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs embarrassed me or my sister, and I feel like she gets satisfaction from it. Honestly, I suspect she‚Äôs jealous that people like my desserts more than hers.

Now I‚Äôm second-guessing myself. Maybe I should‚Äôve addressed it privately instead of calling her out in front of everyone. So, AITA for calling my mom out in front of the family?"
amitheasshole,AITA for yelling at my friend for breaking into my phone?,44,2025-04-03 04:02:19,9,"The other week I was texting this guy I like and this girl who I'm kinda friends with snatches my phone from my hands and reads the text i just sent: ""R u going to be at church today?"" 

She immediately knew that it was someone from church and because of the contact photo she kinda had an idea of who he was, and since i  had him labeled as ""Heartbreaker ‚ù§Ô∏èüòàü´∂üèª"" in my contacts (because ik there's absolutely zero chance that he would ever really like me back), she's immediately like ""Ooooooh who broke your heart????"". Since she had my phone in her hand she sends a message (from ""me"") saying: ""Heyyyy I like youuu"" 

I had no idea she sent that, but when i get my phone back (about five minutes later), i see the text and go ABSOLUTELY BALLISTIC. i have to quickly sort it out by saying that the other girl sent it, but idk if he believed me. 

I confronted the girl (she's 14 and I'm 16) an tell her what she did was wrong and told her how mad i was at her, but she kinda brushed it off as nothing but a ""joke"".

Now, idk about everyone else, but BREAKING INTO MY PHONE AND TEXTING SOMEONE ISNT A ""JOKE"". 

I ended up screaming at her and them icing her out for the rest of the 6-hour day. I kinda think she deserved it, but another part of me thinks that maybe i overreacted? "
amitheasshole,AITA for moving out and leaving my dad alone while most of my family is in a different country?,608,2025-04-02 13:28:11,154,"I (21F) recently graduated college with a bachelor's and have been looking for full-time work in my field. Soon after my graduation, my family planned to leave the country to visit relatives and sell our parents' house, with the intention of leaving the United States all together. I chose not to go with them, as I'd rather live in the US and don't get along well with our family in the other country. My dad (67M) decided to stay with me.

While I've been searching for a full-time job, I worked as a cashier earning a decent but not livable wage. I have my own bank account, but my parents have control over it and can add/withdraw funds whenever they want. This is the same with my sister (22F) and brother (19M). A few weeks after my family arrived in the new country, I noticed the majority of the money I'd earned had been taken out of my account. I asked my mom (57F) if she took it and she suggested that we hold a family meeting about finances. I agreed, and we arraigned for a time that would work for the whole family.

During this conversation, I asked if I could keep every other paycheck or a minimum amount from each paycheck so that I could pay off student loans and save up to eventually move out. I won't get into the details of the interaction, as I don't think a lot of it is relevant, but things became heated and my mom made it clear she wouldn't allow it. After the conversation, my dad tried to console me and figure out a way to resolve things. We agreed to have another call to sort things out.

During the second conversation, I restated that I wanted to keep some, not all, of my paycheck so that I could save up money. I didn't mention moving out, as I believed that was the thing that made my mom upset last time. My siblings, mom, and dad made it clear that I wouldn't be able to keep my paychecks and that they would instead go towards paying off the money my family spent on my college education. Afterwards, my parents would continue to take my paychecks, but that I would be able to ask for the amount back if I wanted to buy a car, pay for my wedding, etc. They assured me they would keep track of the amount that they took.

I ended the conversation as calmly as I could, but I felt trapped. My partner (20M) had previously said that he had made plans if I needed to leave home in a hurry, and I told him I needed to leave that night. It's been a month since then, and I've been slowly building a life in a different state. I have control over my finances, a full-time job in my field, and a support system. I don't regret moving, but I'm worried I made the wrong decision by leaving my dad home alone, especially since he's in his sixties. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITAH for refusing to deep clean?,6,2025-04-03 16:31:13,66,"
Before I get into the issue, I will give context. My fianc√©e (f25) and I (f24) currently live together. We both work full time jobs. She works a labor job (12-14hour days, 11 am - 11 pm) and I work an office job (8 hours a day, 8am -4pm) I‚Äôm also a full time student (4-5 online classes a semester.)

Since she‚Äôs gone most of the time, I have taken on the responsibility of most of the domestic labor. I do 95% of the cooking, laundry, dishes, care for our 6 animals (ferrets cats and a dog), making sure the house is presentable and more, while she comes home, eats and goes to bed.

Here‚Äôs where I MBTAH. We got into a huge argument where she brought up how I need to be deep cleaning more often. Her stance is that it‚Äôs disgusting not to deep clean, and deep cleaning needs to be done daily (not the whole house, but pick one area and deep cleaning) I agree with her, but my argument is that I don‚Äôt have time, and if she helped me pick up the little things, then I would. After I‚Äôm done with everything, I have limited time to study, and my grades are tanking hard. I‚Äôm unbelievably stressed as it is, to the point I don‚Äôt have time to take care of myself because I‚Äôm focused on caring. She says that I have the time and energy that she doesn‚Äôt have because she works a labor job and I just work a desk job, but mentally, I‚Äôm beyond exhausted. I explained this to her, but she doesn‚Äôt see my side and just thinks I‚Äôm lazy.

We‚Äôve talked about this, her solution is that I do all the deep cleaning so she can relax on her days off because she‚Äôs tired and needs rest. I agree that she does because she works hard, but when do I get to rest? If I do take leisure time for myself, it‚Äôs usually met with criticism (if you had time for that, why not this?) but I can‚Äôt spend every second of my waking life working, learning, cleaning, and taking care of everyone, im going crazy, especially since what I do isn‚Äôt respected.

Currently, I‚Äôm paying all the bills and she is paying off her debt, (she paid my debt as well, I had about 4k and she has about 26k) don‚Äôt have the budget for a maid. Keep in mind, we also share a car, so I‚Äôm not getting more than 6 hours of sleep a night so I‚Äôm also exhausted. Idk what to do, and I can‚Äôt talk to her about it. Am I the asshole and just being a big baby about this?"
amitheasshole,AITA for having beef with my project partner?,3,2025-04-03 17:54:50,12,"So we had a presentation project on breast cancer, I (15f) was originally gonna work alone but another girl (14f) asked me to work on the slides together, so I reluctantly agreed and sat with her. We were working pretty good for the first day or 2, I did have to keep consistently fixing her slides since a lot of them didn't look how they were supposed to, but it was fine.

After 1 or 2 days of working, I had to miss like 2 days of school, and I was *expecting* her to at least get SOME slides done, and then I would fix them when I returned. Came back to school 2 days later, I sat down in class and asked her if she made any progress. She nods, and goes back to her phone. I'm a bit skeptical, so I open my computer. NOTHING was done. NO new slides. And presentation day was TODAY. I wanted to cry. I didn't say anything, and instead started frantically adding slides and finishing things when it was our turn.

And when it was, the presentation was horrible. She wasnt making eye contact, reading directly off the screen AND was throwing me off too! It was over, the teacher had put in the grade. C+.

You may think that's not bad but when you have a mother with extremely high expectations just know youre cooked bro </3

Later at lunch, I was just steaming mad and lowkey on the edge of a breakdown cus I had already been having a shitty week, and she comes up to me and says ""Hey I think we did pretty okay on the presentation, I'm happy with my grade and I think I did a good job"" NOT... REALLY..... :,(

  
I came THIS.. CLOSE.. to exploding at her, but instead I just ignored her and walked away. AITA for being mad at her? because one of my friends told me that maybe I could've done the project from home which is FAIR, but idk you guys tell me"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding because of her choice of suits for the groomsmen?,0,2025-04-03 23:47:41,129,"Hey Reddit, I‚Äôm in a bit of a family pickle here and could use some outside opinions.

My sister ""Emma"" (30F) is getting married in June, and naturally, I (28M) was thrilled for her. We‚Äôve always been pretty close, so I was honored when she asked me to be one of the groomsmen. However, things have taken a turn for the bizarre.

Emma has a unique fashion sense, and while it‚Äôs her wedding and her vision, the outfits she‚Äôs chosen for the groomsmen are, well, let‚Äôs just say *unusual*. We‚Äôre supposed to wear these bright teal suits with floral ties and flashy pocket squares that look like they‚Äôre straight off a Hawaiian shirt. The whole ensemble is something you‚Äôd expect to see at a tropical-themed party rather than a wedding.

I brought up my discomfort about wearing the suit, suggesting a few alternatives that might fit the overall theme without being so over-the-top, but Emma dismissed all my suggestions. She‚Äôs adamant that these suits are non-negotiable because they fit her ‚Äúdream look.‚Äù

I‚Äôm usually up for some fashion risks, but these suits make me feel awkward, and frankly, a bit like a walking punchline. I told Emma that maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be in the wedding party if the suit made me that uncomfortable.

She got upset, saying I‚Äôm making this about me and that I‚Äôm being selfish. Our parents think I should just suck it up for the day to support her. But I‚Äôm struggling with the idea of being forced into something so far out of my comfort zone.

So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to wear the suit and potentially not attending my sister‚Äôs wedding?"
amitheasshole,WIBTAH if I didn‚Äôt attend my pinning ceremony?,25,2025-04-03 06:18:09,21,"I am currently a vet tech student and myself and my 8 class mates are set to graduate in May. We started with ~25 students, and only 8 of us made the cut. We are so proud of ourselves and each other. Most of us are planning to walk at graduation. Where I'm from, it is also customary to hold a pinning ceremony for those graduating from healthcare programs. Those held for nurses for humans are most well known, but vet techs have one too. At my school, the previous pinning ceremonies have been organized and planned completely by the 2 instructors and their students, so it is a very emotional and personal ceremony, it isn't public like graduation.

However, this year the school got a new president. He has decided that, for some ungodly reason, he must attend every pinning ceremony, for EVERY ALLIED HEALTH PROGRAM. In order to make this work, he has mandated that different programs have to do their pinning ceremonies TOGETHER. This means strangers we never met are now a part of it, we can no longer pick a time that works for us, and we can't hold a tradition of previous classes where our instructor plays a slideshow of pictures of us as we progressed. To say my class is pissed is an understatement. We tried everything we could to undo this change but we were ignored. We let it go after a little bit, until recently.

We were just updated and told that we are now mandated to wear our school issued scrubs. While normally this wouldn't be a big deal (and is actually quite common) it was the straw that broke the camel's back for us. We talked as a class, got some strong feels out, and elected a class representative to speak to the director of allied health to try and get this undone, and maybe even speak to the president of the school.

Multiple classmates of mine are saying they will not attend the pinning ceremony if things aren't changed. I agreed with this. However, my parents are nurses (had their own pinning ceremony) and they think my class is overreacting, and that no one should skip a pinning ceremony regardless because of it's symbolism (the vet tech/nurses oath is recited). However, the pinning ceremony in nursing is very serious and has a rich history, and the vet tech one does not to my knowledge. This is why I have no problem skipping it, but my parents still don't agree. On top of that, one of my classmates can't back out bc she has family flying in specifically for the pinning ceremony. So basically, WIBTAH if I didn't go? Should my class just suck it up? I really feel unsure."
amitheasshole,AITA for making a FB post asking for counselors in the area for my husband?,0,2025-04-03 23:16:14,14,"I tried posting anonymous on the FB group, and they said I had to post as myself. I gave context about my husband having an addiction, I'm neglected, and on the verge of divorcing him while having no family or friends in the area he has us in. My post was asking for counselors not only for him but for myself as well in the area. Someone made a comment saying it was probably my fault, and I replied that my husband doesn't even talk to me or have dinner with me. He is out with friends and whatnot with the only vehicle while I've already started having labor contractions. I said I doubt his friends even know he's married with a baby on the way with how he always mutes the phone/mic and spends all of his time with them. Plus he doesn‚Äôt come home until 1AM and is on the phone with a guy friend he went out with, then immediately plays games with that same friend without greeting me or anything.  

Well, apparently one of my husband's friends happened to be in that group. I didn't know because my husband has his friends list hidden on FB. His friend sent screenshots of my post and comment. My husband said I was slandering him because now people think he's a bad guy. He was mad I made a post and also that I didn't post anonymously. I told him I tried posting anonymously but also nothing I said wasn't true. And the point of the post was to ask for counselors/advice since that's what the group is for. He said I should talk to him about that stuff and not others on FB. I said I have for over 8 months and nothing came of it. I have cried, I have begged, and nothing has changed. I didn't want to go straight for a divorce, so I was reaching out for help. 

Now he's moping around the house. I never ask anyone for advice or put info on FB about my personal life. But I'm at a point where I honestly feel trapped in my marriage and don't know what to do. I have no one but myself for support and don't make enough to pay for this house, bills, etc and save to leave to another place while also having to buy everything for the baby and pay out of pocket for medical. He was completely different before marriage and planning for this baby. I'm the only one working, cleaning, etc. I made the post because I've been upset since I ended up in the ER pushing myself too hard trying to do everything on my own. I've dealt with perinatal depression for months by myself because he said I'm the pregnant one, so he can't help since it doesn't affect him. I didn't even get counselor recommendations because his friend sent him screenshots immediately, and he told me to delete it before more of his friends see. Now I'm wondering if I should have just stayed quiet like I have been all these months and never made the post. I feel like I should apologize, but at the same time I didn't lie about anything and genuinely just wanted help. "
amitheasshole,AITA for opening up my husbands mortgage letters?,136,2025-04-02 20:37:43,64,"AITA for opening up a letter from my husband‚Äôs mortgage lender? He bought the house before we were married, and due to my credit at the time I couldn‚Äôt be on the loan. Plus we had only been dating for close to 2 years. We‚Äôve been best friends for a decade and married for a few years. 

I contribute all of my paycheck to our shared bills, but he makes 3 times as much as I do. We were doing weekly budget dates until he fully went into sales. After that, his paychecks were large enough that I would just send my part and he said he‚Äôd take care of any payments. During that time we went on numerous vacations and even adopted families for Christmas that were affected by a natural disaster. Spending money left and right. 

Skip to 02/2025, and I finally opened a letter since we were getting so many. Every time one would come in, he would say he paid for it and not to worry. I don‚Äôt pry, but the volume of letters we were receiving was astronomical. I opened the letter to find out we haven‚Äôt had a payment go through since September of 2024. He said it wasn‚Äôt right and that he‚Äôd call. Two weeks later I asked again, he said he did call and they said it was taken care of. 

Next thing you know we‚Äôre getting certified mail that we are heading towards foreclosure. At this point we‚Äôre 7 months behind on payments and we qualified for a lien instead of foreclosure. Something to celebrate in comparison to losing our home.

Jumping ahead‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt yell, I definitely cried but I just said he was smarter than that. How could he not see the money not coming out? Or not seeing any type of confirmation? Anytime I brought up our bills he‚Äôd just say it was taken care of. 

Well, apparently I‚Äôm not allowed to be mad at the situation. That it was taken care of now and he will pay back the lien and I can‚Äôt mention it without him getting offended. I‚Äôm not even mad about the payments, shoot I have ADHD and this is something I could have done in my past. I‚Äôm angry about the lying. AITA for wanting an apology? I feel like I‚Äôve been extremely supportive while holding him accountable but am I being too harsh? "
amitheasshole,AITA For refusing to clean up after my father?,6,2025-04-03 14:22:43,13,"(F22) For some context I'm currently living at home while I go to school, rent free. While I was unemployed, as exchange for living at home I was expected to do all of the house work. The issue is that I went from having my siblings to help me to being the only person in the home to clean at all. I was doing  on average, about 2.5 hours of house work by myself, everyday. I've become a bit sensitive to it. That lasted about 6 or 7 months. Now I am employed and I clean up after myself. Recently, my father has put an extra emphasis on not helping me any of my housework. If I have clothes in the laundry and the load finishes before I realize, he'll have me change it, even if it means waiting instead of just switching it. I've always just changed the laundry. He got a new dog that he berates and has no patience for but because my schedule leaves me home most of the day (I work nights) I'm the one taking care of the dog. Now I don't really mind this. I'm an adult. I can, should, and do, clean up after myself. But last night I came home around midnight, and I found a huge mess in the kitchen. He and his girlfriend have been cooking more at home lately and they left pretty much the entire mess on the counter. Wrappers from the food, food smeared on the counter, and a sink full of dishes. This morning he called me and asked if I could clean it for him. the conversation went something like this:

""Hey I need you to clean the kitchen today""  
""Wait- Didn't you guys leave a huge mess on the counter?""

""It's not a huge mess, You live here rent free, I pay for everything, you cant just clean the fucking kitchen?""

It escalated to a point where he said I would now be paying rent. I guess I'm fine with this. I've been saving up to pay for college in August, something I'm supporting myself through alone and paying rent would make that more difficult, but I can make it work. We've had this conversation a couple times where he asks me to clean up after a mess he's made and I've asked how much he wants for rent. But I have to know, am I the asshole for refusing to clean? I told him that it makes me feel like I'm his maid. Even the other night he made the family get together and watch a movie, he got up multiple times, but when I got up to put my plate away he had me toss his and grab him a beer. It felt pointed, especially because my younger sister had also gotten up and he didn't ask her to do anything, he waited for me. His girlfriend even offered to do it herself, be he told her that ""She's got it."" I don't know, I feel like I'm going crazy. Am I just over reacting? I'm the only one he treats this way. I understand that I'm lucky he's letting me live here, but I thought I'd try standing up for myself and this happens. Am I the Asshole?"

Hey ! So I was late to school again so mom decided to create more trauma for my book <33

So she was rightfully mad about that right?
But when she told me to go take a quick shower I went into the bathroom to do so. Then she came into the bathroom and told me she doesn‚Äôt trust me to be fast enough and that she‚Äôs going to watch me shower. Fist of all, WHAT. THE. FU‚Ç¨K?! Who does that ?? It‚Äôs just creepy, gross and invasive. It‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre my mother that it gives you the right to do that. I‚Äôm non-binary and very disphoric about my ‚Äúfeminine features‚Äù so in no world I‚Äôm changing in front of her.

Then left me alone to clean and change. After a moment I got up and came to my room to change. Then, (not fully clothed yet) I blocked my door hearing her coming back to protect myself.

amitheasshole,AITA for (maybe) ruining my friendship with one of my best friends,0,2025-04-03 22:48:36,2,"I (18F) had a close friendship with my (former?) best friend A (18F). We are part of a larger friend group, which also includes her best friend E (18F), and the three of us spent a lot of time together. But now everything is ruined, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my fault.

It started last year when A told me that she and our mutual friend B had a thing for each other, but she didn‚Äôt want anything serious with him. A little later, I developed a crush on him and sent her a voice message (she was away from home for a while) asking if she would be okay with me trying to see if something could happen between me and B. I made it clear that our friendship was way more important to me than any guy and that I would drop it immediately if she was uncomfortable. She got really angry because she said it was already bad enough that I even had the thought. We had a huge fight but eventually made up. E said she understood both sides but, of course, sided with her best friend (which I get).

Then, A, E, and I went to another city together and stayed at a friend‚Äôs place. Another friend (C) was there too, and A found him attractive. She was flirting with another friend of our host, so I ended up talking to C. But A saw it as me flirting with him, which I didn‚Äôt do (at least not intentionally) and got mad at me (although I didnt know about that till today). Later, I mentioned that I found D (a guy from our skate community whom she had a thing with) attractive. At first, she said she couldn‚Äôt see herself in a relationship with him and even thought he would be a better fit for me. She was unsure, though, because she still liked him. Later, she told me this was one of the reasons why she ended our friendship. I did try flirting with him once (which was actually her idea), but I quickly realized he wasn‚Äôt interested, so I dropped it immediately. Today she told me that the way I acted in those 3 situations wasnt okay.
I sometimes have difficulties reading social cues so im not sure if I missed something back then

A little while ago, we had a conversation with her best friend E, where they told me the things about me that bothered them so we could find solutions. One of the main issues was that I sometimes say or do things without thinking. I apologized and explained that this is due to my ADHD, but I‚Äôm actively working on it and never do it on purpose. They pointed out other issues as well, which I also acknowledged and had already been trying to improve. I understand that these things affected them, and I get why they needed space.

Then A told me she needed space from me. I accepted that. But yesterday, I went skating and sat down with two people I knew‚ÄîF and G. The problem: F is A‚Äôs crush. I asked them if I could sit with them because I didn‚Äôt want to sit alone. They didn‚Äôt mind, and F even started some conversations with me. We only made small talk and talked about skating. Other than that, I was reading or skating. Still, the next morning, A told me that there would be serious drama if I didn‚Äôt stay away from F. Later that night, she said I should stop going to the skatepark altogether and that if I said anything more than ‚Äúhi‚Äù to F or G, there would be even bigger issues. She also told me not to come near her anymore‚Äî‚Äúfor my own good.‚Äù

Now, I feel completely broken. She was one of my best friends. We‚Äôre in the same class and friend group, and now everything is destroyed. I know I made mistakes, but I feel like she‚Äôs being extremely controlling, especially when it comes to guys. At the same time, I‚Äôm scared that this is just a defense mechanism on my part and that I‚Äôm actually the one at fault.

So, AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not being patient enough for my friend,1,2025-04-03 22:27:46,7,"Last december, I found myself caught between two friends, Mia and Jess, in a way I never expected. The three of us had been tight since college‚Äîmovie nights, late-night talks, the works. But things started shifting when Mia got a new boyfriend. She‚Äôd flake on plans constantly, always with some half-baked excuse about how he needed her. I tried to be understanding‚Äîlove makes you dumb sometimes, right? But after the fifth time, I snapped. Over text, I told Mia she was being a shitty friend and that I was done chasing her. She fired back, calling me selfish for not supporting her happiness. It stung, but I stopped replying. 

Jess, though, was still there. She didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it: ‚ÄúMia‚Äôs checked out. You don‚Äôt owe her your patience.‚Äù So, I leaned into Jess instead. We started hanging out more, just the two of us‚Äîhiking, coffee runs, laughing about how we‚Äôd outlasted the drama. It felt good, like I‚Äôd traded chaos for something solid. Mia noticed, though. She‚Äôd post cryptic stuff about ‚Äúfake friends‚Äù abandoning her, and mutuals started asking why I‚Äôd ‚Äúditched‚Äù her.

I still wonder if I‚Äôm the asshole here. Was I too harsh, cutting Mia off like that? Or was it fair to pick Jess and move on when Mia stopped showing up? Jess says I did what I had to, but those posts haunt me. Maybe I could‚Äôve tried harder‚Äîor maybe I just saved myself. "
amitheasshole,AITA for buying colored contacts without my parents permission?,4,2025-04-03 16:26:24,23,"I (16F) have saved some money not a long time ago cause I was thinking of buying colored contact lenses myself as my parents won't let me get them because they think I'm too young for them. Since my debit card is connected to my dads account, I asked him to deposit the money that I saved to my card and he did it.(i still didn't tell them that i will buy contacts) So I did my research about contacts of course, then I took a look of an online contact lens website that everyone trusts and loves in my country. I saw the website was open for debit card use so I used my debit card and ordered them.(they said that it will come in a 1 week) So 2 days later, after I've already bought them both of my parents freaked out. They screamed at me and grounded me. I apologized them but they didn't forgive me. It seems like they have canceled my order. I really don't know what to say cause it was my first time buying something online with my own money and my parents still won't talk to me. I feel really sorry and I'm %100 sure that I'm the biggest AH here but I also want to know the others opinion. AITA?"
amitheasshole,"AITA for asking a friend if SHE understands wedding courtesy, or else she can't bring her 4 year old son (who is on the spectrm) .",2906,2025-04-02 03:01:52,251,"I feel like there are 2 types of parents in this world. The first type of parent goes: ""I won't be raising a little shit."" The second type of parent goes, ""The world should revolve around my perfect angel.""

I myself have the 'tism and so do most of the people I socialize with, and this goes double for us. And I have noticed a huge difference in outcomes for kids who were raised by Parent Type 1 vs. Parent Type 2. 

The vast majority of my friends with kids are Type 1 parents. That's why I have absolutely no problem with having kids at my wedding. Because I know they will prevent their kids from being disruptive during the serious parts, and not just let them loose as hellions during the fun parts. 

I have ONE friend who is a type 2 parent, and I really feel for her son because he is going to face a lot of social rejection when he gets older. He is probably one of the most spoiled, inconsiderate children I have ever met, but it's really not his fault. My friend his mother is adamant that he should NEVER have to be considerate of others, and all adults and children should just accommodate all his whims and be ""understanding.""

So I don't hold it against him even though he's awful to be around, because it's truly not his fault. Nobody has ever taught him how to act in any form of interpersonal interaction. 

That being said, I really don't want him at my wedding, but I cringe at the idea of singling my friend out as the only person whose child can't come. And she certainly will want him to come, she doesn't go anywhere without him. 

The problem is I could see her handing him an iPad and having him play games on it at full volume during the entire ceremony and find it outrageous if anyone has an issue with it, because her son ""needs"" it and can't tolerate headphones. There are a number of things like that which I could see her doing or allowing.   
  
I wanted to broach the subject with her but not be insulting towards her son. The way I approached it was trying to get at whether or not SHE understands wedding etiquette. Such as not playing loud videos during the ceremony. I just wanted to figure out if there would be any issues, but apparently this approach made me an asshole according to her. "
amitheasshole,AITA for making mean comments to my friends after they tried to sneak onto our holiday?,1,2025-04-03 22:08:10,13,"Half of our group (Group A) decided to go on a holiday and the other half (Group B) decided they did not want to go. So Group A went away and decided to book this holiday to tenerife. The day after the booking was confirmed and payed we found out one person from Group A went and added Group B to our holiday behind our back and did not invite our other friend from our friend group that decided they wanted to go aswell. Group B also are paying a significant amount less and screwing up our room situation. Where previously we were in rooms of two, we are now being forced into the same rooms as before but with an extra person each, bringing sofa beds into the equation. They decided to try and hide their addition to the booking for as long as possible. Obviously when the secret was revealed, our group (Group A) was mad and in the heat of the moment we may have responded with some attitude and aggression, including making comme ts about their itteligence, mental capacity, and ability to understand a situation. Group B are not owning up to a single thing they did wrong and keep adding lies to their excuses. I was the bigger person and tried to make an apology to which Group B scrolled on there phones and ignored what I said. This made me very upset and I believe they are acting like children.

amitheasshole,AITA for washing my hands by the trash can?,5,2025-04-03 11:57:12,24,"I go to a small temple near my home sometimes. After praying, all the devotees are served dinner.

I come from a culture/religion where people typically eat with their hands. There are curries, gravies, and other things that get your hands dirty. We are given a napkin but that is not enough to properly clean our hands and mouths. 

Get this - there is no bathroom or sink in the temple premises. None of the nearby stores have a bathroom. I feel like I would be the asshole if I went to a nearby restaurant to use their bathroom without buying anything. The train station that I go to to come back home has a bathroom but that bathroom closes pretty early.

So in order to properly wash my hands after eating, I usually get a cup of water from a water filter near the trash can, open the trash can with my foot (there is a pedal to open it), and then pour water over my hands, with the water flowing into the trash can. I then use an extra napkin to dry my hands and get rid of any remaining residue. Once I reach home, I use soap to wash my hands nicely.

Up until yesterday, no one seemed to care that I was washing my hands this way. But yesterday, a volunteer at the temple seemed a bit disgusted or I guess he had a disapproving face when he saw me doing this. I just said sorry. He said ""it's not about being sorry"". Another volunteer - maybe his wife or someone else - told the man to just let it go. I didn't know how to respond, so I just left after that. 

I'm thinking of getting hand sanitizer or a small pack of disinfectant wipes with me moving forward to clean my hands after eating. 

But do you think I was the asshole for how I washed my hands up until now?

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my flatmate not to sublet her room?,2,2025-04-03 16:16:00,10,"I (29F) am currently living in a flat share with a very good friend (also 29F) who I've known since kindergarden. We moved together last year in january and it has been a very good living situation until now, that I'd like to continue as much as possible exactly like this. One important thing to say about our apartment is that we are kind of living there illegally. Meaning we are living in a sublet by the actual official tenant, that wasn't approved by the landlord. She once asked the landlord what he would think of a sublet and he made it clear he doesn't want that. So, although nothing has happened until now and it's a quite unlikely too because the landlord isn't even living in the same city and doesn't come by at all, it's still a risky situation. Theoretically we could lose this apartment in a day.

Okay now to the current situation. My flatmate just recently finally finished her Master's and has planned for quite some time, that before starting a full time job she wants to go on a longer trip (6 weeks) through Asia. I have always supported that and helped her with planning a route and finding recommendations. Like two weeks ago, after being with her family for a few days, she comes back to our flat telling me she's booked the flights, accomodations and even some (2 to be exact) language schools. After I congratulated her she let me know tho that now she'll look for a sublet for her room as she has planned her budget around having someelse staying in her room and paying the rent for her. 

For me this started two big problems: 
1. I'm scared further subletting and involving even more people in this will tip over our situation and we'll both end up losing the apartment over night.
2. I'm also just finishing up my own master studies while working an intense part-time job. I'm extremely stressed and know it will only get worse from here on for the next months. Also I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety in the past, am still taking medication for it and just really really need a safe space where I can be calm and without worries. I don't have any sublet experience and fear having to deal with a stranger at home in my current stressed out situation will just spiral me back into a very dark place.

I have told her all of my concerns and we have spoken many many times about in the last two weeks but just can't come to a solution. 
As much as I want to help her and be understanding, I think she should have never planned this trip with not having to pay rent and no job offer yet.
She thinks there are only two solutions: either I back down and let someone stay as a sublet, or I pay the rent for her room as I am the reason she can't sublet it. I feel both solutions are not only unfair but also only good for her and neither of them good for me. 

In our last discussion I discovered that she is scared of not finding a job after coming back and having to leave the city and consequently so adamant about not paying her rent while away."
amitheasshole,AITA for believing that paying for my boyfriend's order isn't the same as when he does it for me since he makes up for 80-90% of the bill ?,51,2025-04-02 22:53:31,93,"I, (25F), been together with boyfriend (35M) for 9 months now (8 to be precise since we broke up late  January and got back together early March). So, my boyfriend is an overspending person and like a friend of his described him ""he can't walk for 5 minutes straight without spending money"".

When we go out for our regular casual dates to simple cafeterias, bars or pubs, I don't spend more than 5-6‚Ç¨ (enough in my country to get a coffee/drink/food) and I'm happy with my order, I don't need more. He gets to spend around 30‚Ç¨ every time and sometimes he offered to pay mine. I was never used to that with my friends, we always paid each for our own order, end of story. Boyfriend insisted to pay sometimes and he said ""it'll be on you another time"". Case is, I'm neither willing nor in a position to cover his expenses since I'm currently a Master's student and not working in order to follow the classes, I'm using my parents money.

Recently we've been out together a lot and I observed that I paid all of our last dates. Luckily we didn't go out drinking but we went at the bowling center and played various games there and instead of paying half half I ended up paying for everything. It was 20‚Ç¨ in total, which is a lot for me and I'm questioning why didn't he think of paying half ? We went there again yesterday because he insisted to do so, I didn't want to because I had spent another 40‚Ç¨ in just a day for his drinks before. 60‚Ç¨ for just 2 simple dates is insane for me! And I paid again! He did as well, but I paid more than him and he didn't even think of asking me to pay something just by himself. He spent a shit ton on drinks as well.

AITA to believe that me paying 30 and 40‚Ç¨ for both of us is unfair since he always makes up for 90% of the bill ? When he spends that amount of money it ain't the same since I only make up for 5‚Ç¨ in total every time. Oh and another example, we went to the cinema once and I paid for both of our tickets, he asked me to do so, I thought each one of us would pay ours (so 14‚Ç¨ in total, double than what I had in mind) and he ended up spending 30‚Ç¨ on food and drinks at the cinema alone for himself (to be clear he obviously gives me if I want to, but I don't, if I wanted something I'd get it myself).

This whole thing is hurting my pockets and thinking that it's my parents money hurts me more."
amitheasshole,AITA for not paying for my friend's brownie,114,2025-04-02 17:21:34,32,"It was one of my friends' birthday and she invited me to her dorm. I showed up and it was sort of a vibe where everyone bought their own pizzas and ate them. I wasn't feeling too hungry or in the mood to spend money so I just bought a can of Pringles. Everyone instantly took to eating from my can and I did not mind sharing. My friend then offered everyone including me a brownie. I initially politely declined insisting I was fine with the Pringles. Bur when she insisted I gave in and ate one. After the party, she called me up 7 times the next day within a span of an hour asking me to pay for the brownie I ate. I told her I didn't have enough cash and that she'd have to wait but she still kept calling. Finally I got mad. I had a cup noodles worth the same as the brownie and went to her room and gave it to her. 
After this she said I was in the wrong and that she still wanted the money. I refused since she offered the brownie to me on her birthday, after I declined without making it clear I had to pay for it. We never talked after that, but I wonder if I'm in the wrong."
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friend to quit our choir?,46,2025-04-02 21:45:11,20,"So I (18f) and my friend ""Liz"" (18f) are currently in the school choir. Our first year choir director a retired during Covid and a new, younger, music teacher started. When the choir started back up, she (Lilian) was the new director. 

A lot of people don't like Lilian. I think she's fine, she's not the best music teacher I've ever had but she's good enough at her job, and as a choir director, she doesn't keep as much attention and respect from students that the old teacher did but we do alright. We won the choir concert our school enters every year under her directorship two years ago and did decently well in it last year. 

All this to say, Liz was complaining to our friends the other day about the choir. Direct quotes include ""the choir is so shit"" ""it's gotten so much worse"" ""we actually sound so bad, I'm embarassed"" 

She's been consistently complaining about how much she dislikes Lilian and thinks the choir has gone so downhill since she took over and that the other singers aren't great for literally a year at this point and I just snapped this time. 

I turned to her and said ""if you think the choirs so bad, literally just leave it. We won (competition) by a mile the other year."" I'm just so sick and tired of her saying the choir is shit, while I, her friend, and some lf our other friends are in this choir. She might not be insulting me personally but who wants to hear that about a choir they love and participate in? 

She got snappy back at me and said ""I can't leave now bc Lilian's roped me into the solo group"", as our song atm and has a part that a group of six of us are performing. I said to her ""you've been in the choir for two years and complained the whole time"" and she got up and left. 

Today Lilian told me there was an extra practice for the solo group and I went to find Liz to tell her.  She just shoved straight past me and said ""yeah, I KNOW"" and hasn't talked to me the rest of the day. 

Our friends are kinda staying out of it bc only a couple of them are actually in the choir or have Lilian as a teacher, so I'm not sure what everyone thinks of what I said. 

I know I wasn't the nicest about it, but if she hates the choir so much then I think she should just leave and stop making it everyone else's problem, bc the rest of us do actually enjoy choir and I hate hearing her say we're bad, and we're shit and all the rest of it.

amitheasshole,AITAH For not apologizing,0,2025-04-03 17:41:41,12,"For context, my mom won‚Äôt go on any trips to Egypt, Italy, France etc because of safety concerns. So you can imagine my surprise when she said we were going to Johannesburg, South Africa, which I know has been dealing with some crime issues lately. My dad first brought this up and mentioned switching it to Tanzania instead and I agreed, which I could tell really upset and angered her so we said let‚Äôs revisit this in a month. It got brought up two more times in the past week, both times the conversation ending with her just saying ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll just fucking cancel the whole thing then‚Äù. I‚Äôve mentioned how Johannesburg isn‚Äôt a city we‚Äôre actually visiting for that long, but kind of using to just fly into, so why don‚Äôt we change it to Cape Town instead. This also caused issues. 

Last night, she brings up the topic again but my dad wasn‚Äôt present. I tried to stay calm and I said how I can tell this is something that upsets her and I don‚Äôt want to do that or go down the route of the argument, so let‚Äôs change the subject. It kept getting brought back up and I kept repeating how I didn‚Äôt want to cause an argument between us, and mentioned how I was surprised we chose to go to Johannesburg when we haven‚Äôt gone to other safer areas of the world because of the same worries. It ended awkwardly but seemingly fine and we ended up talking about other things until my dad got home. Normally my mom will ignore me for a few days after she feels I‚Äôve disrespected her, so it‚Äôs important to note that she spoke to me and acted normally after the trip convo was over. 

This morning I noticed she was ignoring me and being cold, and then at work I saw she‚Äôs been ignoring my texts all day. I texted my dad to see if she was feeling ok because I knew that she was stressed about other issues in her life. He replied by saying she‚Äôs very upset with our argument last night over the trip and how I was disrespectful in the way I spoke to her and I need to apologize. I‚Äôm confused because I felt like I handled the situation well and actually defused a possible argument, and I also feel like she is using me to take out stress unrelated to me. 

My mom and I tend to argue the most out of my family members, and it‚Äôs sometimes obvious that I can be the scapegoat for a lot of her frustrations. There‚Äôs been times where other family members were  fighting with her and I still was blamed. I felt this is important to note in here so you can understand our relationship a bit better. 

Am I wrong for not wanting to apologize? And how should I talk to her about this and adresss me ‚Äúspeaking disrespectfully‚Äù to her in our conversation last night? "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my brother in law to stop picking on my kids or he‚Äôs not coming on vacation?,10179,2025-04-01 16:43:13,1681,"I have three kids, Rob (16m), Lisa (14f), Anne (9F). Lisa is autistic, and her special interest is Taylor Swift. Rob and Anne go along with it and indulge her. They‚Äôre good kids who care and support each other and Rob and yes Anne get attention and support for their interests too.

My brother in law Hector's entire personality is trying to rile people. You know the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke bro‚Äù. Super childish but whatever ‚Äúhe‚Äôs family.‚Äù Except my husband is out of the country, so I guess he thinks he gets to do whatever he wants.

A few weeks ago he started needling at Lisa by making fun of Taylor Swift using lots of childish name calling words, intentionally using the wrong word for fans and stuff. Just really immature kid stuff. Lisa knows that not everyone likes TS and some people even hate her. One of her best friends hates her. She‚Äôs not unable to hear different opinions. She has her own I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd LOVE to share with you all if you had 4 hours to spare.

He would say ‚ÄúWell Swiffers did x y z‚Äù she would say ‚ÄúUncle Hector it‚Äôs Swifties‚Äù and he would say it again to needle at her. Rob was in the room, I was not. Rob said to him ‚ÄúWhy do you keep using the wrong word, she told you the right word?‚Äù

Hector said he can say whatever he wants and to ‚Äúcry about it.‚Äù

Rob said ‚ÄúIt just seems like you‚Äôre going out of your way to upset Lisa‚Äù

Rob asked her to finish what she was talking about and to ignore Hector. This is when I came into the room, and Hector waved at the kids and said ‚ÄúRoberta‚Äôs getting real mad that someone‚Äôs joking about mother (?)‚Äù

(I wasn‚Äôt in the room so I didn‚Äôt hear the comment about me and Rob said I wouldn't get it)

Before I could say anything Rob said ‚ÄúBro did you really just call me a girl‚Äôs name? Are you 12?‚Äù

I put my hands up and said okay enough, Hector, stop. He said I‚Äôm raising soft kids who can‚Äôt take a joke. I said he‚Äôs being so effing rude and that he wouldn‚Äôt be acting like this if my husband was home. I said that if he wants to still go with us to Colorado in the summer like we were planning, he has to stop NOW or he‚Äôs not coming.

This set him off and he said I had no right to do that (yes I do) and that I‚Äôm being a controlling yak over Taylor Swift. I said no, fuck Taylor Swift, this is about you being mean to your niece because her dad isn't home.

He said fuck you and good luck next time we have a problem, we‚Äôre on our own. He took his Costco chicken and left and I swear he must have immediately gone running to my MIL because she called me to ask for what really happened and sighed a lot. I asked her if I was overreacting and she said she just hopes we can work it out because that trip was all he had to look forward to since he was laid off from work. I HATE causing drama in the family so am I the asshole and I‚Äôm out of line?

  
Thanks for all the feedback, I have a path forward. It also needs to be said that some of you are just inventing an entirely new story involving Hector losing his job because his has a bad personality. This is entirely fictional, this didn't happen. His job laid off almost everyone because they are struggling with money and likely won't recover. "
amitheasshole,AITA for forbidding my girlfriend from doing household chores?,2378,2025-04-01 23:26:30,322,"A few years ago while putting together furniture, my (26m) girlfriend (27f) injured her wrists from using the screwdriver. We ended up getting her some wrist braces until the pain went away. We eventually checked with a doctor who said it was no big deal.

Since then, I've slowly forbidden her from doing chores around the house. I noticed that doing these chores (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning dishes, etc.) would consistently agitated her wrists and she wouldn't be able to work on her actual job (small handmade crafts that require a lot of wrist usage.) I kept seeing the pattern of her straining her wrist on chores > bail out on her job after an hour or two and have to wear her wrist brace until the next day. She does love her job and when things go well can happily work up to 6 hours a day on her crafts, so since I can't do her job for her I want her to be able to focus on it.

I have no problem doing these chores, but today I caught her scrubbing a pan when I'd just reminded her yesterday to leave them alone and told her to call me if I'd missed one (and I would have hustled over to do it.)

She told me I'm being overbearing and that she's fine to scrub a pan, but I don't want her getting injured or develop worse long term damage.

AITA for insisting on doing the household chores?

Edit: Some clarifications.

- I should have put ""forbidding"" in quotes. I can't really stop her from doing anything besides maybe chiding her afterwards. I'm not her dad lol.

- I have shown her this thread and she agrees my version of events is more or less accurate but she still feels she's right.

Edit 2: Hello everyone. I stopped responding yesterday because I basically had the answer I needed 10 comments in (I was being the asshole lol) and then this post ended up getting almost 300. I actually got chided myself for spending so much time responding to messages that I ended up slacking on my work.

- I've gotten her a little jig to open soda cans with. I didn't know these things existed until yesterday.

- A lot of people are trying to diagnose her in the comments. We'll keep your ideas in mind the next time we go to the doctor/specialist (and I'll accompany her (if she wants) since people have let me know doctors don't always take women seriously.)

- I appreciate the level headed comments that aimed to help me understand her perspective more (which is why I posted.) To the people voting ESH she says: ""Why am I catching strays here? I just want to do the dishes!""

- Some of you are very angry lol

Thanks to those who helped!"
amitheasshole,AITA if I ask my neighbour to stop smoking outside his front door?,0,2025-04-03 17:06:48,36,"I live on the second floor of a small apartment building and my neighbour's front door is underneath my bedroom window. He will stand outside and smoke ~5 times a day and the wind will blow it into my bedroom if I have the window open, or into my living room if I have my balcony door/window open (which I tend to do quite often, especially now it's getting warmer). I'm not a smoker and don't want my flat to smell of smoke, and my other half is asthmatic, so would I be in the wrong to ask him to go slightly further afield? 

They have a back door which faces a park and is below my kitchen, but the walkway to my front door would act as a buffer for the smoke to not come up. There's also a huge green space in front of his front door which he could use. I haven't asked yet because I don't want to seem rude or selfish. 

TIA 

ETA - obviously I do close my windows when he lights up. It's just not something that I'd ideally like to be doing once it starts getting warmer because the flat gets so hot. No, I don't expect the rest of the world to cater to me I was only asking if it /would/ be rude to ask. If he says no he says no, it is what it is. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not being happy for my friend's new relationship?,6,2025-04-03 07:10:36,13,"This is gonna take some explaining. I (21) had a situation ship (20) for about 5 months that had the potential to be a great relationship. Reason that the relationship was so long was because we didn't want to start anything over the summer when we were in different states. September, I realized that my trauma and other things were fucking me up bad and that I didn't want to drag them down while I figured myself out and finally got help. They agreed and we went our separate ways. I had realized I was in love with them, but they were going through their own mental health struggles and I didn't want to add to that. 

A couple months later, I was at therapy regularly and making progress. My therapist, who I had told about this person, had encouraged me to reach out and clear up things, try to start the friendship up again with clearer expectations. I had been missing them, and wanted to see if they would consider being friends again. 

Throughout this, I had been confiding in a friend (21) that I considered family, B, saying I missed this person and wondered if they would want anything to do with me since I let them go. I had confessed that I still had feelings but wasn't going to act on it because it had been a while and we agreed to go separate ways. B had been sympathetic and had agreed that I needed to talk to the other person and that they would probably want to be friends again. 

During therapy, I had sent the person a text asking to talk and clear things up. After I sent that text, I was hanging with B, and they had said they had been hanging with someone and struggling not to kiss them or confess feelings. I was curious and excited for them, asking who. They respond with ""Are you still having feelings for [person]?"" which floored me. They knew I did. I didn't answer, and they gushed some more about their new crush, which turned out to be the person I'm in love with. A week later they started dating. 

A separate friend asked me how I was doing soon after and I responded that I was hurt and angry. They understood, but also expressed that I should be happy for the new relationship and move on. With my therapist, I agreed that I should move on, but my therapist agrees I still have a right to be hurt and sad. 

I know I didn't have any chance with the person since we had ended things months earlier, but I am hurt that someone I considered found family would go behind my back to date the person that they knew I still had feelings for and let me know so horribly. 

To be clear, I had no expectations to eventually date this person. I let them go, and while I regret that, it was a decision I made in the past. What hurts most is that B knew I was in love with them still, and instead of telling me outright, they listened to me for months talk about this person and then asked if I still had feelings for them when gushing about their crush. Which is the person I'm in love with. 

AITA for not being happy for my friend's new relationship?"

amitheasshole,AITAfor not wanting to give control of the TV to my boyfriend when he doesn't tell me he wants to use it until after I already am?,20,2025-04-02 23:58:39,53,"First of all, this isn't a relationship threatening problem or anything, we move past it just fine, we don't dwell on it, it's a stupid little debate we just happen to have fairly often that I want outside opinions on.

So I like hockey. Sometimes a game I want to watch comes on at around seven. Today is I think the third time, that *after* I put a game on, my boyfriend comes in and says he wants to watch a new Survivor episode at eight. I say he didn't mention that until I'm already watching something, he says I didn't mention wanting to watch anything either. I say he could use his phone or stream it later, he says I can do the same with hockey games. He says Survivor is getting really interesting with teams changing or something, I said so is hockey with teams racing for the playoffs spots. To me it ultimately comes down to the fact that I started using the TV first so the right should go to me this time, and if he mentioned that there's a new Survivor episode at eight *before* either of us start using the TV, there would be no problem and I wouldn't argue with him having it, but he insists I should give it up and let him watch Survivor. 

This time I ultimately agreed to just put it on my phone so he can watch his show, but out of curiosity, what do the strangers on the internet think? Am I the one being the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my boyfriend some sympathy at the death of my grandmother,19,2025-04-02 23:28:07,43,"My grandmother just passed away, not even 4 hours ago. My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship so as soon as I was informed, I sent him a message to let him know what was happening and he called me back right away. 

We had talked moments before me knowing of my grandmother passing and he was watching a football game. Mind you, he's a very caring boyfriend most of the time and we do care for each other, but when he called me, he still had the match going on FULL volume, didn't turn on the light so I could see his face well and have a proper conversation, and for the little I could see, he wasn't even looking at me. Barely holding the phone straight. All this while I was (and still am) bawling my eyes out. 

So obviously I get upset. He was shocked that I was upset but I'm sorry, am I asking for the bare minimum here or am I overreacting? I was hoping for some sympathy, sensitivity and more touch in such a delicate moment, but I feel he was not really there. He said sorry for the volume, but he said he could still hear me even if he wasn't looking at me. For me that's quite disrespectful, not dedicating even just 10-15 min of your time paying attention to someone you love loosing someone they love. 

Not only that, but when I brought it up he said ""I don't even know why you're acting this way, using the situation you're in now to make me feel bad"", implying I'm manipulating this situation to make him feel bad. Why would I even do that??? For what purpose??? I'm just sad and I wanted some consolation!!!

Anyway, need some support, or let me know if I'm the asshole"
amitheasshole,AITA for being sick of my boyfriends grandmother and wanting to cut her off?,0,2025-04-03 20:32:14,2,"I 24 female share a son with my boyfriend 27 male between the two of us. We have three kids. I have a six-year-old. He has a seven year-old their best friends and get along great they love being sisters. However, due to custody agreements, we don‚Äôt get to see his daughter all that much so our time with her is very valuable we didn‚Äôt get her last Christmas Eve. So we decided to not spend the day traveling to family members house and not have any family members over because I did not feel like cooking and I just wanted to enjoy my day with my kids. I also had mono and was extremely tired and depressed through the month of December so I was really just trying to push through and have a happy day with my kids because of this, my boyfriend‚Äòs family got extremely offended and upset I was expecting my family to also be upset, but they were actually pretty cool about it and didn‚Äôt really care. Just some back round story My boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother lives states away so every time she comes up she feels really entitled on coming over. She‚Äôs showed up at my house unannounced several times and every single time she comes over she brings up a problem for example, the one time I forgot to invite one of my boyfriends uncles to a party, despite me telling my boyfriend to invite whoever you‚Äôd like from your family because I couldn‚Äôt keep track of everybody I‚Äôm the one who got shit for it my boyfriend also never stepped in and defend me and it gets really annoying. My boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother also tends to kiss my boyfriend‚Äôs baby mama‚Äôs ass. She‚Äôll post things about him and my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother will comment and agree. Personally I don‚Äôt like this. I think there‚Äôs a line of loyalty and I think it‚Äôs really wrong or disrespectful. I also don‚Äôt want anyone around. Who‚Äôs going to be talking about my kids dad. Now back to the issue. A couple days before Christmas my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother called and said she knew that Bailey was going to be at our house and my boyfriend‚Äôs baby mama said that she can come over the day after Christmas AT MY HOUSE this really pissed me off because for one it was our time we have the right to decide what we‚Äôre going to do with it. It was actually my time and I was going to be going to my mom‚Äòs. I was watching my stepdaughter, which I have no issues doing, but the fact that I was being told what to do really rubbed me the wrong way, especially when a couple days prior my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother called asking what my problem was because they weren‚Äôt coming over. It was never planned for them to come over and like I said this was a mutual agreement between my boyfriend and I we were exhausted. I wasn‚Äôt going to have her come over knowing she was upset with me without my boyfriend there he was at work. We asked my boyfriend‚Äôs baby mama if she can stay an extra day because she was going to be with us on the weekend anyway she said no she had practice for a sport it turns out she didn‚Äôt have practice my boyfriend‚Äôs baby mama picked her up and took her to my boyfriends dads house this really got me upset because they just couldn‚Äôt respect a no I also felt pretty used as babysitter on top of all her gifts being sent to her mom‚Äôs house and clothes that we really needed for her as times are tough. My boyfriend pays a lot of money in child support. I was fully willing to set up another day where my boyfriend was able to be present with his grandmother and kids I just wasn‚Äôt going to that day. I also hate how my boyfriend was lied to. He doesn‚Äôt get to see her much at all so I felt like his time was being taken away but sure there are posts claiming he‚Äôs a dead beat I feel like my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother contributes to the picture she paints I feel like his whole family did in this situation.

amitheasshole,AITA for keeping my friends baby mommas money,5,2025-04-03 05:43:04,13,"AITA for charging my friends(ex) girlfriend half the cost of my utilities? 3 years ago my husband (56) & I (48) met and became friends with a young man (32). We became a safe place for him to come when his f28 partner became abusive or forced him out of their shared home. They have 2 children together under the age of 6. 7 months ago she spent their rent money and they we're evicted. She went to her family here locally but he was left homeless because her family doesn't like the fights and of course take her side. After much debating my husband & I offered him a place to stay under conditions. 1 he was to get a new job (he's previous job laid him off and she refused to put the children in daycare. So he was the stat at home parent for about a year. He help with maintenance projects around our home, and no fighting with her at our home. Within a week she brought her children to my home and with no discussion left them with their father. She buys them food but that is all. She won't take them when she's not working so my friend hasn't been able to find work. She won't even agree to me watching them for him even though they live in my home. In 8 months she paid half my utilities bill about $400 each time over winter and once she lent me half . This month she paid half ($240)but wants to treat it as a loan and I'm refusing to give it back. She doesn't pay for anything besides their food. Not laundry soap or toilet paper or bathing items.

amitheasshole,AITA for expecting my boyfriend (30M) to keep paying for everything after he offered ‚Äî even though I make good money myself? (F23),0,2025-04-04 00:59:44,15,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. He‚Äôs 30 and earns around $800k a year. Early in our relationship, he told me not to worry about money and that he‚Äôd take care of everything. I didn‚Äôt ask for that ‚Äî he offered it willingly and seemed genuinely happy to do so. I work full-time and make good money myself, so it wasn‚Äôt like I needed him to ‚Äî but I appreciated it.

He paid for our dates, trips, paid all the bills, and spoiled me with endless gifts. He always said he liked providing and that it made him feel good to take care of someone he loved. I never demanded anything ‚Äî I just accepted what he said he wanted to give. It also made me feel like we were working toward something serious and long-term. He even mentioned wanting to propose and said that when we have kids, I could be a stay-at-home mom if I wanted.

But lately, his attitude has totally shifted. He‚Äôs made comments like, ‚ÄúYou act like I‚Äôm an ATM,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting too comfortable,‚Äù which really threw me off. I‚Äôve been working the whole time ‚Äî I don‚Äôt not to rely on him ‚Äî but it‚Äôs confusing when he‚Äôs the one who originally insisted on paying. If he‚Äôs already pulling back and being resentful now, I honestly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd feel safe being a stay-at-home mom later on. What if I give up my career (not something I would do) and he changes his mind again? I can‚Äôt be with someone not willing to take over expenses when I‚Äôm pregnant and let me relax. 

When I brought it up, I told him I was just following the dynamic he set from the start. He told me I was being entitled, acting like a leech, & ungrateful, which honestly hurt. I‚Äôm just trying to understand how things changed so quickly. I feel like he‚Äôs rewriting the terms of our relationship and making me feel guilty for something he pushed for.

So, AITA for expecting him to stick to what he originally offered? Or am I being unreasonable?

amitheasshole,AITA for making a scene in front of our friends,1,2025-04-03 14:25:07,13,"Last edit: Nico an Nick are our couple friends
I am married to John (not real names obvs)

Edit for better flow

English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes


On Sunday we were at some very close friends' house, having a nice time. I (44f) and the wife, Nico (60f) are both therapists. At some point Nico started to tell us about meeting a fellow therapist during her flight to a conference. How he looked very well, has a 6yo (he's also 60) and just got married a third time. I said that 16 years ago, after having my first child, we (me and the 60yo guy) shared a practice (that was very close to my house) before coming to work full time in my own practice and that I hadn't seen him since.
Now comes the tricky part. My husband started getting angry saying he didn't know I worked at that practice, do I think it's normal that he didn't know that?!? I replied that he probably doesn't remember, it's only been for 6 months or so and that it's not possible he DIDN'T KNOW at all. He kept pushing, huffing and puffing about it and at some point I raised my voice telling him I WASN'T SNEACKING OFF TO SEE CLIENTS behind his back and he probably didn't really care that much about my work with all of his travelling to exotic places for work (he had for 22 years a great job that took him all over the world for weeks at a time, I am still angry and resentful about that). How would I even go about it? He got upset, our friends were kind of embarassed (I appologized to them the next day, they were gracious about the whole thing) and it pretty much ruined the mood for everybody.
So AITA for telling him he didn't care that much and that what he was saying was kind of crazy? I am TA for sure for not keeping it together especially as we were at our friends' house.logized to them the next day, they were gracious about the whole thing) and it pretty much ruined the mood for everybody.

amitheasshole,AITA ‚Äúhurting a friend‚Äù by not approaching to her after she had a fight with a mutual friend?,1,2025-04-03 13:48:37,15,"I (35f) and Anna(36f) had known each other for 7ys. We supported each other during hard times and I literally consider her as my best friend and she knows everything happening in my life. I share everything happened to me. I am more open and love to share, she seemed to be ok with it. For the last 2years we only meet once a week because of work. Anna is a soft girl who has high sensibility and can get emotionally affected by things she see on the street. She also highly values her privacy and HATES people spreading things related to her without consulting her is she is ok with it or not. She made this quite clear to me and I respect that. 

Four months ago a mutual friend showed interest in her and she didn‚Äôt like it and rejected him in a quite fierce way. The guy is also one of my best friend so he came to me to talk about it because he was frustrated  and felt uncomfortable about the way how she rejected him. Anna noticed it and decided not to talk to me about it. I think it is her right and because of she really values her privacy and I was afraid of marking her felt forced to tell me things that she may not felt comfortable to share. So I didn‚Äôt go to ask her about it. I thought she will or will not come to talk to me about it when she is ready. It is her choice. Also I feel this thing happened between two adults and I am not part of it so I should let themselves to deal with it. If anyone wants me to be there I will be there to support whoever needs my accompany. However, then Anna was quite distant and cold to me, I felt it and felt super hurt. Cause I knew she might feel super bad about what happened between them and I was worried about her and was willing to be there for her after what happened. But again we are adults, I know friends come and go. So I respected her decision and slowly moved on. We never meet in private time anymore. I thought this is the end of our interaction. However, four months later she asked me to meet her after work, I thought she wants to catch up and I travelled 1h to meet her near her house. It turns out she wanted to make it clear that I don‚Äôt deserve her friendship anymore because I was involved in that situation ( for being a mutual friend) and was not there for her.  She said and I quote here :‚Äù i was hurt by that situation.‚Äù So I asked her directly: you mean I hurt you? She answered: yes, that is how she felt. I repeated the question with astonishment and she confirmed that is what she really felt. On that night I totally speechless, also because she firmly believes I was entangled with both of them and their unsuccessful relationship, but I literally think that is none of my business and she disagrees.  After that night it took me three weeks to think about what really happened between us, and make me wonder if I am the A in that situation. So AITA? "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I told my mom that I don‚Äôt want her to come with me to my college tour?,11,2025-04-03 00:54:01,23,"Okay so I know this may not seem that interesting but I need some help or reassurance. So far during the 2024-2025 school year I‚Äôve only visited one college and that was with my bonus mom and dad. I‚Äôve planned 3 other college visits and a doctors visit for birth control that my mom was supposed to take me to. Each and every time my mom has bailed on me saying either she forgot or that she had work, even though I would tell her weeks in advance and ask her which day would be best for her. 

A few months ago my mom has been telling me that I need to plan visits on Thursdays since she doesn‚Äôt work on those days. The only problem though was the fact that my dad worked those days. I told her this and she explained to me that she doesn‚Äôt care if my dad doesn‚Äôt come. But honestly I want him to be there cause I would hate it if I was there with her by myself. I finally picked a day to go and it‚Äôs admitted student day. But it‚Äôs the very last admitted student they‚Äôre having so I can‚Äôt miss it. I told my mom about it when I first scheduled it two months ago and she never mentioned it again. So me and my parents just assumed she wasn‚Äôt coming.

Now this is when the problem comes in, I texted her yesterday to see if she was still planning on coming and she said she was. I told her that my bonus mom, dad, and I were planning on going and I can only bring two people because we weren‚Äôt sure if she would come or not. She told me that I‚Äôll have to choose between my bonus mom and dad because she‚Äôll always be there unless there‚Äôs an emergency.

At this point idk what to do because I‚Äôll feel terrible telling one of my parents that they can‚Äôt go even after we planned all this, but I‚Äôm also afraid of the backlash I‚Äôll get from my mom and her side of the family if I tell her I don‚Äôt want her to go. So wibta if I told her no?"

amitheasshole,AITA For Telling My Best Friend That She Was Overreacting About A Hypothetical Question?,6,2025-04-03 02:14:51,5,"I just had a very weird(and stupid)argument with my best friend of almost 7 years. I tend to be a very blunt person without meaning to and I misunderstand social situations so maybe it's one of those times? Well, my best friend has been in many relationships, all of them ending badly. She's in a new one and she was telling me about how she shares fun hypothetical situations and he shuts it down immediately by saying ""But what if this happened-"" or ""That just can't happen because-"" When she was telling me this, it reminded me of myself. I misunderstand hypothetical situations a lot and answer the question seriously. She then said that it really made her mad and that when he took her home, she just slammed the door on his face before he could walk in. But then she mentioned how he apologized to her and they made up. This is exactly what I said in response

""You know I will tell you the truth. But I think you're overreacting kind of. I don't think he was necessarily hating on your hypothetical but maybe he's just a realistic person. But I'm glad it all worked out in the end."" My response was based on the info she gave me

Well, she got mad at me and said that I was coming at her with attitude(She was sending me voice messages, I was texting). She then said I was incorrect(which it isn't a matter of who's correct or not. It's based on opinion) and then began to chastise me for my way of thinking. It gave me an unexplainable feeling, honestly. Hearing the passive aggressiveness in her voice and babytalking me like I was stupid for saying what I said. She then shared more information that she didn't tell me beforehand about how he admitted that he was being a jerk on purpose and he knew it would bother her. But she didn't tell me that before. So I don't really know why she's upset at me for saying what I said. She said that she wanted to share a moment of how her feelings were validated by him when he apologized. But because from the language that she was using like ""He always shoots me down"", it didn't seem like she was ranting about a happy moment at all!

I apologized for offending her because I didn't mean to and I didn't know that she was trying to rant about a happy moment. I said I misunderstood what she wanted out of the conversation and I told her 

She then said ""All my emotions are supposed to be valid and hearing my best friend invalidate me while my boyfriend does really hurts me."" I don't believe all emotions are valid. Not just this situation, just life in general. And then she started crying....? I don't think she's just upset because of what I said... I feel like she's upset about something else left unsaid. 

She's not responding to me now. She has admitted to me that she has anger issues so I don't know if that's playing a role in this situation or if it's just my blunt personality and my tendency to misunderstand social cues. This whole thing is just very childish and immature. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not shortening my workout for two strangers?,3795,2025-04-01 15:40:24,334,"Yesterday at the gym around 5:30 PM, I started my leg day workout, which is usually the longest of the week. I was using the power rack to do squats, deadlifts, and good mornings, typically taking about 30-40 minutes. There are three power racks, and I was using one of them. I take about 3-minute rests between squat sets since I‚Äôm doing heavy weight for low reps.

While I was squatting, two girls, who I‚Äôll call Girl A and Girl B, started waiting behind me. Neither approached me to ask how many sets I had left, but they just hung around. When I finished squatting and began re-racking my weights to prepare for deadlifts, I could tell they assumed I was done. I walked up to Girl A and asked if she was waiting for me to finish. She said yes, so I explained that I still had deadlifts and another movement to do. She responded with ‚ÄúUgh of course you do‚Ä¶‚Äù and I just moved on.

As I set up and began deadlifting, both girls stood nearby, rolling their eyes and acting frustrated, as though I should be shortening my workout for them. I decided to be polite and ask Girl A what she wanted to do. She said squats, so I offered her the nearby squatting area, since I wasn‚Äôt using it. She declined, so I kept going with my workout.

Meanwhile, another guy using a different power rack offered the same to Girl B, but she also declined. A group of two women then came up, and the girls complained that they had been waiting for 30 minutes and it was ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù I ignored them.

When I finished deadlifting, Girl A moved away to warm up. I approached Girl B and, before I could speak, she looked at me and paused her music, saying, ‚ÄúWHAT??? Hold on, I can‚Äôt hear you.‚Äù I told her I still had one more movement to do and would need 5-10 more minutes. She seemed upset and responded sarcastically, ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôve already been here 30 minutes; what‚Äôs another 10?‚Äù I shook my head and walked away.

As I started my next movement, I briefly considered shortening it to avoid further conflict, but then decided not to. I didn‚Äôt want to reward their rudeness by letting them dictate my workout. I‚Äôve been lifting since 2016 and have always tried to be respectful and kind to others at the gym. When people ask politely, I don‚Äôt mind sharing equipment, but the way these girls treated me was unpleasant.

She has a friend there and they were going to meet up with their dogs to participate in the dog bowl. However when I asked to come she told me I needed to stay at home to watch the other animals and that she wanted it to just be her, our mom, and the dog.

When I pushed back on this she mentioned that  we go on trips and to things like concerts without her all the time. This is true but we assume  she doesn‚Äôt  want to come. She also pointed out that every time the three of us go somewhere she feels like she‚Äôs made the third wheel and the activities she wants to do on the trip are put off until the last minute. I disagreed but promised to not get in the way on the trip, she still didn‚Äôt want me to come. 

I managed to convince my mom to let me come, and as we were ordering plane tickets she got one for me. My sister got upset saying how it wasn‚Äôt fair and that she should be allowed to have something like this for just herself for once and that it wasn‚Äôt okay that I forced myself into going.

amitheasshole,AITA seeing coworker out of work,13,2025-04-02 19:40:53,16,"A coworker who was going through an extremely distressing time due a family accident gave me his number so I could message him. He was off work for a while and I text him a couple of times just checking that he was ok, asking if there was anything we could do for him from the office and show him our support. 

We have established a good relationship of banter over the years and it‚Äôs all very lighthearted. He is considerably older than me (2x my age, I am in my 20‚Äôs) but age doesn‚Äôt matter to me in friendships. 

One Saturday I had messaged him and just asked how he was as it had been a long time since I‚Äôd heard anything. He was at home and invited me over for a drink & catch up if I wanted to that evening. 
I hesitated but decided to go because it wasn‚Äôt normal circumstances. He was going through a really hard time and had little support as it was. So I went over to his house and we had a catch up for 1 hour. Talked mostly about what has been happening with the accident and I had half a drink. It was all very proper and I made sure not to overstay my welcome and left at 7pm. When I left I gave him a hug goodbye and felt like we‚Äôd had a friendly drink and I was happy to see he was ok. 

Next day at work I see my female coworker who I work alongside, she is really close to him and encouraged me to text him in the first place to check in. I tell her about seeing him on Saturday and explain he had invited me. She blows up. She is shocked I did that. She couldn‚Äôt believe I actually went to his house alone and had a drink with him. I sit there trying not to cry while she practically tells me off as if I‚Äôve done something very wrong. I explain that I was just trying to be a supportive friend during a hard time. She tells me he‚Äôs so much older than me and if I want to see him alone out of work that‚Äôs my decision but I‚Äôm ‚Äúplaying with fire‚Äù. She tells me ‚Äúhe‚Äôs in a very vulnerable place at the moment‚Äù really making me feel like I drove there and turned up uninvited. 
I try to explain that I had no motive in going at all other than to show support. At work we usually have a drink on Friday‚Äôs so to me I didn‚Äôt see as any different. 

Was it wrong of me to see my older coworker out of work by going to his house?

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my mom I can't be her sounding board about my sister?,183,2025-04-02 05:29:46,31,"So last year, I(37f) went no contact with my younger sister(35f). She is bipolar and a alcoholic and will message me randomly at all hours of the night complaining about her life or other members of our family. Well in all this, she has a tendency to forget factual memories and insert mad up ones. Currently, she believes our father is dead and that he was amazing and misses him and thinks I and my mother are awful people for not caring about him (he was also an alcoholic and my mother's abuser). 

I went no contact because while drunk, she contacted me and left a Wall of texts about how she hated me, I was a goody two shoes, grimy and disloyal, called my son(5m) (my miracle Rainbow child) a Ahole, and said she couldn't wait to laugh when my husband leaves me like the last one. I went low contact a few months prior, due to her previous bad behavior and refusal to listen to any advice offered to her. 

So, today my mother brought her up while we had lunch and how she was blocked again from my sister because they got into a disagreement last week. She then told me how my sister sounded drunk while they spoke. I interrupted her and asked her to repeat herself, so she did. I lost it and started bawling. Two weeks ago, she told me my sister is currently pregnant with her 4th child. I am struggling to get pregnant and stay that way, I've had fertility issues my whole adult life. Once I calmed down, I told I was sorry, but I could no longer talk about my sister anymore with her or hear about her. It hurts me too much to learn about her mistreatment of my mother, her own children or anyone else. I just couldn't do it anymore. She got quiet and changed the subject, but I could tell it hurt her a bit.
So AITA to my mom here? "
amitheasshole,AITA for being this distant from my family?,6,2025-04-02 23:40:43,12,"I (33F) have been feeling frustrated at my family for being passive aggressive towards me.

I admit I‚Äôve been distant ever since there was a conflict that happened between my partner (living together 7 years, together for 18) and them. Long story short, he does not feel welcome, my family have said some hurtful things, and he‚Äôs not willing to be around them without talking things out. They‚Äôve decided he‚Äôs the bad guy but he‚Äôs ‚Äústill welcome at their house.‚Äù Attempts have been made by my partner to fix things but no compromise. Early on when I would visit my family alone, I would be lectured about how we‚Äôre wrong and often felt gaslit so quality time with them hasn‚Äôt been great either.

They clearly desire more time with me, don‚Äôt really seem to care about having time with my partner, which is hurtful to both of us, but I still do make an effort to see at least my parents  at least once a month.

Because of this, they‚Äôve been very passive aggressive when trying to plan family outings. They talk about wanting to plan things and once everyone agrees to it, they put it on me, literally ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in charge,‚Äù to get everyone‚Äôs schedules and pick an activity because I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe one that‚Äôs always busy.‚Äù

I stayed friends with them it was a group of 7 cause I had no other friends and didn't want to be alone. I heard them talking bad bout me sometimes but choosed to ignore it. One day I was with my friend and her phone was on and I saw a message and it was from a group chat. With everyone but me in it. I was so mad because I felt betray and saw they were talking bad about me so I looked in her phone. I knew it was wrong but I needed to know. I saw messages saying they couldn't wait till they weren't friends with me and making fun of things I did in our other groupcht with all of us. I confronted them and they got mad at me for lookin in her phone cause it was invasion of privacy. They told me I was so wrong for doin that and didn't even apologize for i.

One of the baristas who was working that day is known to have a fainting disorder and has once fainted at work, nothing serious but everyone was worried at the time. Since then we all joke about it often. As per her idea I sent a picture to the staff group chat of her laying on the floor and told everyone she fainted again. Everyone in the group chat got that it was a prank instantly and found it funny except for the manager. Note that we are all very friendly with each other and often joke/say things that are completely inappropriate for a workplace but genuinely everyone is good with it, including the store manager who is probably the one saying the most unhinged stuff often.  We already apologized and the lie ended as soon as he called and she picked up yelling ""April fools"", we did not drag it for even a second once he called us asking if she was okay. No one is in trouble from it but I could tell from his voice he is as actually mad about it. He's on holiday and will come back next week and I'd hate that maybe from this the light and friendly work environment we have might suffer a bit from this. Where we the assholes? "

So, my friend Liz and I regularly smoke weed together. This time, she ordered weed fudge from my dealer, who explicitly told me that she should only take small bites at a time. Liz ignored this advice and ate almost the entire thing herself, leaving just a small piece for me to try.
While I felt nothing unusual from my tiny bite, Liz was utterly out of it. The next day, she was furious with me. Apparently, she had gone to Boots (a pharmacy chain) and used one of their drugs tests, which supposedly showed she was positive for ketamine. 
I spoke to the dealer, and they confirmed that there was absolutely no ketamine in the edibles. Liz is now blaming me for her situation because she ordered from my dealer and because I don‚Äôt believe her about the ketamine. She insists that I should trust her test results over the dealer‚Äôs word. 

Am I the asshole for not believing Liz's test results and insisting that there was no ketamine involved? She keeps saying that I should trust her test, but I know my dealer's products are carefully made and checked.


First time poster, if it matters I'm autistic and im 30 years old. Also anyone who knows me knows I will only do weed no other drugs my dealer knows this and respect it

Extra information based on questions in the comments. 
1 no I did not see the test Liz took
2 my dealer has all their stuff tested and checked and I'm 100% sure of that.

amitheasshole,AITA for getting something done.,10,2025-04-02 20:26:16,15,"Alright so I'm married and lately my wife has been yelling just about every time she's awake. Sometimes I feel like she's even yelling at me in her sleep. Anyways, she doesn't have a job cause she lost it by being late and has lost other jobs before for the same reason and blames it on mental health. She's had about 4 or 5 jobs in the past year while I've been at the same one for the last 2 years. She sleeps in until like 1 in the afternoon and when I get home she's always still in pajamas and laying on the couch with nothing done. 

Here's the thing that just happened. I'm in a band I won't name the name of but we do rehearsals at the house once a week. I've been working a lot lately and the rehearsal rooms been pretty dirty and I had the day off it's Wednesday so i decided to clean it and vacuum it before the boys got here on Thursday. Now this happens so much so that I already knew as soon as I started the vaccum she was gonna get off the couch to come yell at me about how I should be cleaning something that benefits her and sure enough as soon as I turned the vacuum off she came down to yell at me about how I should be cleaning the basement instead or doing the dishes. I said to her that I have been working all week and have people coming over who need to utilize this room and that the basement isn't an absolutely necessary space to be cleaned and that I'll clean it when I'm available to clean it and there's nothing else going on. We don't have a garage or a shed so everything kinda goes down there and there's not enough shelves. She threatened that if I don't clean it up right now that while I'm at work tomorrow she's going to take all the stuff from down there and throw it all in the rehearsal room that I had just about finished cleaning. I told her she needed to stop yelling at me that I'm tired of her yelling at me all the time. Lately she hasn't even been intimate with me I've had to ask her for 3 weeks now and every single time she comes up with some sort of your typical response of I'm too tired or I'm too hungry or I'm too stressed out even tho while I was at work for 10 hours cutting down trees she just got 12 hours of sleep and then sat on the couch watching tv and drinking a latte until I got home and she doesn't even get up to come welcome me at the door and instead finds something else to yell at me about. I've tried to get her to go to counseling and she refuses to and i just don't know what to do I don't want to leave her because I love her but deep down I kinda feel like I'm being abused. It's so hard not to yell back and not to argue with her but it just seems like it's all I have left in me just this deep sadness and anger towards the situation "

I have been accustom to a bit more money (like being able to buy a cake the day before) but I pay for more than 60% of our stuff and I don‚Äôt even have a job ATM (it was more before) due to circumstances and they have taken advantage of that I feel. The only thing is they take care of a lot‚Ä¶ Like some cooking, cleaning, yard-work, my care if my health is faltering and even my kids homework but not without some, reminder that they did so. Also some SLOOOOW Upgrades in my home when time allows which they like to throw in my face and tell me the will charge me for when they get mad‚Ä¶dang as I write this I‚Äôm just starting to get embarrassed with myself but maybe you all have some kind input because that‚Äôs really what I need AIM!

amitheasshole,AITA for getting frustrated with my downstairs neighbors who keep complaining about *every* little noise?,9,2025-04-02 19:50:21,26,"I (21, F) live in a 4-bed flat on the 2nd and 3rd floors with three flatmates, all of us students. Since we moved in, we‚Äôve had ongoing complaints from the tenants living below us. At first, it seemed like a minor issue, but it‚Äôs escalated to a point where it‚Äôs becoming ridiculous, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like we‚Äôre being harassed.

The complaints didn‚Äôt start over loud music or parties (which, by the way, we‚Äôre all very mindful of since we‚Äôre students and know how annoying noisy neighbors can be). Instead, it was about *walking around*. Yes, apparently the way we move around the flat is bothering them. They first contacted our letting agency, who passed the complaints on to us and told us that there was nothing they could do and that we should try and handle it ourselves. So we did. We gave them my number, so they could reach out if there was an issue.

Here‚Äôs the thing:  oncewe realized that they weren‚Äôt complaining about late-night noise or loud talking ‚Äî and that it was about our normal movements around the flat, we‚Äôve taken several steps to accommodate them: we fixed our doors so they close really slowly (so they don‚Äôt slam), we‚Äôve been walking on our tiptoes everywhere, and we make a conscious effort to be extra quiet. If something accidentally falls on the floor, our instinctive reaction is to worry if we‚Äôve bothered them. 

But, they‚Äôre still complaining, and it‚Äôs starting to feel like harassment. Every time we even *slightly* move around, they text me or my flatmates. It got to a point where another person in our flat‚Äôs number gets passed on when the person they‚Äôve been texting gets mentally drained by the extent of their complaints.

At this point, it feels like no matter what we do, it won‚Äôt be enough for them. I‚Äôm starting to feel like we‚Äôre living under a microscope, and it‚Äôs draining. We‚Äôve tried to be polite, but we‚Äôre all getting frustrated because it‚Äôs clear that no matter what we do, we‚Äôre always going to be a problem for them. So we‚Äôre seriously considering giving up on accommodating their every complaint.

So, AITA for getting annoyed and starting to feel like we can‚Äôt do anything without being constantly criticized by our neighbors? "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my best friend she's a bully?,5,2025-04-03 00:31:10,12,"WARNING: bullying, racism, homophobia, and ED's mentioned. My best friend (16F) and I (17F) have known each other since kindergarten. we have of course fallen out a few times especially during covid because we couldn't see each other but we became extremely close when we entered high school. I would like to note that we live in a very conservative and closed-minded area, so this next part is not out of the normal per say.

I figured out that I was gay in 9th grade. I am an only child and keep to myself a lot so coming out was probably the hardest thing I have ever done. My best friend was probably one of the last people I came out too because we were so close I was scared that she would see me different and stop being friends with me. When I came out to her, she hugged me, and out bond became stronger. we went into 11th grade, and she started changing. I switched schools for 10th grade but ended up going back to my original high school due to me developing an ED caused by fat shaming. when I transferred back, I would hear her call one of her darker skinned friend's racist slurs. I feel very strongly about this topic and told my best friend that I did not feel comfortable hearing what she was saying and politely asked her to stop. Even if she didn't agree with me, I asked her to at least refrain from saying hateful comments and slurs around me because it made me extremely uncomfortable. She did not. She then moved onto calling me homophobic slurs and telling me it was just a joke. Then I noticed she started bullying others at our school. she even got one of the students suspended because she made up a story that he touched her. The day after that happened, she confidently told me that she made the whole thing up just to get him suspended because she didn't like him. We are in 12th grade now and it has gotten to the point that no one is friends with her anymore. I would consider myself an empathetic person and I'm honestly only friends with her because I am the only one that will hang out with her. I have tried to confront her about her behavior before saying she's a bully and she doesn't believe me. I have gone to the guidance counselor, and she says that it's just normal teenage girl behavior. AITA for calling out my best friend for her actions?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not watching my nieces?,1225,2025-04-01 17:28:44,165,"I 22M have recently moved closer to my siblings. I have two sisters, one with three kids and the other with two. Before I officially moved, I had told my sisters that I am not a babysitter as I knew they would try to guilt trip me because I had been so far away from them for 5 years.

Picking them up from school and the occasional hang out at my place is fine with me, but I don't want watching them to become a normal occasion as I have my own life and things to worry about. 

Now, I love my nieces and nephews and when I was in high school would watch them from time to time. But now that I'm older I want to worry about my own life and not have to constantly be the family babysitter.

Apparently, I wasn't clear enough as last weekend my sister let's call her Ana and her husband wanted to go out with friends from work. So, she called me to babysit while they went out. I was particularly exhausted from work that night, so I declined because I just wanted to take a shower and go to bed. Plus, I know this particular sister wouldn't be home till 1 or 2 am. She has always loved to party and never wants it to end. What I was not expecting was one of the biggest arguments between Ana and me.

She called me selfish for not helping her out and claiming that I didn't want to see her kids. I wasn't exactly an angel myself in my response I won't lie. She quickly involved my mom who told me that Ana would do the same for me and that I should just do it as it wouldn't hurt me.

I was pretty annoyed at this point and reminded both of them that I said that I was not a babysitter before turning off my phone and going to bed. My mom and some of my friends still think I was overacting and one suggested that I take it here.

So, AITA for not watching my nieces even though I clearly told my sisters that I am not a babysitter? Should I have just toughed it out to avoid all this drama? At this point I don't know. "
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my partner to rehome his new puppy?,229,2025-04-02 02:32:33,104,"I 26(f) recently bought my first home. My partner of 3 years lives with me. I‚Äôve had my dog for 5 years, since she was a puppy and I‚Äôve trained her. She‚Äôs a Pomeranian chihuahua. 

Since I have an hour commute from work and my partner has been looking for a full time job (he‚Äôs currently part time) I asked him if we could get a new pet to keep boo (my dog) from being lonely. He only agreed IF he got to choose and raise the new dog as his own, as he wanted a close bond like the one I have with my dog. 

I agreed! I‚Äôd hope everyone could have a close companion and since he never grew up with a close pet I thought this would be his chance.

The puppy was cute and we got her at a shelter since he just fell in love with her picture. A maybe 5month old beagle. His passion and excitement made me hopeful. 

We adopted her and I warned him the first few weeks would be rough due to potty training. She‚Äôs a puppy though so he should expect accidents. Two days later I come home and she‚Äôs gone. He took her to a ‚Äúdoggy boot camp‚Äù to be trained by a professional. He reassured me it was his dog, his decision, and his money. 

When she returned she was not potty trained and could barely hold her excitement on walks. They only taught her not to bark‚Ä¶ then recommended a shock collar that they used in their facility.

Ok here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole. 
I never really bonded with her. Her energy and excitement was too much for me. I knew she was a puppy so I thought I‚Äôd try to train her but I couldn‚Äôt help but resent my partner for not taking the time to train her himself. He wouldn‚Äôt take her on walks. When she pooped (and I‚Äôm talking just massacring her kennel despite constant outside time) it added to my stress and resentment. When he would just leave her outside for hours, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel more resentment! She was either trapped in a kennel, outside in the yard, or in my house with me by myself trying to train her and cleaning her accidents.

I didn‚Äôt sign up for a puppy nor did I image getting a bigger dog. I brought it up to a coworker and she had retired parents who previously had a beagle, who they loved and cared for to old age, who‚Äôd also love a puppy, I thought it was fate. 

I brought it up to him and asked him to think about what‚Äôs best for the dog. And if he truly wanted to care for her, then great! We wouldn‚Äôt have to rehome her. He took some time to think then said to rehome her but I need to know that he‚Äôs only saying yes because he knows I just want to get rid of her and he never wants another pet again for the rest of our lives because of this and I should‚Äôve given him more grace for his first pet. Then he compared it to a made up scenario of him getting rid of boo. It turned into a heated argument. 

But what do you guys think. Am I an asshole for this? "

English is not our first language, and while it's more common now, my mom didn‚Äôt grow up speaking it much. Because of this, she a lot of times makes grammatical mistakes or mispronounces words.

When my mom spoke to him for the first time, he was speaking in our traditional language, but she chose to respond in English. Her English isn‚Äôt perfect(grammatical errors, and being unable to find the right word), so it felt a bit unnatural. Not to mention there were a lot of people on the video call all talking in our traditional language.

A few days later, we had guests over who also spoke our traditional language, but my mom still tried to speak in English with them. I am noticing this pattern and i of genuine concern of her image wanna ask her about this.

amitheasshole,AITA for buzzing my hair without asking my mother,8,2025-04-02 21:10:51,17,"I made a new account to do this because i dont want my friends on my other accounts to worry. i 19f and my mother 42f (at least i think she is 42 sorry about that) dont really have the best relationship and honestly now its come to a head. I had always had a large afro...until i was put in military school, a temporary facility, and a residential facility then my hair started falling out. Since then i did my best to get it back but it really did. I eventually got an undercut which as some of you may know can become quite ugly when it grows out. So with my ugly growing undercut and the Oklahoma heat i wanted to buzz my hair. I did. I told my oldest brother 23m because it was his clippers i used then told my mom. I had told her i wanted it short about a week ago which she forgot so i showed her. Its of course patchy but its better than ubering across town and paying to get it done.

She asked me if i was trying to do something with myself or whatever kids these days do (still got no clue what she is talking about or trying to ask) and then told me it didnt make sense i could ask to hang with my "" Raggedy friends"" but not ask about important stuff. I told her my hair wasnt important and i ask her out of respect as i could simply just leave and do stuff without asking just as i cut my hair without asking but i dont because it wouldnt be right for me to up and leace without asking.

She told me i have 30 days to find a job and make money to live on my own. Ive applied for 50+ jobs and she has taken me to 2 interviews so it seems pretty clear i wont make it that time frame so homelessness seems to be the next option for me (making it round three of me living on the streets) 

Idk. Should i have just asked? Should i have bit the bullet and kept dealing with my 3/4 permed ugly under cut hair? In my mind im only 19 i know it'll grow back and for a chunk of my childhood she had short hair (that was styled not a buzzcut cut but it was still short) idk.

AITA for buzzing my hair without asking my mom?"
amitheasshole,AITA (more like am I a f***ing idiot) for oversharing,0,2025-04-03 18:16:00,13,"Hi. I've been watching a bunch of call me Kris videos and this looked like fun.
So, me (20f) was talking with some dude (18m) off a dating app. Was talking for like 2-3 weeks I think, about 300 mesages sent back and forth through the app, text, and insta. Somehow I had deluded myself into thinking this guy was interested, even though not a word was said on the subject that whole time. So, I figured I'd say something, and I'm gonna blame the ADD for this one. I send the first paragraph of (I think I like you, blah blah blah) and then I ended up sending about 15 paragraphs with everything from childhood friendship trauma to how's the weather? By the way this was about 11pm, and he was trying to sleep. Then I see bubbles, panic, and send (woops, sorry). Next morning get a text back (I really appreciate you being so open and honest, but I can't say I feel the same, not ready for a relationship, sorry) and then precedes to block me from all the social media.
The worst part of the whole thing is how much of a bat lard crazy lady this makes me feel (and the poor dude had to be freaking out). Which is fine, I'm just not cut out for dating. ü§£"
amitheasshole,WIBTA If I Didn't Buy A Shower Gift?,7,2025-04-02 20:47:37,19,"I'm a new employee at a company --this is literally my 3rd week.  I received an email with a link to a baby registry for a coworker.  Said coworker will be transferring out of our department with a couple weeks and I've had maybe 2 interactions with him.

WIBTA if I didn't purchase a gift for this shower?  I have zero intentions of attending and will sign the card that's going to be passed around.

I think forcing coworkers to buy baby gifts is a shitty thing to do, but that's not why I don't want to.  I don't know this guy or his partner at all.  I wish them well but the whole situation makes me very uncomfortable.  At the same time, I don't want to be an asshole at my new job."
amitheasshole,AITA - neighbor constantly letting dogs pee/poop in my yard,29,2025-04-02 13:08:00,61,"I truly need to know if I‚Äôm being a nutty neighbor or this person is rude. My (owned) home splits a lot with another (that one is a rental üôÑ which has a fenced in back yard) that is right behind me with a small strip of yard in between us that is mine. I just planted a bunch of baby trees on my side of the property line for some sense of division. For weeks, this tenant let their dogs out the door unleashed and they run directly to my back yard and peed on my baby trees and they‚Äôre now turning black/brown. Additionally, I found 4 piles of üí© far into my yard. 

After setting up my camera to watch the area, I noticed it happening daily so I wrote a note asking them to please stop letting their dogs relieve themselves on my new plants/leaving poo in the yard & taped it to their door. Didnt say a word, but dogs did stop for a while (it has happened a few more times since). 

Now, they walk them down the driveway to get to the road but on the way lets them pee & jump all over the garden bed & bushes that are right up against my front window AND also goes across the driveway to my other neighbors yard who also has brand new baby trees, and they pee right on them. It‚Äôs gotten to the point my neighbor and I put (small but ugly) garden fencing around his trees & my trees in the back. If it falls over or we remove it, this person lets the dogs go and immediately do it again. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be a total dick of a neighbor, but you have a fenced in yard, and can clearly take your dogs on their walk without bringing them onto our property & relieving themselves on brand new landscaping that‚Äôs now causing them to die. My partner thinks I‚Äôm overreacting. Am I/my other neighbor the asshole for having to constantly ask he stop doing this? "
amitheasshole,AITA for not paying my friend back for something I never asked for?,5521,2025-04-01 08:34:15,280,"This happened like a week ago and it‚Äôs still awkward. My friend and I were at the mall just walking around and we stopped by one of those little skincare booths. The lady was doing free hand scrubs or whatever, and I was just standing there letting her try it on me because it smelled nice. The friend was super into it though, asking a million questions.

I said I wasn‚Äôt buying anything and even stepped away a little, but while I was looking at a display, the friend ended up buying two of the scrubs. They were like $35 each. Cool, whatever. But then as we were leaving she handed me one and was like, ‚ÄúHere, I got one for you too.‚Äù

I literally said, ‚ÄúWait what? Why?‚Äù and she just shrugged and went, ‚ÄúI know you liked it, it‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù I said thanks but also told her she didn‚Äôt have to do that.

Now fast forward to yesterday, she texts me like, ‚ÄúHey can you send me $35 for that scrub when you get a chance?‚Äù I was confused and said, ‚ÄúI thought you were treating me,‚Äù and she goes, ‚ÄúWell I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to pay for both. I assumed you‚Äôd Zelle me later.‚Äù

Ummm what?? I didn‚Äôt ask for it. I didn‚Äôt agree to it. And she literally said ‚Äúit‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù

I told her nicely that I‚Äôm not paying for something I didn‚Äôt want in the first place. Now she‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm taking advantage of her and says she wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if she knew I wouldn‚Äôt pay her back.

So now I feel weird. I didn‚Äôt want it. I didn‚Äôt ask. But I also don‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful.

We had never used it before and i took about 100ug, and for him its 200ug. He was very nice and at the beginning we were just a little bit excited and talking nonsense, but after a while it lost control, dont know why we started to argue with each other and cry, i was afraid i would hurt him and also he would hurt me. So i asked him to call his friend or parents or who else can come to help us and i may go out to ask the neighbor for help.
But he didnt and he just went outside with me and dont know why we went to the stairway and sit there to argue again. He was trying to call 911 and i was so paranoid at that time, the sound of call made me scared and i was trying to take his phone but failed. Then i left him at the stairway and ran back to the apartment and locked the door, after a while he started to knock the door but i was so afraid to open it. Finally the 911 arrived with ambulance and get us in hospital.
After that he said he doesn't want to see me anymore and blocked me everywhere. Am I terrible for doing this?"
amitheasshole,AITA for moving out pf my house,5,2025-04-02 21:30:22,11,"So, I've been living with two dudes for the last 4 years or so, I'm a female. There have been some really good times but we've had our fair share of arguments and bickering. Usually we're able to talk everything through and things are fine. A few years ago I did something really fucked up while drunk and it created a lot of resentment towards me, as well as anger and hurt. This led to a really big blowout recently and we were finally able to talk it through. I've tried my best to apologize and take accountability for the stress and hurt that I caused, but I know it's going to take time for us both to heal. I realize that things won't go back to the way they were immediately but the tension felt like it was starting to lift a little bit. I've been sober for about 18 months now and have been really trying to better myself for me and those that I love. To me this is the best way for me to show just how sorry I am and make sure that I don't hurt the people I care about anymore. 

It's been difficult being in this house for a while now, with the aforementioned situation aside. I've been responsible for picking up, cleaning, and general functions of the house. There is also drinking daily and this environment doesn't feel healthy for me. I've made a lot of positive changes in my life since getting sober and I've taken the time to really try and work through my depression and my trauma. I understand healing is hard and asking for help is hard, but there's not really a want or desire to get unstuck. 

I've been thinking about finding my own place, but never really expected myself to pull the trigger. I was passively looking at places and found one I really love. I came to the realization that I really need a place for myself where I can be responsible for me, and I can curate a safe space for me to continue healing. I gave them 6 weeks notice before our lease is up and was met with ""your positive decision for yourself creates a negative situation for me."" They seem to think that this is decision was malicious, was meant to screw them over, and that I don't feel any remorse. I thought that for how long we've know each other they would know that I don't have the capability to be malicious. This was incredibly hard for me, and had I known sooner I would have told them. One of them won't even speak to me or acknowledge I exist. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about how I've hurt them, and I feel so much shame and guilt for not agreeing to another lease. I really just don't think that my mental health could have survived another year."

Ive been helping her giving, my advice but its always been ignored. The dude she is with has been honestly treating her like shit (Atleast from what she has told me). Ive told her numerous time that she should leave him as he obviously doesn‚Äôt respect her, or atleast call him out on his bs. However she has done none of these things and continues to complain to me about things that he is doing and asks me ‚ÄúWhat should i do?‚Äù everyday. I dont mind her coming to me but when she ignores everything I tell her it just gets to a point where my input is useless. 

I eventually called her out on her bs, and told her the she either needs to start actually considering my advice, or that im just going to no longer say my piece on her situationship anymore. Then she starts to bring up stuff from past relationships and talking stages, and says that ‚ÄúI have no room to judge‚Äù (Mind you im not judging her, im just telling her the truth). 

Honestly i really do wanna help but im tired of getting attacked and reminded of times where i was being i guess ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù.

amitheasshole,AITA for not taking neighbour's parcel?,1245,2025-04-01 15:14:15,127,"Background: I (33M) have one child (5M), for whom I share custody with my ex. I currently live in a 2-bed rental on a quiet street with a row of only 5 other houses along our road. I live on the end of the row.

About 6 months ago, I took in a package delivered for the house at the other end of the row. The package was a heavy box, containing a bag of dog food. Later that evening, the neighbour (38F) came to pick it up. I know she lives alone and offered to carry it for her.

She accepted the offer and thanked me, and as I carried to hers she kept commenting on the fact that I was being a 'gentleman' and it was good to see a 'big strong man' in action. Bit weird but meh, whatever - I'm not that big/strong, although I do go to the gym a few times a week to keep myself in shape. When I got it to hers, she insisted I come in for a glass of water and kept me there for an hour, just chattering on.

The same delivery has come (to me) every month since then. In the evening, she comes to collect, and I carry it over to hers. Each time, she will try to chatter away at me (inside the house, if she can coax me in; or on the doorstep if I can find an excuse not to go in).

Then last month, when she came to collect the package, my son was home with me. I couldn‚Äôt take the box up to her as I was making his dinner. She complained that it was too heavy to carry herself and that it would only take a few minutes. I refused, but offered to bring it up later that evening. She pouted and huffed and went home. Half hour later she posted a note through the door with her mobile number on it and asked me to message when I could bring it.

I had to feed my son, give him his bath, play with him, put him to bed‚Ä¶ Once I‚Äôd done all that, I finally messaged her. She didn‚Äôt reply until the next day, telling me she had been tired and fallen asleep. Then a few hours later she sent through a long, rambling TIRADE. She told me I should have helped, that I was selfish, that I obviously hadn‚Äôt wanted to help her as I could have asked her to stay with my son while I carried it (fair point, though it just didn‚Äôt occur to me in that moment), and that if I really wanted to help her I would have messaged her earlier. This was all sprinkled with some very colourful language.

I was in complete shock. I apologised and said I would bring it to her that evening, which I then did. 

Last week, the day came again for that parcel to arrive. And this time I refused to take it. 

She came banging on the door later in the evening and screamed at me for not taking the package, that she now had to find a way to get it from the company depot and that it was going to cost her a fortune.

Now everyone along the street knows about it. Another neighbour (58M) has made it clear that he thinks I‚Äôm the AH and has threatened to complain to my landlord about my ‚Äúun-neighbourly behaviour‚Äù. I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong here. AITA?"

Last night, around 3am, I get a call from my sister and she says that she snuck out of the house and she‚Äôs really drunk and at a party with a bunch of older people and she needs me to come pick her up and she gave me the address (which was about 45 minutes away).

I was planning on watching C-Span at 4 AM (we live in the West Coast), and calling in to talk about issues, since that is kind of a tradition of mine. Because of this I decided I did not want to go pick her up.

I called my parents and told them where she was and she needed them to come get her. I didn‚Äôt think about it again.

On my break this morning I get a call from my parents saying that my sister is grounded and had her phone taken away from her. They thanked me for calling them.

I go and visit them on occasion. I don‚Äôt really get details of how they are doing unless I go and actually visit or call other extended family members. This is because my dad (60 M) will not talk about the subject at all. 

My dad is withdrawing himself from my aunts and uncles, and will not talk about my grandma and grandpa. When I bring them up to him directly, he doesn‚Äôt have much to say. This probably sucks to go through, and It makes me feel like a shitty son, because it makes me feel like insensitive and like I‚Äôm meddling by talking to other extended family members about my grandparents and my dads condition. My dad won‚Äôt even talk to my mom about his parents dying.

Do I need to stop bringing this up? On one hand I want him to know that it‚Äôs okay to talk about and he has someone there for him. On the other, the sensitivity and resistance and slight annoyance when I do makes me feel like this isn‚Äôt my business and like I‚Äôm meddling. I visited my grandparents this last weekend and wanted to let my dad know how they were doing but decided against it.

So recently I've been feeling shit in the morning because I lack sleep after I'm woken. I decided to tell him to stop spamming at night when I'm trying to sleep but he said just turn on do not disturb.

We had our daughter pretty early on (she‚Äôs 4 now) and yeah, she wasn‚Äôt planned, but we were happy and I have no regrets at ALL. His family, not so much. They‚Äôve always been kinda cold towards me and honestly, I've noticed that they don‚Äôt treat our daughter the same as the other grandkids.

Last weekend, we were at his moms house for a late dinner, and she and my FIL were talking about my husband as a teenager. My mother in law than proceeded to joke in¬†*front*¬†of my daughter saying how he used to be so carefree and go with the flow ""before he had to settle down so fast."" Then she added ""I bet he wished he had more time before jumping into the dad life with an oopsie baby.""

I was pissed.

We ended up leaving soon after that since it was getting late anyways, and that night as I tucked my daughter into bed she asked me what an oopsie baby was. I felt heartbroken for her and basically explained that sometimes people have kids by accident, but that doesn't make her any less special.

After I put her to bed I ranted to my husband, saying I don't want his MIL around our daughter if she's going to be saying stuff like that. The last thing I want is for my baby girl to be questioning whether or not she's wanted.

I said I don't want my family in law at her fifth birthday party next month and I won't be sending them an invite until they apologize for making things awkward. My husband says I'm overreacting over a small comment and I need to relax and not make this a thing.He argued saying I shouldn't overreact a comment she made when she was tired. He told me I'm not allowed to uninvite \*his\* family, especially over this.

Now that we are adults and going to college, my mom still insists that I need to support her. She even told me, ‚ÄúIf she fails out of college, it will be your fault,‚Äù just because I don‚Äôt want to room with her.

I‚Äôve tried to explain that I can still support my sister without being her roommate. I also pointed out that every other student without a twin has to find a random roommate, but my mom insists that I am abandoning her and that I‚Äôm responsible for her.

I don‚Äôt think this should be my problem anymore. I‚Äôm finally excited to have my own freedom and make my own decisions without my mom‚Äôs influence. She always tries to guilt-trip me into doing what she wants, and I usually give in, but this time, I‚Äôve decided to stand my ground and do what‚Äôs best for me.

But the trust i wanted, it never happened because of one mistake i did back then when i was a child. 

So now I‚Äôm struggling physically and emotionally because when I politely ask them for something for example having to overnight for our thesis/research defense they will automatically say ‚Äúno.‚Äù Even when i have a bf or not, the reason they always said to me is ‚Äúyou guys can do it in the morning or afternoon why do you guys always at night?‚Äù Mind you they‚Äôre yelling when telling me this, the reason why we do it at night because there‚Äôs no noise (we all have noisy neighbors) and we all have something to do at morning and afternoon so we (my groupmates) did it at night 

Here in the country i live i always experience traffic, when i‚Äôm not home at the time they expect me to be at home my parents will call me nonstop until i answer their calls and tell them that i‚Äôm stuck in traffic (i don‚Äôt own any vehicles because i only commute) they won‚Äôt even believe me that it was ‚Äútraffic.‚Äù Unless they hear it from somewhere else then they believe me

So now i done things that make them MAD mad like i don‚Äôt go home at the exact time and they‚Äôre telling me things that doesn‚Äôt make sense. To the point i felt like i‚Äôm always grounded, they won‚Äôt even let me go out to get some fresh air

amitheasshole,AITA for not paying my(?) dog‚Äôs vet bill?,2,2025-04-02 22:36:06,8,"I (29) was [illegally] kicked out of my mom‚Äôs home a year ago after months of fighting about how I spent too much time with my boyfriend/not enough time with her. Before getting kicked out, we shared 5 chihuahuas. After getting kicked out, she claimed that they were all hers since all of their paperwork is in her name (despite me spending thousands on them). She refused to let me take any of them with me, and used them as control for several months as I had to ask permission to visit them and would regularly be locked out if I said/did anything to set her off (such as going on vacation to a place that ‚ÄúI knew SHE wanted to go to‚Äù). 
Fast forward to now‚Ä¶we are on ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù terms (mostly because she is my boss), and I am allowed to visit them at her place whenever I want to. I am still not allowed to take any with me, however (including one that is really attached to me and would prefer to be with me), and cannot take any of them for even just an overnight visit.
The one that would prefer to be with me has been having behavioral issues such as being aggressive to the others, and seems to have a lot of anxiety/restlessness (probably due to the fact that she has a lot of energy and does not get out of the house whatsoever‚Ä¶not even to use the bathroom. The only time she gets out of the house is when I visit and take her for walks). The other day my mom hit me with saying that she needs to go to the vet to be put on medication, and asked that I pay her vet bill. I was completely caught off guard since she seemingly isn‚Äôt my dog anymore, and all I could think to respond with was ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just give her to me instead?‚Äù This obviously was not the response she wanted, so she proceeded to give me the silent treatment for the rest of the day.
I feel bad because I care a lot about those dogs and it breaks my heart to see this one in particular being cooped up inside day in and day out and not getting to be with the person she would be most happiest with (and likely not need medication with since I‚Äôd give her the attention/exercise she is craving). But I also don‚Äôt think the answer is for me to hand my mom any more money than I already have, only for her to medicate the dog and put a band-aid on her symptoms.

I wasn't ready so I didn't go. I came to school at the usual time and when I saw her and went to say hi she just told me im not responsible. I got mad, because she also ""forgot"" about the meeting and called ME out, but I didn't say anything. Later I took her phone as a joke and she got really mad at me, calling me annoying. As I said she's used to me being like this and this wasn't my first time doing this so I didn't know why she made such a big deal out of it. Through the day we didn't talk much but in physics class there was a seat next to me and she said ""I don't wanna sit next to her because she's mean and annoying"". I don't know what I did to upset her so much.

And just to make things clear we don't usually open up to eachother and we never got in any fights. I don't open up to her because once I wanted to but she called me ""a fucking emo"". I'm also not really opened to her since she can't keep things for herself and twisting stories to tell them to our friend group. I can't stand for myself due to my anxiety and find it really hard to speak up about my problems so I never get in any fights.

So AITAH for wanting to stop being friends with my childhood bestfriend?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I complain about someone who I believe is bullying me?,2,2025-04-02 17:56:05,8,"Okay so I (18M) am on my last year of Bachillerato (spanish high school) and i've been in my curent school for 3 years. So basically on the first year I managed to make some friends (I was new to the school and they already knew each other) and I kind of made into a cool friendgroup. 

On my second year, a boy who I already knew about returned from studying abroad and I knew he was best friebnds with some of my friends. Well, I tried to be nice to him, talk to him, and I wanted to build a friendship because I thought he was nice, even though a lot of people told me he wasn't.

Well, turns out he disliked me and I eally didn't catch that, and my firends decided that they weren't going to say anything and so we met up several times with bith me and him being in the same space. I tried to keep it cool, but he started to make some passive aggressive comments about my appearance, me being gay and he became a bit aggresive. Even though, I continued with my ""be nice"" act, and sitll invited him to plans and helped him with studying.

Things started evolving negatively. We have a lot of friends in common and he started playing the victim with everything. One day, he smashed my head against a counter and he told everyone I started it. For the sake of my friendships, I still didn't say anything and tolerated everything.

Fast forward to this year, thinks have started to get worse. I am constantly being pushed, mocked and degraded. He even farted on my face once and he has tried to make me fall by pushing me several times. My friends don't intervene in anything. Some weeks ago, he started shouting the name of someone I liked a long time ago in front of everyone (including said boy), and I tried hard not to cry. I have to have lunch with him because I need to go with my friends bc I don't have anyone else.

He's failing almost everything, he is insecure about many things and I know it, and he might have to repeat this year. Everyone thinks of him as a nice guy. This is important in context.

No one sides with me, I told my friend I was planning on doing this and he started to ramble about how I'm overreacting and how I lack empathy and that he's just like this. My school is quite strict about bullying and, since there's only two  weeks left before Holy Week, finals and SAT preparation and since I won't have to have lunch with him anymore, I was thinking on going to the teachers and explaining everything. So WIBTA if I tell on him, possibly getting him suspended and ruining his chances of still being seen as the school's nice guy and breaking my friendships over this?"
amitheasshole,AITA for wanting privacy after I give birth?,119,2025-04-01 23:19:36,53,"My bf and I were asked to stay by his mother at her home with our baby until we found one of our own. I wasn‚Äôt sure about this idea due to lack of space and privacy etc but agreed when my bf said his mum was talking to her friend about switching rooms as hers was at almost 3x the size of the other room. So he spoke to her about it and In return to switch she wanted a new bed, painting walls and doors to be done, and a few other new furnishing items to which we agreed. After returning with paint and supplies she let us know that even after switching she wants to keep a laundry rack in there to use when she washes her clothes which I was a bit worried about as there will be a newborn in the same room as well as myself recovering in a few short weeks. I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be the most comfortable idea especially when I‚Äôm breastfeeding or baby is napping/ crying etc so I suggested we move the rack to a different area where there is enough space to house it. I figured this would benefit everyone as no one would need to tiptoe or stop their laundry due to a newborn and it would also give me and baby privacy to bond, feed, change etc. my bf agreed and thought his mum would agree that it was for the best for everyone too. When he spoke to her about the idea all I could hear was shouting and when he came back his demeanour changed completely. He started saying things like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt just kick her out of her own room‚Äù ‚Äúso she‚Äôs never allowed in the bedroom?‚Äù And ‚Äúwho cares if there a baby in the room, she should be able to do her laundry‚Äù and other things to that effect. It made me feel like the biggest villain when I just value my privacy and think at such a delicate time that a rack being moved wouldn‚Äôt be an issue? So now I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being horrible for asking for privacy. I completely understand that it‚Äôs her home which is why I was hesitant to live there but she really wanted the baby here and kept asking for us to stay so I‚Äôm just confused over why a small clothes rack being moved is such a big issue. Aita? "
amitheasshole,"AITA for reminding my stepson that if he wants ""THIS"" he needs to do ""THAT""?",495,2025-04-01 15:17:02,103,"AITA for reminding my stepson that if he wants ""THIS"" he needs to do ""THAT""?

My stepson (17M) want ""THIS"" whatever this is. He talks about this all the time. How much he wants it. I, he mom & his dad tell them that if he wants this, he needs to do ""THAT"".

He starts doing that, then realizes that doing that will take time & effort. His mom will sometimes offer to pay for some of the way into doing that when applicable. He still wants this and still talks about getting this but doesn't seem in a hurry to do that to get this.

Why I might be butthole?

When my stepson talking about getting or doing this, I remind him of the that he needs to still do. He then gets upset and tell me that I am making him feel bad for reminding him.  
I tell  him, if wanted this badly, he should be concentrating on doing that. I also tell him, if he wants me to stop reminding him about that, he should stop talking about this.

Why I might not be butthole?  
I want my stepson to have all the this he wants, I just want him to put the effort.  
I am reminding him (only when he brings it up first) as a motivation do the thats he needs to do to get the this.

THIS & THAT could be any number of things.

THIS examples: Getting a LEGO set or a car, losing weight, getting a driver's license.  
THAT examples: Saving money, exercising more / eating less, doing his driving classes & tests.

  
Edit: To those of you below that have left tips or suggestions on how to handle him, thank you very much for those. I will do my best to keep some of them in mind. I appreciate the feedback."
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to not take his bestfriend everywhere?,3,2025-04-02 15:54:07,25,"I (16f) and my bf (17m) have been together for around 7 months. We are really close and I‚Äôm not able to see him a lot outside of school, mostly bc he lives far away and doesn‚Äôt have the money for dates and stuff. At school (well and outside of school) he‚Äôs always with his Bff (18m). And I get it because I also only have one singular close friend, but the thing is, he brings his bff around everywhere. Whenever me and him want alone time just for a couple hours, his bff has to come. When I plan something fun for us, his bff has to come, when I want to play video games with him, his bff doesn‚Äôt play video games but he will stay and try to insert himself in our convos. When it was our 6 months anniversary, I got him a gift (we were both rlly busy with school and wrestling so we decided to go out over the weekend) and invited HIM to sit outside with me so we can exchange the gifts and hang out for maybe 20-30 min before practice. His bff came and kept touching him in front of me, in a way of ‚Äúoh your boyfriend likes me more than you haha‚Äù. I told him about this before and he said that his bff just follows him around even if he just wants to be alone. He said he would try to get to him but his bff is very stubborn. This continues happening and on Monday, I went to see my bf at the park and we were supposed to have a lil picnic. His bff was there. Announced. And I ended up alone. I‚Äôm leaving for a vacation on Monday and I really just want quality time with my bf before I leave, but I think his bff is just gonna follow around. (Also I think this is needed info, but him and his bff live in the same apartment area. I don‚Äôt want to say complex, because they live directly across eachother. So whenever Bf wants to walk over to the park or somewhere, his bff usually just follows.)

amitheasshole,AITA for asking my mom to pay for something that she destroyed when I asked her to stop doing it?,73,2025-04-01 22:10:54,64,"I 20F have a couple starbucks cups I bought and my mother sometimes uses. The starbucks cups must be hand washed in order not to deform them. I told her that if we use them to hand wash them. My favorite cup was put in the dishwasher and is deformed enough where the lid can‚Äôt be able to screw on. I explained that I told her before. I may be in the wrong but I asked since I‚Äôve asked several times if she could pay for it since I didn‚Äôt even need it washed since it already was. If I messed up like this I would pay for it. She told me i‚Äôm a ‚Äútaker‚Äù and i take from paying and never give. She said that if i make her pay i‚Äôm setting the line and she‚Äôll never let me use anything of her and will never do favors for me. We already have a strained relationship since my parents are divorced and hate each other but they live together for my sister till she graduates and she is somewhat mentally unstable since she refuses to take her meds. I also don‚Äôt like the fact that she doesn‚Äôt want to get a job and i had to be the second breadwinner for the family. I‚Äôm sorry for the ramble at the end. AITA?

TLDR:My mom messed my cup up in the dishwasher when I told her many times not to and i‚Äôm asking her to pay for it.     

Edit: Thank you guys so much for responding it means so much that you guys took the time to comment. Just to clarify that cup was purchased at goodwill and I don‚Äôt want the full amount back I just want the 12 dollars that I paid for it 

Update: This happened on April 1st and I was trying to make small talk in order to put this behind us with my mother when i tried to ask if she wanted pizza hut she  completely ignored me i thought maybe she didn‚Äôt hear me but she told my sister she‚Äôs not ready to talk yet. I don‚Äôt know what my dad will do when he comes back on friday so wish me luck again thank you so much for the responses"
amitheasshole,AITA for deciding my girlfriend‚Äôs sisters boyfriend is not allowed at my house for treating her like shit?,227,2025-04-01 15:55:11,63,"My girlfriend‚Äôs sister wants to come visit us at our apartment in the city. The problem is she wants to bring her POS boyfriend. We have to play nice with him while we visit her parents house for her sister, but I don‚Äôt have to do that under my own roof. I won‚Äôt have him here and I won‚Äôt be nice to him at all. I told my girlfriend he‚Äôs not welcome here. She agrees he‚Äôs a jackass, but she wants me to ‚Äúbe nice‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt want to hurt her sister‚Äôs feelings. I don‚Äôt like him and I don‚Äôt like the way he treats her. 

Little context: They have an extremely toxic relationship. They have been off and on for almost 3 years now. At the beginning of their relationship, he was insecure and made her cut off all of her male friends because he had ‚Äútrust issues‚Äù and even after she did that he still didn‚Äôt trust her and threatened to post nude photos of her and put them on the roof of her dads car. Extremely fucked up. Then they got back together?? and it seems like everyone has just forgotten that he did that. But more recently, he decided to break up with her to hookup with another girl but not before asking her if he could still be with her while sleeping with the other girl. Like what the actual fuck? So he did that. Played with her feelings for 3 months then decided he had enough of the other girl and came back. She forgave him. Moved on. Everybody just forgot it happened, again. Then, a few months later. She caught him in New Hampshire at his family‚Äôs cabin with that same girl, alone. And he lied about it to her. Said he was going to this concert thing alone, but he was actually bringing her. 
Completely lied about it and only admitted it when he was caught red handed after she drove to the cabin in the middle of the night because she had a hunch. And thank god she did because If she didn‚Äôt catch him, he probably would have lied more. And now, they are back together. Like nothing happened. And the most annoying part is that everyone and her family still allows him to hangout, still buys him gifts for Christmas and his birthday. Still hugs him and treats him like family. Like what the actual fuck? They are good people. They have good hearts. It‚Äôs not their fault and I know they are just doing it for the sister but I don‚Äôt have to do that. And I‚Äôm not as nice as they are. 


So that‚Äôs my reason. And of course, she wants to bring him when she visits because they are stapled to each other. I won‚Äôt fake nice with him in my own apartment. Not in my casa. Our homes are the one place we get to have peace and privacy away from the rest of the world. As my mother always said ‚Äúmy house, my rules‚Äù and I don‚Äôt let people I don‚Äôt like into my house. I‚Äôm not about to feel uncomfortable and fake a smile with this guy in my own house. No way. I feel like this is pretty self explanatory? "
amitheasshole,AITA- I told someone that we weren't cool and then just left.,0,2025-04-02 21:02:40,8,"Im 36f and to make a long long story short, I was at a bar where an ex friend(31f) showed up to. It's a smallish town and there are like 4 bars, all do Karaoke. I was at Karaoke Friday and end up at a table with said ex friend, we will call Sam. Now I'm not one to stir up shit usually, but what caused our falling out was because I yelled at another friend (35m) who had been fucking with me/there was a rumor that he was cheating with her on his brother (she is my friends now ex girlfriend). Now I was in the wrong are stating some of the shit i did because I should have just stuck to my shit, 100 percent gonna own that. I would/have apologized for that. But she turned around and threatened the shit out of me. To the point where I literally just blocked her on everything and moved on. She has never spoken to me about it, and every time I see her she pretends we are cool. I'm not rude or anything, but not very friend either. Basically you say hi or we are with a group of friends I'm not gonna be shitty. Anyhow, enough background. We ended up at a table while I was waiting for my Uber playing blackjack and she is across from me. She finally looks at me and goes are we cool? I straight up just look her dead in her face and say No. Because we aren't and im not going to pretend otherwise. She seemed to get upset and my Uber shows up like two seconds later and I just leave. I was drinking and while not fall down drunk I was past buzzed. I didn't realize to the next morning it was kinda completely dickish, and now how I usually act at all. Am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking why they would spend money they don‚Äôt have?,62,2025-04-01 21:26:05,42,"I (26F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for a year now. We were broken up for about a month because we were both just in different places and needed to regroup. We got back together and now things have drastically changed. Before in our relationship we were fine financially. I would always try to contribute, pay for myself but he insisted to pay for everything I wanted/needed. Even going as far as to bump me out of the way when I try to pay for my items. It would turn into fights because I don‚Äôt want to seem like a gold digger if he‚Äôs paying for everything. Eventually I just have in because he insisted. Now that we‚Äôre back together apparently money is a big issue and he‚Äôs struggling financially to the point where we don‚Äôt even see each other more than once every other week because he doesn‚Äôt have money for gas. I was supposed to spend the weekend with him and asked if we could go on a date because we hadn‚Äôt been on one since we broke up a month ago. He said no and then told me things are going to change a lot financially. I said, ‚Äúso no more dates.‚Äù We called today and he told me his plan financially which basically cuts our dates to zero. Basically stating we can either hang out for a long time and do nothing or we can go to dinner once. 

The part where I may be TA is when he told me his plan I was confused as to where this financial trouble was coming from. Before we were fine and since we broke up he‚Äôs been working a lot more and has gotten a raise so i‚Äôm confused as to where all that money is going. He got another credit card and spent $300 on unnecessary items. I was genuinely confused so I asked, ‚ÄúWhy would you max out another credit card when you‚Äôre already having financial problems? That‚Äôs just another bill you‚Äôll have to pay back.‚Äù He got mad and accused me of being a gold digger and wanting him to spend all his money on me when we‚Äôve literally talked about me wanting to spend my own money in the past. Should I not have said anything? 

UPDATE: We‚Äôre done! After the call where he called me a gold digger I took a few minutes to gather my thought and texted him how much that upset me. He  just said, ‚Äúsrry.‚Äù Literally abbreviated and everything. I said that sorry doesn‚Äôt always fix everything. This is when he blew up. Took it from 0-100. Being extremely disrespectful. I stayed calm because it didn‚Äôt want to make things worse. But this comment took the cake. I asked him why he felt the need to call me a gold digger when all I did was ask a genuine question. He told me that stupid questions get stupid answers. So clearly he wasn‚Äôt sorry. I asked why he‚Äôs being disrespectful when I‚Äôm being respectful and being calm and he told me I deserve to be disrespected. Told me straight up that he has no respect for me and I need to earn his respect. That just told me everything I need to know. I stopped replying. Then he comes back and says he‚Äôs sorry he said it but it‚Äôs my fault he said it because I pushed him there. Absolutely not you‚Äôre not gonna blame me for your temper. I was done. I asked for my stuff back originally but honestly it‚Äôs not even worth the hassle. Just throw it out. He‚Äôs threatening to show up to my job with my stuff. Absolutely not. Just throw it out. Blocked him on everything. Thank you all for your comments. He was definitely no good and this feels like a weight off my shoulders. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not doing my chores due to back pain?,2,2025-04-02 13:39:26,49,"Monday of this week, I (F18) was home early from school. I was cooking something in the kitchen, as I had to sneeze. Immediately after, I felt this immense pain in my lower back. It was like something I never felt before and the pain was so bad, that my movement was extremely restricted due to the pain.

 I immediately texted my mom (F41) and told her about it. When she came home a few hours later, she stormed into my room, screaming at me that my pain can‚Äôt be that bad, that i am just lazy and that I should get up. I was supposed to throw my dirty clothes into the washing machine. I told her, that I really wasn‚Äôt able to, because I couldn‚Äôt lift something or even bend down to pick anything up because of how bad it hurt, but she simply wouldn‚Äôt believe me.

 This fight has been going on for 3 days, and today, she sent me this text: ‚Äû I'm disappointed in you. I thought I raised you to be a reasonable person. But I notice that you think about yourself first and foremost, and everyone else has to suffer. And the worst part is that you probably won't notice it (if at all) until these people distance themselves from you. You know that I love you, you're my child. But right now, it's really stressful and really getting to me.‚Äú

 I then told her that I was so confused that she didn‚Äôt believe me and that I was really hurt that she thought this way about me. She then said this: ‚ÄûAnd that's exactly what you don't understand. 
Of course I believe you, but you're also forgetting that I work in orthopedics and I know exactly what I can and can't expect from you. Stop lying to yourself and terrorizing others, just be honest. You're just lazy. And I'm the only one who has the courage to tell you the truth. Maybe it's better if you stay with your boyfriend for the time being. I can't stand your ingratitude.‚Äú 

And after a few other messages she said this: ‚ÄûOh my gosh, can you imagine what it's like when you're more or less told that you're doing everything wrong and are always wrong about everything, and you're always looking for your own mistakes and then at some point you think how bad you really are, even though you really only want the best and never wish anything bad for the other person. 
And yet I still doubt myself and I'm fed up with that. I know exactly what I've done for you and that I am and have always been there for you, and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise. Otherwise it will destroy me.‚Äú Mind you, I did not accuse her of any of these things during our conversation or at any time before. I just want to know people‚Äôs opinions on this? I don‚Äôt know what to think of this."
amitheasshole,AITA for hindering my flatmates,5,2025-04-02 11:27:26,53,"I built a house and have housemates(paying considerably cheaper rent) living with me as I work away, and prefer someone to be at the house for security and the extra money is extra coin in my pocket at the end of the day.

I'm a single guy, late 20s and work away in a well paying job. I've got a couple living with me and I'm nervous I've overshot the mark by removing the lead to the theatre TV where they spend majority of their time while I'm away at work.

For context, they have their own bathroom and end of the house and I havent cooked for myself or watched anything in the theatre for over 12 months as I feel I shouldn't need to ask for use of the kitchen or theatre when I'm home. I understand it's their house too, they pay to live there and I spend majority of my time outside in the shed working on whatever projects, drinking beers and smokin cigarettes.

However whenever I want to cook or use the theatre I would have to ask for them to move somewhere else and its driving me insane, so I remove myself and go to the shed, even if I have guests.

I am the only one that looks after outside. Whether it be mowing lawns, pruning trees, weeding gardens, picking up leaves or maintaining retic sprinklers, everything. I often mop floors, unstuck the dishwasher, dust or whatever just to keep the house in a tidy, respectable fashion. I don't know how often they do this as I work away but it seems to be the same state as when I lived alone.

I pulled the plug to the TV in the theatre(still have a nice loungesuite) and hid it before I went to work as I believe that's the reason nothing is being achieved in the house. They cook tea and leave dishes and whatever else in the sink with oil all over the benches and make it a nuisance to use while they're watching TV in the theatre(they do clean up before bed but that's after when I'd like to eat).

Their bathroom is always full of her beauty stuff and whatever all over the vanity which have the sole use of. I understand she's a woman and they need this stuff to doll themselves up, look after their skin, whatever, and that's fine, but why can she not put them away and remove the coffee cups, open blocks of chocolate, hair clips, hair removal etc stuff and put it away. I have gone to others house instead of inviting them over because I'm house proud and don't like people using the bathroom/toilet in the state it's in.

I cannot imagine what the house looks like while I'm away so I try not to build an image. Theyre nice people but have never accepted responsibility for anything. ""Bins not being full enough to take out"" so they stink the property out, 'Forgetting bin day' etc. Theres always an excuse and I'm starting to think im being taken advantage of. Please give some guidance because they're really nice people, but I have given years of my life away for this house, and to have it not respected for the relatively cheap price they're paying seems a bit of a joke."

While here, we had our two kids aged 2 and 10 months. Although we make a decent living, we are big planners and enjoy knowing what we have coming up. This year, we made the decision to only go back to visit our family and friends in Canada either in December or January 2026 because that‚Äôs when we would have time off from work and my boyfriend‚Äôs handball league, as well as be able to maximize our visit to around 3 week‚Äôs time. As you can imagine, flying over 8 hours with two young ones isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart. 

Last week, my boyfriend‚Äôs brother and gf decided that after 17 years together, and two young kids (aged exactly like ours), they wanted to get married! Yay!!! Except, they wanted to do it ASAP this SEPT OR OCT. they are telling us that they won‚Äôt have the wedding without us and that our presence is super important to them (they don‚Äôt have any friends and my bf would be the best man). In normal circumstances this would be something so exciting and we would be over the moon to help them plan.

The issue we have is, in September, our eldest starts his first year at German Kindergarten (huge change from daycare) and our youngest starts daycare (in Germany this is a 4 week progressive integration which must be done without interruption if I am to start back to work in October), I will be starting work and my boyfriend will be starting his new position at work. Not to mention the fact that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay in Canada for more than a week since my bf plays handball competitively and the season starts in September as well. We would also need to pay for a place to stay for the week as well as purchase airfare during high season.

I know some might say that 6 months is sufficient time to plan, but for us, not only is the timing really inconvenient, we feel like their reason for doing it right away and not postponing based on the fact that they don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll be pregnant or postpartum next year, is such a weak argument. Everybody else attending is so flexible, and they are saying our presence is so important, yet they are not willing to move the date a little bit more because of a hypothetical scenario. 

My main issues are:
- timing is very difficult for us
- big expense for a visit we won‚Äôt be able to fully enjoy
- we would be going back home yet be unable to do much else than attend and participate in their wedding festivities

Please help!!!"
amitheasshole,AITA: my cousin moved into our house and my parents expect me to act like her servent,1122,2025-04-01 04:16:56,67,"ok, so i (f18) am a senior in high school, and my cousin (f12) just moved from india with her parents. i live with my younger brother (15) and two parents in a house big enough for us, but with seven people now, it‚Äôs getting cramped. for the first two months after they moved in, she slept in my room, and her parents stayed in our guest room. for context, my room is the smallest in the house. we made a makeshift bed for her, but it eventually got to the point where i couldn‚Äôt even move around in my own room.  

eventually, her parents got jobs and relocated to another state but allowed her to stay with us since she had already enrolled in school here and wanted her to finish the year. i've really tried my best to accommodate all of her needs and help her with her homework. i constantly asked what she was learning in india so i could compare it with the u.s. curriculum and teach her what she needed to know. i helped her study for tests, write emails to teachers, explained homework, and helped pick out her clothes when needed. i moved her clothes from my closet to the guest room and tidied up so my parents wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the room being messy after my uncle and aunt left.  

now, the issue is that my parents expect me to drop everything and help her whenever she has a problem. i don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt ask my brother, or why she doesn‚Äôt just look up the answers to her questions herself, like how to solve a math problem or who the 12th president of the u.s. was. i don‚Äôt get why i have to help her write notes or memorize flashcards. i liked talking to her at first, i haven‚Äôt seen her for six years, but it‚Äôs getting exhausting. i can‚Äôt pretend i want to sit in her room for hours every day talking about things i don‚Äôt care about.  

so, i stopped. i started locking my door, putting on earbuds when i study, leaving for volleyball practice earlier, and going out with friends more, especially since it‚Äôs my last year of high school. i tell them i‚Äôm busy with college stuff, but it‚Äôs reached a point where my parents are noticing and have had a talk with me. they say i‚Äôm acting antisocial and making her feel left out. they say i don‚Äôt go out of my way to treat her kindly, which i did. but i seriously can‚Äôt keep this facade going. it‚Äôs my last year of high school, and i don‚Äôt want to keep telling my friends i can‚Äôt hang out because my cousin is bored.  

my brother comes home from basketball practice, does his homework, and plays video games with his friends, and no one says anything to him. the thing is, i don‚Äôt even think she wants to talk to me that much either‚Äîshe locks her door, watches tv on her ipad, and calls her friends and parents occasionally. so i don‚Äôt even feel like i‚Äôm doing anything wrong, but my parents think otherwise. sorry if this feels like i‚Äôm rambling (i am), but i‚Äôm just so frustrated that my parents think my whole life now has to revolve around my 12-year-old cousin.

amitheasshole,AITAH for kicking my cousin out of my engagement party,375,2025-04-01 10:09:46,73,"
So, I (25F) recently got engaged, and my fianc√© (27M) and I decided to host a small engagement party at my parents' house. I invited a few close friends and family, but I didn‚Äôt invite my cousin, who has a history of being rude and disrespectful at family gatherings. 

A few years back, she made a hurtful comment about my weight at a family reunion, which really upset me. Since then, she‚Äôs continued to make snide remarks about my life choices and relationships, often joking at my expense. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her about her behavior before, but she never takes it seriously and just laughs it off.

On the day of the party, I was excited to celebrate with my loved ones. My cousin shows up uninvited with a couple of her friends, acting like she owns the place. I was shocked and felt uncomfortable, especially since I‚Äôd made it clear she wasn‚Äôt welcome. When I asked her to leave, she got upset and started making a scene, saying I was being a snob and that family should always stick together. 

Now, my family is divided. Some think I was right to stand my ground, while others believe I should have let her stay since it‚Äôs family. AITA for kicking her out?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA for taking my brothers new cat from him?,30,2025-04-01 22:59:20,70,"EDIT: We have taken the kitten to the best vet/shelter in our area!! My mom finally agreed with me and decided to find a good shelter, no matter how far out from our house, that could help the kitten as much as they can, promise not to euthanize it for space, and also rehome her once she‚Äôs healthy!! We did it while my brother was at school. Thank you all for your advice and affirmation, here‚Äôs to hoping she recovers and can be placed with a nice loving person/family!


My brother (20M) recently brought home a small injured kitten that I (21F) and my mom (63F) immediately fell in love with. We all thought she was adorable, but noticed my brother was being very weird about the cat. When I first saw her she was so small I couldn‚Äôt even tell how old she was, maybe around 4-7weeks. She was extremely scared and constantly crying and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone touch her. She was also limping and moving her leg in a very weird way. 

I asked my brother where he found her and what was wrong with her leg and he said, ‚Äúit was stuck underneath my girlfriend‚Äôs car seat and I tried to get out for over an hour but I got tired of trying so I yanked her out.‚Äù

At this my heart dropped. I asked him how he was going to take care of her and he just shrugged and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù My brother does not have a job and he is currently in school for HVAC. Cats that young (so I‚Äôve heard) can‚Äôt be left alone for longer than 2-4 hours at a time!! 

I asked him where she was going to stay, he said he would keep it in his room. When I went into his room it was filthy with old food boxes and bags and bottles of piss scattered all over the place. I asked if he wanted help cleaning the room, he refused. I asked if I could give the cat a flea bath, he said no. I again asked how he was going to fund taking care of her without a job or time to properly take care of her and he  got upset.

When he was at school today I got off from work and checked on the kitten and she was sleeping in the litter box but hasn‚Äôt used it and hasn‚Äôt touched any of the kitten food that I bought her to hold her over. 

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole. 

I told my mom that I was thinking about taking the cat to the Houston Humane Society or Mission for Paws or somewhere that has the capabilities to care for her in the way that she needs and can find her a home that suits her without my brother knowing, because I think if he knew he‚Äôd get pissed and run away with the kitten. 

My mom got really pissed and said it would be wrong of me to do so, and that it would be an asshole thing to do, but I disagree. 

I feel that it‚Äôs cruel and inhumane to keep a small animal with a seemingly broken leg and fleas in a small dirty room with no medical attention!! 

So would I be the asshole for taking my brother‚Äôs new cat to a humane shelter without him knowing??"
amitheasshole,AITA Can I play music in an apartment with thin walls?,0,2025-04-02 23:47:02,17,"This morning I was playing music at a normal volume while getting ready for work and heard my upstairs neighbor stomping on the ground, and when I stopped my music he stopped... I'm not entirely sure if that was him trying to tell me to shut it off or if he was just like moving furniture, but he's complained to the landlord about me twice before and if he does it again I'm probably gonna be in trouble with the Board of Education (my employer who arranged my housing for me). This guy even talked about considering moving out because of it, and the BoE told me if that happens we will have a ""compensation problem"".

Before, I understood it. I was having friends over and we weren't as quiet as we could've been, sometimes on work nights, and so I stopped having guests over entirely because of it. I don't know what I should do, I really don't feel like it's reasonable that I shouldn't be able to listen to music or watch tv in my own apartment. Now I feel kinda paranoid. Everything I play is at a volume where if I walk to the kitchen 10 feet away I can't really hear it anymore. Should I really just use headphones for everything now?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I told my coworkers to stop talking about my body?,70,2025-04-01 18:51:58,90,"24f here. 

For years, I have been body shamed by my coworkers, they will always got out of their way to criticize what i'm eating, call me fat, thunder thighs, fat face, asking me if im pregnant etc. 

A little over a year ago I lost a lot of weight and went from a size 12 to a size 4 in 5 months. Now I am back to my normal size, after being out from an injury and also I had been slowly gaining weight back due to the fact that I am just in a better mental space now. 

 I have asked my coworkers to stop talking about my body when I was losing weight rapidly, when they were encouraging me to lose more and more and they got offended, telling me that they're giving me a compliment, that I should be grateful etc. Before that, I was always body shamed for being ""fat"".

Yesterday was the third time that someone had remarked on my weight the past month. 

One of my coworkers looked me up and down and asked me why I was big again, if I couldn't stop eating, why I had let myself go, asking me what various foods I couldn't stop eating  etc. I did not say anything and ended up leaving anyway because my shift was up. 

I didn't know what to say, this woman literally just came back from having a baby and that's what she wanted to say to me after being out?

I know that it is partially normal because I live in Hawaii, and people here tend to be comfortable saying UNPC things to people's faces without consequences. However, it's unprofessional in a work environment regardless. 

These people know that, and they don't care. However, whenever I tried to speak up about it I get accused of trying to change the culture. Not only that, but i'm these people's supervisor, so it's strange regardless of culture.

amitheasshole,WIBTA for telling my younger sis to hide in the closet,1,2025-04-02 17:46:01,7,"Last night me and my sister went on an errand and she dropped me a ""do you have a crush on a girl?"" on me. I panicked and lied about it. I AM GAY, but my family is not accepting of it, I follow a golden rule of not coming out until I can be independent because my family is crazy religious and they might kick me out and  I cant handle the judgements. 

Then she followed with ""I have a crush on a girl classmate."" I did not expect that at all and panicked and lied even more. I do though have a history of yapping about having a girl crush but joke about it immediately to brush it off. This time though, I said that I am aromantic and only have ""crushes"" in an aromantic way like I just like the way they look. 

After lying to her like this, I felt bad and didn‚Äôt know what to do about it. I felt that she was asking for an advice of some sort. 

She‚Äôs also religious, so I don‚Äôt know how to explain that it is wrong from a religious perspective but not necessarily from a human one. I am torn between telling her the truth and giving her my advice of hiding in the closet for now and to not tell our parents (I know its a bad advice but I dont know what else to say to her) or just letting her handle it by herself. I dont want to hurt her since she is still very young. I genuinely dont know what to do or say that will help her it might become a butterfly effect where I thought I was helping but I actually wasnt. What should I say to her?

amitheasshole,"AITA for telling a friend to piss off and find some other chew toy after I ""disrespected"" her for sending her a message on Steam?",0,2025-04-03 03:28:12,6,"We were friends for a long time. About 3 years. Recently she expressed a want to play Baldur's Gate 3 Co-Op with me. I thought yay, that sounds fun, been meaning to buy it and that sounds great. But recently, I sprained the fuck out of my ankle, and whilst I was at home nursing it, trying to let it get better, I saw she was playing Dead by Daylight. All I sent her was ""Don't die, pretty Ashley! <3"" ...



And this apparently set her off. Because she told me once ""I don't like getting Steam messages."" Okay, sure, whatever, I went and forgot that constituent that apparently only recently surfaced, and I was in pain, I wasn't thinking about it, just a ""have fun, don't die"", y'know, regular Steam message.



""I've told you before I hate getting Steam messages. You can Discord me just fine, you knew this, and you sent the message anyways. Now you're playing the victim card. You're known for annoying people until they get annoyed with you, and that's why I removed you from my Friends List on Steam.""



Didn't remove me from her server or from the Discord Friends List. But just silently removed me, freaked me out, made me feel like shit - I thought I genuinely did something to offend her... and it was this.



And this has been going on for some time. This seemed to be some grudge from when I moderated a friend of ours' Twitch, and I found a way around Channel Point payment for redeeming soundbites. I jokingly said ""I have the power to make all the sounds!"" and they BOTH thought I was going to troll. And I was their friend for YEARS long before that incident even happened, and I never once just kept spamming sounds. I tried to time them for comedy.



Like the reverb fart.mp3 being played when a gust of wind happened in a game or something. Something stupid, comedic, and hilarious. That's my game, making people smile and laugh.



So I stood up for myself, I went through 8 years of a toxic relationship that turned out to be a catfishing, and eventually I found the power to say ""fuck you, I'm not being your toy, I'm out, twat-waffle"" and I did the same with Ashley.



She kept repeating ""You fucking knew it pissed me off and you did it anyways. You just did, never thought,"" I WAS IN PAIN ENOUGH TO BE SENT TO URGENTCARE AND HAVE XRAYS. Sor-ry!



So I sent her ""I'm not putting up with your petty horseshit. Removing a friend over something as innocuous as a Steam message is beyond fucked in the head. It's petty. It's bullshit. You NEVER had a problem with it before. I'm done. I'm out. I did nothing wrong.""



And I can't help but feel like I was the asshole in the end, but that's literally all it was ""Good luck, have fun"" THE MOST SAID PHRASE AMONGST GAMERS.



I'm wondering if this is some petty grudge against me over that ""incident"" or her despair over some guy she has a crush on going into the military soon, and I'm just some nearby ""acceptable target"" because she never confessed to him or some shit, but she didn't want to talk like a functioning adult."
amitheasshole,AITA for coming home late,10,2025-04-02 06:05:38,14,"Disclaimer: even though this post includes my girlfriend, I am not seeking relationship advice, and don‚Äòt think I am breaking the rule.

Hello dear AITA community,

My girlfriend and I have been happily living together for a while now. We both work ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 9-to-5 office jobs. Usually, we wake up at 7:00 AM and go to bed early enough to get at least 8‚Äì9 hours of sleep. Getting enough sleep is especially important to my partner.

Recently, I became active in a band, which basically means having one or two rehearsals per week. The rehearsals take place in the evening‚Äîcurrently one on a weekday and one on the weekend (Sunday evening). On rehearsal nights, I sometimes don‚Äôt get home until after 11 PM, and sometimes even as late as midnight.

By that time, my girlfriend is already in bed. I try to sneak into our apartment as quietly as possible and disturb her as little as I can‚ÄîI don‚Äôt turn on any lights, etc. There‚Äôs no drinking or smoking at rehearsals, so I come home in a completely normal state.

Still, this causes friction because she says she can‚Äôt sleep when I‚Äôm out that late, or that she struggles to fall back asleep if she wakes up when I come home. Additionally, she complains about the amount of time I spend with the band.

I love her and want to find a solution to this situation, but I also don‚Äôt want to restrict myself too much when it comes to my hobbies.

I just wonder: Am I the bad guy for sometimes coming home late and spending time with my bandmates?"

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my wife she can‚Äôt cook?,8791,2025-03-31 16:48:11,1392,"I (29m) have been with my wife (28f) for 8 years, and meals are just about the only place of contention in our marriage, but I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôs going to kill someone one day.

Background - we split the cooking in our house 50/50, but when she cooks I feel like I have to watch her like a hawk. She undercooks just about everything, especially meat, and no matter how many times I try to politely correct her, she claims I‚Äôm being ‚Äúpicky‚Äù. 

For example, every time she makes rice, I just can‚Äôt convince her it‚Äôs 1 part rice to 2 parts water. She always says ‚Äúare you sure? That seems like a lot of water.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs how you like it, but I don‚Äôt want it so mushy‚Äù. The package and google won‚Äôt convince her either, and I just swallow my pride and eat the crunchy rice every time. It‚Äôs like that with everything. Pasta, veggies, bread, meat‚Ä¶

The thing is, I wouldn‚Äôt care so much if it was just me, but she always wants to cook for our friends. She really prides herself on her cooking and wants to make everything herself. I just trail behind her, trying to make sure it‚Äôs all edible, but there‚Äôs usually a few dishes that end up drastically over salted or undercooked. Our friends will politely eat, but I noticed they‚Äôve been coming to fewer and fewer invitations for dinner.

Things all came to a head the other night when she went to put some chicken in the oven as I was hopping in the shower. When I came out, she had pulled the chicken out and said dinner was ready. I was skeptical and told her that it had only been like 10 minutes. She said she pan-seared it first so it was fine, but when I came to look, the sides were literally pink.

I snapped a little and told her she‚Äôs going to kill someone one day from serving them raw meat. Can‚Äôt you see that it‚Äôs pink? That‚Äôs food safety number 1. She said she thought it was done, and it‚Äôs not her fault, her mother never showed her how to cook chicken growing up. I then told her ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre almost thirty, that‚Äôs no excuse for not knowing how to cook at all.‚Äù

Needless to say she was pretty upset with me, and I probably could‚Äôve been nicer. But I‚Äôve been nice about it for 8 years and nothing has changed. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA For Trying To Charge My ex best friend after we stopped being friends,0,2025-04-03 01:00:11,6,"   So and Jasmine and I were best friends one day I got called out of p.e this was like maybe a week before Halloween. I don‚Äôt know why but I saw Jasmine who didn‚Äôt have the same period as me. And Rita which is one of her friends and I went with them to Mr.V‚Äôs office. (The dean) Jasmine said she didn‚Äôt want to be my friend so I started crying a lot like I couldn‚Äôt breathe cause at the time I couldn‚Äôt be happy by myself and like I needed friends to hang out with. 

   But she was mad cause I made a slideshow saying red flags and green flags abt her and shared it with her the Friday before. (This all was happening on a Monday) I only did it cause when I opened canva I never check my notifications so I decided to and when I did I saw she made a slideshow about me saying mean stuff abt me how I‚Äôm lazy and a slow runner. I saw it as a joke but part of me thought she was mad cause I sit in the middle in Art and her chair is special when we came in our chairs got switched and she got pissed at me over a different chair.  Anyways I apologized a lot cause I didn‚Äôt check when she made it and it was when we were both making slide shows. 

   Rita was there for some reason even though it was none of her business and it‚Äôs not like I had an option to bring someone. Jasmine kept saying I had no friends which wasn‚Äôt true I just didn‚Äôt hang out with people at lunch or nutrition. And Mr.V kept pulling me out of 7th period to say don‚Äôt mess this up and shit. Mr.V is close with Jasmine and Rita because Rita‚Äôs mom is a teacher at the school. Which made me feel like well she messed up not being friends with me. Then I realized I didn‚Äôt want to be her friend as much anymore but we were supposed to match for Halloween. I was still excited because I wanted to match with her even though i didn‚Äôt like the outfit. I was so paranoid that she would come in uniform and I would feel like shit and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. I was the only one who like bought clothes she used stuff she had before and my mom had to buy the hat for me and her. 

    So I felt bad for my mom I asked her because she was ignoring me and she said her mom didn‚Äôt want her to match with me but she brought the hat. So that made me more happy but then she said she‚Äôll only wear it in classes we don‚Äôt have but that made no sense to me she only wore it when she had to do Art and have a costume for the costume contest. So I told her that she owes me $7 because my mom had to pay for that and you didn‚Äôt even use it she took it off after a little. So I started asking the next week I didn‚Äôt want to make her angry angry at me so I asked like 2 weeks later. 

    Thanksgiving break was coming so I texted her asking and saying that i could help her buy the new shirt she needs for a class. The teacher said if we collected bottles she could sell it for us counting it as money, I was offering to help with the bottles. She got mad at me that I didn‚Äôt say hi to her and I said sorry a lot took accountability but she was just being rude to me even though she knew what happened. So I realized I don‚Äôt want to be friends with her if she makes me want to cry myself to sleep. I also realized the money doesn‚Äôt matter I just want her to leave me alone.

amitheasshole,AITA For Cussing Out My Elderly Grandmother For Having Cancer,0,2025-04-03 00:37:05,14,"(excuse low karma, i usually just watch narraration videos like emkay but made an account to post this)

(also sorry this is gonna be a fairly long post üíÄ)

Allow me to set up some context, as I'm sure the title alone makes me look like quite the asshole. I'm a 14 year old girl, and my grandparents have custody of me due to my mom's addiction struggles. My grandparents argue all the time. My grandfather has dementia and is often very rude towards me and my grandmother, calling us slurs, cussing us out, basically a man child. (abuse is a strong word, which I know as I have endured genuine abuse, so I will not describe my grandfather as abusive, just kind of a dick.) My grandmother, on the other hand, has lung cancer. Keep in mind, as asshole-ish as this is of me to say, it's no one's fault but her own. As probably expected, it was caused by cigarette smoking, she's had lung cancer before, and it wasn't looking great at all, but she miraculously beat it. Insisted that was a sign from God and she would live life to a full potential from now on. Two months in I caught her smoking again. She went for a check-in and they saw cancer again. Every aspect of my life is taking care of my grandpa with his dementia and my grandma with her cancer, I mean, they even started homeschooling me so I could focus on them. Of course, I wouldn't mind helping out, but I mean, like, I'm their personal caretaker. Change grandpa's diapers, help them shower, cook every meal, also do everything regarding the family dog, etc. It's been like this for a little less than a year now. Anyway, my 15th birthday is Saturday, April fifth. We didn't do anything for Christmas or Easter, which both used to be a big deal in our house, and next year my birthday IS Easter day, so I'll spend it in church with my aunt. I was very very excited to have a semi-about me day Saturday, knowing I'd at the very least get a cake (even if I had to pay for it) but that won't be happening, I learned today that I will be spending it in chemotherapy with my grandma. I screamed at her. I called her the nastiest names in the book, told her it's not my job to take care of her, that it's her own fault she's even going to chemotherapy for continuing to smoke even after a close call with lung cancer before, that I shouldn't have to be there for her chemo, and even that I wanted a ""normal"" life and would prefer living with my tweaker mother because ""at least I could have school and friends."" My grandma is crying her eyes out and refuses to talk to me, and my grandpa is talking about how much he wants to shoot me (empty threats but still) I know that I was very harsh, and some of the remarks I made were uncalled for, but am I 100% the asshole??

On the same day, there's a meaningful concert that I would rather go to with a current close friend.

Some background:

This childhood friend is someone that I would consider a close friend up until my last couple years of high school. We went to school together, and I would see them at events outside of school (i.e. church). We've known each other since we were toddlers. As we got older, especially when we got our licenses, we didn't hang out a ton outside of school or church. When I moved away for college we didn't really talk at all, and I maybe saw them a handful of times when I would visit home from college. College was almost 10 years ago now.

A couple of years ago, they had dinner with me and my extended family when I visited our hometown. First time I had seen them in probably 5 years. Earlier this year, they texted me and asked for my address for a wedding invitation. I hadn't talked to them since that dinner a couple of years ago. The wedding is across the country in my hometown and would cost around $1000 to fly just for a short weekend. This person was in my wedding party, but I'm not in theirs, and if I'm being honest, I feel like that's less incentive for me going.

On the same day as the wedding, there's a concert coming to the town where I currently live that is a meaningful concert for me, and a bucket list show. I also would be going with a current close friend. We both agreed if this concert ever happened, we would both be going.

With that being said, AITAH?

EDIT: INFO: I have not RSVP'd to the wedding yet.

EDIT: INFO-This person was in your wedding party (way to bury the lede), but you stopped hanging out with them regularly when you were 16? How does that make sense? --> Sorry for not clarifying. This is true. I still went to school with this person and hung out every day during school through graduation (small school 20 people in my class). I got married at 21 (3 years out of high school). The wedding party was large so naturally some ""old friends"" would still be part of it, even if I wasn't as close with them as I had been. I didn't have enough ""adult"" friends yet. Hope that helps.

EDIT: My friend is the groom."

I have very severe ptsd and I had a really bad flare up recently that has made it difficult for me to take care of myself, my work and household chores (despite being a workaholic and clean freak). 

Last night I had gotten out of a really intense therapy session. Since Im trying to get back to normal as soon as possible I pushed myself hard enough to cause a panic attack. When these happen I may start screaming/hyperventilating/vomiting uncontrollably for hours until I pass out. I hate it. Our neighbors hate it. My roommate hates it. No one wants that. My number one priority is to not put my Roommate and neighbors through that everything else is secondary.

The good news is that I have skills that help me not do that. While doing my Distress Tolerance skills- I saw my roommate message me that food was done. I can‚Äôt stomach anything and he yells at me for not responding quickly. I have to respond ‚ÄúIm sorry I just got out of therapy. Im not gonna eat for a little bit‚Äù and he responds ‚ÄúK we need to talk at some point‚Äù

That is an extra anxiety that prevents me from calming down. An easy fix would be knowing why‚Äúwe need to talk.‚Äù

So I asked- but it just lead to an unproductive back and forth where I keep explaining that I need to at least know if I did something wrong and he just side steps the questions

Now- I can no longer reliably cope and manage the panic. I am in full survival mode, and the talk he wants is not going to be possible today anymore. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Im going to be ready today‚Äù

He responds to that telling me to wash my dishes or he was going to kick me out. (Which idk why he couldn‚Äôt say that when I literally asked him) 

Usually I wouldn‚Äôt respond since- he was obviously not in a good headspace either. However if I ignored him he would start screaming through my door. Again my priority is to not go into a panic attack and Him screaming at me is going to put me in a panic attack.

I tired to communicate that I am in a crisis right now and that I need some time to calm down, but I can and will wash the dishes. I want to cooperate- don‚Äôt worry about them, it will be done. I keep repeating myself.

He keeps responding with a bunch of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äùs, and ‚Äúthats not good enough‚Äù He then starts screaming through the door- and I had a full panic attack.

Now I am getting kicked out because of how pissed off he is about this conversation and the panic attack. From my perspective I genuinely dont know what else I was supposed to do.

Without explaining the context I showed my friend (29m) the texts and he says I was TAH because I was inconsiderate towards my roommates feelings. He believes that if my roommate needed to talk- it‚Äôs likely very important and urgent. And it should have taken priority.

I was taught that you need to be calm before addressing important conversations. But is he right? AITAH for asking for this conversation and the dishes to be delayed?

NOTES- This has been edited heavily to remove biased emotional rambles about how I felt. Keep in mind some comments are responding to that version not this one
‚Äî I washed my dishes as soon as I was functional. They just would have been done way earlier if I didn‚Äôt have a panic attack. 
‚Äî I do not have family or a support system. I wouldn‚Äôt be living like this or paying rent if I had a choice. 
‚Äî I do not medically qualify for inpatient care. That will apparently make my condition worse."
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my girlfriend's older brother that her younger brother might have a brain tumor.,0,2025-04-02 21:13:32,32,"For a little background I've been with my girlfriend for over six years and am close with her brothers. We're all adults.

Her older brother OB is on vacation and called me to see how things are going and asked to say hi to his sister, my GF, as well. I told him I'm good and asked how his trip was going etc then asked him if he heard the news about his younger brother YB. He said no then my GF said, ""Don't tell him he's on vacation!"" but of course at that point it was too late and he wanted to know what was going on. No one had told me not to tell OB about YB's situation, I didn't know that he was not told on purpose and if I was in his situation I would want to know what was going on with my own younger brothers health.

My GF told her OB that their YB got a brain scan and might have a brain tumor. He got upset and said he's going to hang up. My GF is now mad at me that I told OB about his YB's potential medical condition. 

I apologized to OB via text and he said he's glad I told him. So Reddit AITA?

TLDR: I told my girlfriend's older brother that their younger brother might have a brain tumor while he was on vacation. My girlfriend got mad at me for telling him. Her older brother told me he's glad I told him.

EDIT: My GF's family was going to tell OB when he got back from his vacation. I was just unaware that they were waiting until he got back."
amitheasshole,AITAH for setting boundary with my mum?,6,2025-04-02 03:31:56,9,"I, 20F, have lived on my own and been financially independent from my parents for going on 4 years. I am in school and work over the summers to pay for living expenses/rent and use student loans to pay for my tuition. Recently, my mom has been repeatedly messaging me (4-5 times a day) about needing a job and how I should be trying harder to find work. I have had multiple interviews and have been actively applying for jobs for a few weeks now and I have expressed this to my mother but she still messages me things along the lines of 'you'll never get a job if you don't go door to door' or sending me multiple job postings and following up with a 'you need to try harder'. I have now told her that I would keep her updated with how the job search is going but would appreciate it if she would let me do so on my own. I told her I understand that she is coming from a place of love but she is adding a lot of pressure to a situation that I don't feel requires it. This has been especially frustrating since I am in finals season and I am already extremely stressed as it is. She took offense to this and has been icing me out since. AITA? "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I stopped training a friend because he is getting too cocky?,5,2025-04-02 05:05:14,14,"Hello everyone, my dilemma is as follows: I am a competitive Yugioh player (3 times regional champion and multiple tops at intenational events), and I got kinda popular in the region I played. However, I focused too much in the tournaments aspect and didnt focus on actually engaging with people. Therefore, I tried to expand my inner circle and teach a player that seemed interested in engaging with me. 

That started some months ago. Now, because of the training, this friend of mine started to get really good at Yugioh tournaments. However, he is becoming really cocky due to his improvement in the game, and I fell kinda dissapointed. Also, I feel like I have a part on it because of how good he is at the game know, so I was thinking about stopping our testings.

I kinda hinted the idea to him, but told me I was being an asshole for suggesting it because a real friend wouldnt do that. Also, that is because this ""exclusive"" behavior of mine that not a lot of people like me in my regional community and would prove to all of them that I am an asshole if I stop our testing. 

Thank you for the feedback. "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my MIL she needs to back off?,326,2025-04-01 04:54:48,41,"I 28(f) have 3 children, 9(m), 5(m) and almost 1(f). My two boys are from a previous relationship and my husband is the father of our daughter. For context, we live with MIL due to her needing help with bills. I love my MIL, she's been a great support system and loves the kids but she has an issue with interfering a little too much. 

Whenever there is a problem with the older kids ( them not listening, talking back, doing something they know they shouldn't be) she needs to get involved. Even before my husband or I try to take care of the issue ourselves she trys to be the parent. When we do correct them she still needs to always put her 2 cents in and also tells us what she would do instead. We've also caught her not listening to us as far as rules we've set in place and things we've asked her not to do. For example, we've asked MIL not to place our daughter in MIL's bed for a nap because she can wake up at any moment and decided to crawl off but she continues to do so. That's just one example. 

We continuously tell her we are the parents and need to be the ones to parent first, unless we aren't around to do so at the moment. She also does little things like calls our daughter ""her baby"", has seen something my daughter is wearing and has said ""I have something just like that, I could put it on and we could match"" has said how much my daughter resembles her and she even mentioned to me one day how she ""accidently"" told my daughter to ""come to mommy"" when she was on the floor crawling.

 The last straw was when she had our daughter on her bed and my husband was standing in the doorway of her room, our daughter was crawling around and got a little too close to the edge for my husband's comfort, so he reacted and reached his hands out and slightly launched himself to the bed. MIL started yelling at him about how ""she's fine, I was right here"" etc and my husband told her she's his daughter and it made him uncomfortable. MIL then continued saying "" how do you think you survived as a baby"" etc. 

I lost my cool, I heard everything from the kitchen and stormed to her room, grabbed my daughter and told her she needed to back off and stop playing a parent role, she's not my children's parents, she's their grandma, and if we're not comfortable with something she needs to respect that. It's been super tense in the house the last couple of days,AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for already practicing an audition piece before it was given?,568,2025-04-01 01:09:01,97,My high school has 4 bands in total and the top two bands require auditions while the bottom two do not. We recently received our audition pieces and I was surprised to see that our etude was a piece I learned over the summer. The piece is from one of the ‚ÄúRubank Advanced‚Äù books and over the summer I learned the whole book solely for the purpose of practice and not to try and give myself an advantage against my peers. The piece is only about 20 measures long and we are given 2 months to learn it along with some scales. I told my friends about how excited I was that I knew the piece and I might be able to get into the top band and they all replied that I should be given a new piece because it isn‚Äôt fair to everyone else. I felt bad and even talked to my directors about it and they said that I don‚Äôt have an advantage because I didn‚Äôt know that the piece was going to be given I just happened to practice it. Even after telling this to my friends they still agree that it isn‚Äôt fair to the other people auditioning and that I‚Äôm a selfish asshole for thinking that it is. Am I the asshole?
amitheasshole,AITA for not befriending the new girl,29,2025-04-01 16:38:55,9,"In our school, a new girl, we'll call Jane, joined our class recently, and while my friends found her annoying and distant, I felt bad and treated her kindly. She seemed happy but quickly became very touchy, grabbing my shoulders, back, and hair even when I asked her to stop. She also talks over others and doesn‚Äôt let people speak. My friend said that she's doing things that friends with a long relationship do.

During a theater project we had, she was added to me and my friend's group. We had to make Mini Stage designs. She kept whining about being uncreative and bored, then took my friend‚Äôs cutter and tried to take over her task. When asked to return it, she refused, saying she could do it better. They had a passive-aggressive fight until my friend took the cutter back. Jane then refused to help and kept criticizing our work while laughing as if she meant it harmlessly.

Afterward, my friends insisted we stop talking to her, and I went along. Now, she‚Äôs trying to befriend the other girls and occasionally talks to me. I stay friendly but distant and dry. I feel bad since I can see how left out she feels in group projects and gym class, I was like that too. But also don‚Äôt like her much, and I wonder if I‚Äôm just influenced by my friends."
amitheasshole,AITAH for not agreeing with my gf?,8,2025-04-01 23:34:04,17,"Today in the middle of my (25M) work day my gf (24F) texted me ‚Äúso do you not like me anymore or something; you don‚Äôt ask me about my day or anything‚Äù The text caught me off guard as it was out of the blue. So I replied ‚Äúwhat? Im still at work and I ask u that pretty much everyday‚Äù  She then says I am invalidating her feelings because I wont just admit I dont ask her about her day everyday. But, I do ask her most days (some days I get home when shes asleep. Maybe once every 2 weeks or so)

I have been working extra + have been busy with side work on my day off for the last few weeks, but I have still spent 100% of my free time at home talking or watching TV with her when I am home from work. Last night I was particularly exhausted, so I was quiet and watching TV having a beer when I got home (which is uncharacteristic of me). I knew she‚Äôd feel a type of way about my tired mood so I texted ‚ÄúI am so beat I cant believe I still have 5 more days of work after this‚Äù before I left work, to which she ignored and told me she is going to her friends house. After gf arrived home a couple hours after me she asked ‚Äúwhat are you sad or something‚Äù to which I replied ‚ÄúNo I am just really exhausted‚Äù and I spent the rest of the night resting with her on our couch before turning in early. Usually we talk more but with so much going on I just couldn‚Äôt do anything besides sit or sleep. 

I understand she is asking for validation in her text message, but I feel the way it was done was very inconsiderate and accusatory. I have been putting in as much effort as possible given my current schedule, (cooking for both of us daily, doing chores during my day off, and talking to her about whats going on in her life at the end of the day) so I felt upset over her asking me in this way. I even asked her what more she would like me to do and she couldnt even answer the question. When I explained my frustrations with her question to her she just said ‚Äúok then‚Äù ‚Äúok‚Äù 
It is hard to not feel that she is projecting. 
I don‚Äôt think disagreeing is the same as invalidating, and feel like I am being blamed for her feeling insecure (which she has a history of doing to me) 
Or AITAH and invalidating her feelings?"
amitheasshole,AITAH FOR NOT TELLING MY FRIEND‚Äôs WIFE THAT HE WAS LIVING IN MY HOUSE,1554,2025-03-31 18:26:55,138,"So I (29F) married with a toddler has been friends with Sam (29M) since high school
For context: It‚Äôs a small circle of friends. All boys except for me. We travel a lot. We have never been physical or had feelings for each other it‚Äôs just Platonic friendship. When they got together with their partners we have travelled only with their significant others. And I have been friends with their partners and vice versa.  I meet up with the girls without the boys too.  Sam and his wife Roma (29F) have been together since then. So She became part of the same crowd as well.  
I got married first. And my husband and I have a great marriage. We are happy. The following year others got married too. 
So the drama unfolded last year. 
My husband is away for work purposes. 
Sam and Roma have been married for almost 5 years now . Their relationship has ALWAYS been shitty. Don‚Äôt get me wrong she is a good friend. But their relationship was a mess. She has anger issues and Sam always ignore her tantrums. 
You must think how I know this. They fight In front of the whole crowd for silliest and stupidest things. ARGUE. SHOUTING and what not. 
My friends and I never poked our nose into their relationship, cause I have a  belief that if my opinion is not asked that means it isn‚Äôt required in the first place. 
One day they got into a huge fight, over Sam wanting to meet our mutual other friend (29M) for a game night. Roma got so mad over this and told Sam to move out from the house. (This isn‚Äôt the first she told him to leave) 
Sam thought she‚Äôd come around when her tantrums were over. But everyday ends, her belittling him and shouting. And on the 3rd or 4th day he got a msg from Roma saying that she doesn‚Äôt even want to see his face and a bunch of other crappy things and had packed his stuffs when he went to home after work. 
He got so heartbroken and maybe it was his last straw to work things out. 
On the next day  I got a call from Sam upset and told me all these things. And ask for my help since he doesn‚Äôt have a place to stay. 
I had a spare room. I told my husband and we offered the spare room for rent. 
He works in shift and I do too. So we rarely see each other although we share a roof. 
I told Sam to tell Roma that he lives at my place but he was like only of she asked. 
He was clearly over with her and didn‚Äôt want to get back. Cause after separating he tried multiple times to sit nicely and  talk which ended up is more SHOUTINGS AND ARGUMENTS. He was kinda fed up by then. 
After 7 or 8 months. He filed for divorce. And Roma found out that he was living here. 
She texted saying thank you for helping him and that she‚Äôs glad I was there for him. 
But after 2 or 3 days I got multiple texts blaming me for not telling her and also  implying that we are having an affair. I told her very nicely that she could have just asked me or talked about them having problems, I would have known. And would not hide that fact. But She‚Äôs saying that I ruined their marriage by not telling her that he is living at my place. 
AITAH? "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to comfort a guy who opened up about feeling guilty after using someone else?,21,2025-04-01 17:08:31,38,"I (F, 30s) had an emotionally intense connection with a guy (M, mid-20s). I‚Äôm a single mom with two kids, 7 years older than him. He knew this from the beginning and never seemed to have an issue. We spent nearly all our free time together and had deep emotional and physical closeness.

He used to say things like *‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù* *‚ÄúYou make me so happy I could climb the walls,‚Äù* and *‚ÄúI‚Äôm the luckiest guy in the world.‚Äù* Later on, though, he admitted he wasn‚Äôt really attracted to me, because I‚Äôm older and have kids. He also said that everyone who likes him is either ‚Äúweird or desperate.‚Äù So while telling me I was amazing, he was silently judging me.

Every time I tried to end things, he begged me to stay. Eventually, I blocked him to protect myself.

When we reconnected weeks later, I found out he had slept with a girl who had been in love with him for a long time. He said he didn‚Äôt like her, that the sex was bad, and that he did it only because his self-esteem was low. He also trashed her ‚Äî said she was sick, angry all the time, and that he panicked at the thought of a pregnancy and realized he didn‚Äôt want her at all.

He started calling himself *‚Äúa loser‚Äù* and *‚Äúscum of the earth.‚Äù* I could tell he wanted me to comfort him and tell him it wasn‚Äôt that bad. But instead, I said, *‚ÄúThen stop acting like that. It‚Äôs not a curse. You can change. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy, but it‚Äôs simple.‚Äù*

Then I added, *‚ÄúYou feel bad because your behavior bothers even you. That says a lot. It can change.‚Äù*

I said it calmly and with honesty, but he got upset. Said I wasn‚Äôt listening, that I didn‚Äôt care, that I felt distant. Then he ghosted me completely.

So now I wonder:  
**AITA for not comforting him when he felt guilty and needed support?**

  
EDIT / UPDATE:

Just to clarify: 

The moment I found out how he saw me (as ‚Äúweird,‚Äù ‚Äúdesperate,‚Äù and ‚Äúnot really attractive‚Äù because I‚Äôm older and have kids), I was furious. I was in shock and needed time to process it. I didn‚Äôt try to reconnect emotionally after that. The only reason we spoke again was because I wanted to know how soon after I blocked him he slept with that girl. It felt important to me because I predicted that would happen.

I didn‚Äôt expect his reaction to be a tantrum followed by silence. And didn't expect he would say such horrible things about her. He always played the role of this pure, innocent, wholesome guy. I just realized he is a text book nice guy. I was honestly in disbelief. I thought my brain is glitching or something, and misunderstood him or did something wrong.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my roomate she sucks at communicating?,3,2025-04-02 05:51:46,9,"I am a 19-year-old female have one roommate and two suite mates I share a bathroom and kitchen with. We are all freshmen and have grown close this year. My suite mate, whom I will call Vi, and I are very similarloud, humorous, and empathetic. We enjoy sharing our thoughts and listening to others. Gigi, our other suite mate, is more reserved and seems to struggle with expressing her emotions. Her family dynamics suggest she may not have had the chance to express herself growing up. 
Things were generally good until early February when Gigi started acting withdrawn and short with us. Vi and I were concerned, so we tried to talk to her about what was bothering her. Gigi remained quiet, but when we kept encouraging her to share, she exploded, saying we never let her talk and changed the subject. This surprised us because we always asked her about her day and listened when she expressed her interests. We told her we would try to be better listeners. 

About a month later, Gigi acted distant again. We approached her gently, explaining that we knew something was wrong and expressing our concern. Eventually, she broke down, sharing that even though she considers us friends, she feels very lonely and wants to transfer colleges. She mentioned she would have kept this to herself until the day she moved out. We were shocked because Gigi was a trusted friend, and her wanting to leave affected me personally since she was supposed to be my roommate next year. Gigi was upset by our reaction and decided not to discuss it further, leaving us feeling unsettled. 

Last Saturday, Gigi and I accidentally went on a five-mile hike and forgot our water. We returned to our dorm tired and dehydrated. After resting, I drank some water, but Gigi remained quiet and shut down. Later in the evening, Vi and I tried to talk to her, but she was snarky and hardly responded. When I asked if she was tired and needed space, she insisted she wasn't tired. Uncertain of her feelings, Vi and I decided to give her some space since previous attempts to reach out hadn‚Äôt worked. 

Two days later, after barely speaking, Gigi finally asked why Vi and I had been ignoring her. I was shocked because we thought we were being supportive. I explained our perspective, but Gigi insisted we ignored her, which wasn't true. I arranged a meeting with Gigi and Vi, where I tried to facilitate the conversation. However, Gigi spoke very little during the two-hour discussion. Despite our vulnerability, she claimed she didn‚Äôt care that we had ignored her. This hurt Vi‚Äôs feelings as she felt their bond was being dismissed. 

The meeting changed nothing; Gigi and Vi still weren‚Äôt communicating, and I felt conflicted. Gigi finally spoke to me again today, and I explained how her lack of communication and saying our actions didn‚Äôt bother her hurt us. I urged her to talk to Vi, who is her roommate and close friend. Gigi had nothing to say in response, leaving me feeling awkward and wondering if I was in the wrong. Am I?

amitheasshole,AITA for asking for more sleep?,14,2025-04-01 18:34:05,75,"My husband and I have an 8 week old baby. Of course sleeping is extremely hard with a small baby but for me I feel like it's even harder. I work full time (40hrs) a week I do manual labor lifting heavy products loading and unloading as well as sometimes physically running for an hour or two to get people their orders. I work from 12pm-8:30pm. My husband is on short term disability right now and is at home with our baby full time. What we have been doing for a while is no longer working. Currently I get home at 9pm and we both watch our son, eat dinner, watch TV, ect together until about 11pm then I attempt to go to bed and he is ""on the clock"" with our son until 5am. Anytime after 5 it's my turn. Sounds fine? We each get 6 hours of sleep, fair is fair right? Well it's starting to not feel like it. At night sometimes my son sleeps through my husband's whole shift, although the more typical is he will wake up once at around 2-3 and go back to sleep meaning he potentially could get up to 11 hours of sleep. My son almost never sleeps through mine, he normally wakes up between 5-6 and I cannot get him to sleep any longer then an hour MAYBE two at most. So I am on average waking up at 6am and staying awake until 11pm while also working. That is at minimum, most of the time I can't even sleep in my allotted hours because I have postpartum insomnia. I get 2-5 hours of sleep at most (normally broken up) at night. I am running on empty and I'm missarable. Every time I bring it up to my husband or we try something knew he always says it ""feels unfair"", and gets annoyed. We've tried me doing night time and him morning but I have mental health issues and become delusional and angry when I'm running on no sleep, so it's best if I sleep first. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going crazy 

Note: I don't want anyone saying that my husband should do the entire night alone because he ""doesn't work"" being a stay at home parent is hard work it's mentally taxing all stay at home parents deserve breaks, as well. "
amitheasshole,"AITA if I don‚Äôt invite my stepmother, who had an affair with my father, to my wedding?",827,2025-03-31 19:02:32,302,"Alright guys here WE GO. The background: she is technically no longer married to my father, they got legally divorced for financial reasons (my dad basically doesn‚Äôt want her taking his money) but still live together and don‚Äôt tell anyone they are divorced.

I HATE her and I don‚Äôt say that lightly. The story goes, I met her daughter in 7th grade and we became close friends so her mom and my mom became friends. In 8th grade, I realized her daughter was a terrible girl and our friendship ended because she got a ‚Äúnew best friend‚Äù in 8th grade and would purposely exclude me from activities, sit with her back towards me at the lunch table to talk to her new best friend, etc. 
Unfortunately, her mom and my mom remained friends. THEN, freshmen year of high school: my mom and I find out she is having an affair with my dad. 

So my ex stepmother, was friends with my mom and also has a daughter who bullied me, and had an affair with my dad and got married to him when I was 19 years old. (After my dad tried getting back with my mom twice but cheated on my mom again with my stepmother so my mom finally had him leave)
Since their marriage, she has seen my mom once at the grocery store and called my mom a ‚Äúb**ch‚Äù. Something I will never forget to go along with everything else she already did.
She‚Äôs said rude things about me behind my back, that my dad told me about like ‚Äúgetting a degree in social work is easy‚Äù even though she‚Äôs never been to college but that was in my early 20s. I am 31 now. She also just always looks at me with this ‚Äústank‚Äù look on her face almost all the time. I know she probably secretly hates me because I‚Äôm my mother‚Äôs child and she‚Äôs jealous of course. 
I have to deal with her whenever I see my dad and we just keep it civil. I haven‚Äôt honestly had issues with her in a long time. Her presence just annoys me. She apologized once about having the affair when she was crying to me that my father gets abusive, but I already know and don‚Äôt feel sorry for her. She is such a selfish person and only cares about how she looks to others - fancy clothes, cars, etc.
I have issues with my dad at times.. but he‚Äôs my dad. But he can be narcissistic and has undiagnosed mental health problems.
My dad has told me numerous times they do not love each other and are only together for financial reasons.

Do I invite her to ‚Äúkeep the peace‚Äù and keep my dad happy? Or risk my dad possibly not showing up to my wedding because I don‚Äôt invite her? I already mentioned to my dad I didn‚Äôt want to invite her and he was not happy about it. I think about how I was too complacent sometimes when I was a kid, even attending their wedding as a bridesmaid.. how messed up is that? 

So AITA if I don‚Äôt invite my ex stepmother, who was friends with my mom and had an affair with my dad, to my wedding?"

My second period teacher tried to get people to be quiet because the announcements came on and he was trying to listen but no one shut up and soon after he said ‚Äúwe have announcements now‚Äù and I responded ‚ÄúYay‚Äù and this girl that sat at the table by mine we will call her kacy she yelled at me saying shut up. I was confused and a little mad because I was talking to the teacher and,her response was ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs trying to get us to be quiet‚Äù but the thing was I wasn‚Äôt the only one talking everyone was but I was the only one that got yelled at. her friend (we will call her haylee) took her side and said that she was trying to get me to be quiet like the teacher asked when, the teacher already gave up because the announcement was over. Later on we where heading from the freshman building to the main building for 6th and she yelled at me ‚Äúsidad‚Äù (not sure how to spell it) I didn‚Äôt know what it ment and asked what it ment and she said it ment ‚Äúshut up you f**king b**ch‚Äù I then ignored her. her other friend who we will call jay was with her both times (keep that in mind for later)  she said nothing but she laughed but I just kept ignoreing her. I had to call a number on the vending machine because it scammed me and I was missing 7 dollars after wards I tried another vending machine but it declined my card. My class was out on the track and there‚Äôs this staircase by the vending machine that leads straight out I was planning on going there but once I got down there I decided to put my card in my back pack, then I decided I should go back up to the restroom first so I did that, and when I got up the stairs there comes  kacy and jay walking down  calling my name and kacy saying, ‚Äúsidad‚Äù repeatedly and I ignored her like I had last time,  it wasn‚Äôt the end of them this time. I went in sat my backpack teddy phone and boyfriends hoodie down beside the stall I was going in, once I sat down I hear her calling my name and said ‚Äúsidad‚Äù then it went quiet and I saw someone moving my boyfriends hoodie a bit so I called out ‚Äúwho Evers touching my stuff please stop‚Äù and they didn‚Äôt so, I tried to hurry and come out and by the time I did no one was in there and my backpack and hoodie was moved by the entrance where a mirror was, which was odd cuz my bear and phone remained by the door and I hate enough I was pissed.

He said he‚Äôd handle it so I headed to go outside, as I was heading in I saw Kacy and jay again and they where talking to me like we where friends and nothing had happend jay asked what she did and stuff and I ignored her cause if you can‚Äôt tell your friend to stop bothering me and calling what she she called me you deserve to be ignored just like her. Later on I told my best friend about it like I always do and she was on both sides she understood why I was upset but she also understood why Kacy was upset but my boyfriend had other things to say. After 7th period which was when I told my best friend me and my boyfriend and her went to our normal spot and we sat down and I told him what happens at that point I wasn‚Äôt as mad because my best friend had calmed me down, me and my boyfriend sat down and I told him the story and he said she was harassing me. Iv seen KMK doing videos about redit and thought this would be the perfect place to see other opinions on the story and to just see different points of views since there is a lot of adults on here it would be nice to see what they think on this subject  but let me know if you think I was in the right ESPECIALLY for ignoring jay as well. And sorry if my writing annoys you and the grammar and stuff I was in a rush to get this done-!

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my brother to try to figure out setting up his game console on his own instead of bothering me for everything?,6,2025-04-01 21:39:56,23,"He's 13 got an Xbox 360 recently. Which i'm happy with, but the problem is he keeps bugging me for help setting it up. 

But the problems he's asking for help with are the most basic things, like clicking yes or no on installing an HDD. He needed my help to put in his password that he set himself (it's literally our address number), i told him it twice ""It's 1234"", but he was putting in ""1124"", turns out he was putting in the wrong number all along and i had to get up and do it myself. Then he complained the hard drive wasn't showing up, he didn't even have it in all the way. 

I had just sat down and He complained the game wouldn't start and i had to get up again. In big bold letters, it said ""Copying From Disc"" and to please wait. 

But it's like he doesn't even TRY to figure it out at all. He needs me to do everything. And i don't get it, he's very adept at using a computer and a phone. If it was a serious issue, 

i have to keep geetting up and going in there, which hurts me (I'm a big guy and i have bone problems so getting up and down so much hurts me and it's annoying because it's such petty stuff.) I was in the kitchen and had to keep getting up, the cat nearly got my food because he kept asking me to come do stuff for him. Like i can't sit down for 5 minutes without being bothered about it

I just told him to try to figure it out himself before bothering me for everything. Then i told my mom i dislike when she buys him this stuff because i'm always expected to just do all the work"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I told my mom she can't move in because I'm moving somewhere else?,140,2025-04-01 04:45:49,48,"Now a bit of context before everyone grabs their pitchfork and torches. 

My mom (50+F) had a bunch of medical problems in 2024, she had 4 strokes and lost both of her feet because of her diabetes, I've been her sole caregiver since 2023. 

We got evicted and lived in a RV, that's when my mom lost her feet and had her strokes. I've had to take care of her while juggling a full time job and being a full time student (Working on getting my GED and degree) 

Recently at the start of the year my mom went to a physical rehabilitation center, she constantly blows up my phone and my father's, she's constantly trailing off and sometimes completely dropped the conversation when someone walks into her room, or she asks for things constantly knowing well that I'm struggling to keep things a float, asking for me to buy her vapes or to come see her right then and there even calling me during class and work, I've been working on having her work on her disability and recently I just found out she's been neglecting it so bad they had to reject her and we have to start ALL over again. (Over a year or filing for disability and food stamps, wasted)

I got home from work today and my mom calls me and tells me that she's being kicked out of her rehabilitation center in 3 days because her insurance won't pay for her stay anymore and she needs a place to go and someone to get her, I'm still trying to figure out where me and my dad are going to go because we have to move out of the apartment I'm staying in soon. I want to tell her no she can't stay because she's going to get worse, but I know she'll start crying and it breaks my heart. 

But I'm about to be homeless and I don't even know where I'm going. Plus I feel like I'm going to get mad at her more then happy to see her, she constantly asks for stuff even knowing I'm broke even when we lived in the RV she'd wake me up just to ask if my daily pay hit so I can buy her smokes or soda, not groceries, not snacks, not even booze. Just smokes and soda. I'm just now finally getting into the habit of waiting 2 weeks for my next check instead of using daily pay every time I work.

amitheasshole,AITA for making my friend cry before her race?,2,2025-04-02 03:30:47,6,"I have a friend in my swim team who I am really close with; let's call her Ashley. We both had a 2.5-hour gap between our races, so we were both just chilling on the side, waiting for our races. We were chatting, and I was telling her how I write poetry, and that had been why I only got like 3 hours of sleep last night, and I was rly tired. To my surprise, she also wrote poetry, and she showed me some of hers. It was all really happy, sweet poetry that she wrote. The only problem was that she then asked to see some of mine. The poetry I write is always really dark because I write what I feel in the moment, and I'm kinda depressed rn. The poems that I had on file on my phone were mostly about betrayal, broken trust, and even su1c1d3. I had some cute love ones sprinkled in there, but not many. anyways, i had gotten to pick from the titles which of her poems i wanted to read, she she said she should do the same. i agreed, forgetting for a moment how dark my writing was, and gave her my phone. she just happened to pick a super dark one, telling the story who got betrayed by the one person who she still cared for, then commits su1c1d3. i left for a moment while she was reading to get a drink, and when i came back, she was full on bawling her eyes out. I tried to comfort her but she was full on crying. after a while she calmed down, i showed her some of my love poems bcz they were nicer and she was happy again. about a minute later, we looked up at the board with the races on it, HER NAME WAS ON THE BOARD, she had about 30 seconds before her race started, and all of her competitors were already up. she sprinted toward the dive block and jumped on without even checking in, and set off just on time for the race, but because she was crying from my poem, she almost missed her race, she didn't get to warm up, and i had to sign in for her aafter the race had ended so she wouldn't be disqualified. she did worse than she could've in that race, and we both blame me. AITA for making her cry?"
amitheasshole,AITA: I skip a lot of events for close friends on Sundays because I refuse to do anything.,0,2025-04-02 15:40:49,81,"This isn‚Äôt tied to a specific event but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wondered about for a very long time. I have a bit of a Sunday tradition with my father (who‚Äôs 83 now but in good health), where we watch sports all day on Sundays (NFL in the winter, and Golf during spring and summer). It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve done for years and I‚Äôve missed it only a handful of times. Important point:

My close friends and family know this already, so it isn‚Äôt a surprise but it still causes issues At times. In addition to this (This question is a bit 2 pronged), I am a huge sports fanatic. I will refuse to miss certain sporting events (Masters For example), again people know this as I am up front about it, but it still creates issues. 

A good specific example is a big one. It was about 3 years ago it was my good friend‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs birthday. He had a party on Master‚Äôs Sunday. I didn‚Äôt go to the party. I still get shit for it over 3 years later. I‚Äôve had issues with SOs in the past about this as well, as during certain events I refuse to compromise. I feel that because I am up front about this stuff, and let it be known during certain events and Sundays I will not be doing anything, I‚Äôm not in the wrong. But am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for Taking Credit for a Team Project When I Did Most of the Work?,6,2025-04-01 20:03:50,18,"So, I (27F) work on a team at my job where we were tasked with putting together a big presentation. The thing is, most of the work fell on me‚ÄîI did the majority of the research, created the slides, and even came up with the main points. But, when it came time to present, I didn‚Äôt give my teammates as much credit as I should have.

I‚Äôve been working really hard lately, and I wanted this to be a moment where I could show my boss what I‚Äôm capable of. So, during the presentation, I kind of glossed over the fact that others contributed and made it seem like I was the driving force behind the whole thing.

Some of my teammates are annoyed with me for not giving them proper credit, but I feel like I put in way more effort than they did. I‚Äôm proud of the work I did, and I don‚Äôt think I should have to downplay my role just to make everyone else feel better.

So, AITA for taking credit for a team project when I did most of the work?

**TL;DR**: Did most of the work for a team project and didn‚Äôt give credit to my teammates during the presentation. Now they‚Äôre mad, but I feel like I earned the recognition."
amitheasshole,WIBTA for investigating my mom?,4,2025-04-02 00:15:47,25,"I (28m) and my mom (56f) have had a pretty decent relationship until a month ago ago. I'd been looking through my old things (2 months ago) as she had decided to move out of our old family home (it's decently big and she lives alone, she couldn't maintain it to well). There was this mint-green beanie baby rabbit, and then I remembered how I was good friends with a girl when I was around 8.   
  
TLDR: We went to their house, and when we went back the house apparently hadn't been lived-in for a few years. Keep in mind I was a kid and didn't question anything that my mom said. 

In any case, around 2 months ago I asked her about this. She became very defensive and straight-up told me that these people had never existed. I'd understand if I was a kid and maybe misremembered or had an imaginary friend, however I still had the bunny (which I'd taken from the girl's home). Along with the fact that she was not normally acting like this - she usually tries to put everything onto herself! 

I knew that this was definitely weird, so I asked a few friends and they all agreed that I should go show her the rabbit. When I did so, she flew into a rage and cursed me out. She NEVER curses. She said that I was being manipulative and ""how could you try and do this to your own mother"" and things along that line. She kicked me out that day and barely talked to me for the rest of the moving process, and she isn't answering my calls or texts. She leaves me on read, which is highly unlike herself. 

Would I be the asshole for trying to look into this further? Would there still be stuff from 2005 that I could use to help find out what the hell is going on?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I asked my friend's father to reimburse me?,0,2025-04-02 14:57:26,87,"Basically, like two months ago, I (19F) went at a party with very high heels, leather boots. They're my favorite. My friend that we'll call Daniel (18M) always go to parties with a backpack. We went together and left together. We had to walk so he lended me a pair of comfortable shoes, which I was very grateful for, and he put my boots in his bag. We went home and life goes on. 

Except that two days ago, Daniel casually mentioned his father thought he was transgender or a drag queen, and threw the boots away. He's not exactly sure he did it, his father might have hidden them, but they're not in his room anymore. Daniel was laughing when he was telling me this, but I wasn't at all. I don't like his father, he doesn't like me because I'm bisexual and have scars on my arm. It's very in character for him to throw away the boots if he thought they were Daniel's, which is such a shitty thing to do, but the fact they're mine angered me even more. 

I have fond memories with those boots, I went to multiple big concerts with it like Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter, I've bought some clothes according to those boots. So I told Daniel I'd have to ask his father to reimburse me if he threw them away. Daniel said it probably wouldn't go well but understands my pov. 

So WIBTA? I might be wrong since I let the boots there, but still. 

Edit: I feel like I've left out a couple of things. Daniel is one of my closest friends and I currently have at least four of his belongings in my bedroom. I thought I could leave my boots in his bedroom and they'd be safe, because I've been keeping his own belongings safe and retrieving them when he needs them. I asked him two weeks later if the boots were still in his bedroom and we joked about it. While I know his father's an ass, I would have never imagined that he would throw away anything he saw in his son's room. However, I do agree that two months is a long time. It's just that I haven't needed them. They're very high heels, 12cm, so while I love wearing them, I don't have many occasions to. I went through two moves the past two months and got a new job. And yes, I know his father is probably gonna say no. That's mainly why I think I might be the asshole if I do this, but at the same time, I don't want to let him get away with it. "
amitheasshole,AITA for Yelling at my Mother?,8,2025-04-01 19:44:19,40,"I am a kid born in the US, but my parents are from India. My mom, lets call her ""Atchu"" is currently studying in GED. I am a 15 year old (turning 16 in November) and currently endure all her yelling and screaming she does at home. We have 2 laptops at home, my school chromebook and my gaming laptop. I usually use the gaming laptop since its a larger laptop and Windows, which I am very comfortable with. And the chromebook is a slow device and the school blocks some websites necessary for me to do the assignment. Heck, even our teachers recommend us to use our personal devices for some of their assignments. But every time I use it and my dad is not home, she starts yelling at me and saying she needs to use it for her GED studies. Sure, OK, fine with me. But when I finally give it to her while she is doing all that yelling, she DOESN'T EVEN USE IT. She just scrolls on her phone on either YouTube or FaceBook. Today, I finally broke. As soon as my dad left for a doctor appointment, and I was using the gaming laptop (for school) she starts yelling and telling me to give it to her. I tell her I need 30 minutes only (compared to her 2-3 hours). She then starts saying she will message and call my dad saying I gave her the laptop when I saw my dad in the driveway. I decided to just give her the laptop only 10-15 minutes in, because I couldn't bear her yelling. I put the laptop in front of her, and SHE AGAIN DIDN'T USE IT. She was on her phone SCROLLING on FaceBook. I cracked and yelled at her saying why she tormented me for about 15 minutes for the laptop, only to not use it. She yelled back at me saying she will complain to my dad about my ""unacceptable behavior."" So I messaged my dad about everything she just said, what she did, and left to the library, which is a 5 minute walk from my house. I am currently typing this in the library. So again, AITA for yelling at my mother, because its Indian culture (and pretty sure for the rest of the world too) to not even QUESTION what our parents say. I think by yelling at her I broke a pretty big rule and I'm sure I will be punished in hell for this (that is what Indians say)."
amitheasshole,AITA for not showing affection,0,2025-04-02 12:44:34,28,"Me (17F) and my friend Mark have been best friends for 5 years, give or take.  About a half a year ago he confessed to me that he might have romantic feelings towards me, I told him I don‚Äôt feel the same but I do think his feelings are valid, unfortunately it‚Äôs not mutual. 

We remained friends. He started being really clingy. He gets really close sometimes and gets touchy (It was never inappropriate!). I do show discomfort but never tell him directly in the moment, cuz im kind of scared and don‚Äôt want to cause trouble, especially since it‚Äôs in public. 

Recently he started texting me, he feels really sad and unloved and that he needs me to show affection, give all my attention and keep talking to him. I keep telling him that I‚Äôm not comfortable with physical touch* nor talking all the time. Big part of my mental issues is my social battery constantly being drained ‚Äî I‚Äôm working on fixing that but it‚Äôs really difficult. He keeps telling me that all he cares about is me and my happiness, but it feels like he needs a whole different person than me. 

For example today: We were in the bus and he told me to lay my head on his shoulder - I told him no and he got really sad or mad. The night prior we talked about our issues and he asked if the next day on the bus I could lay my head on him. I said yes because I was scared to decline, so it doesn‚Äôt make him sad again. I didn‚Äôt keep my promise so that is my fault. But it‚Äôs the same with everything else, where he‚Äôs forcing me to do something I‚Äôm not comfortable with doing and then tells me I don‚Äôt care about him. Which is not true I do care about him, but he keeps disrespecting my boundaries, instead of letting me be me. 

I‚Äôve been struggling mentally for so long and recently I started prioritising my mental health and I do feel happier. Finally, I‚Äôm not feeling uncomfortable all the time at school and feel like I can communicate with people. But the constant pressure from Mark is setting me back a lot, it feels like I haven‚Äôt gotten better at all and still the most asocial person in the world. 

I feel like he loves the idea of me and not me. 

So AITA for not returning affection?


*A reason for that is that maybe I‚Äôm only comfortable doing that in a romantic context or just not with someone that I know has feelings for me and it isn‚Äôt 
mutual. I honestly think it‚Äôs both reasons combined.

 i 28NB autistic and she 27F. we are going together to a city so far away,in other places could be another country itself:  
The main point is a concert, i was thinking about the prices so i bought everything with anticipation. i was buying the plane tickets and then i thought she might want to go together so i told her and she said sure, but i guess she meant sure as in buy both tickets, i just bought mine. She asked how much it was so that she could pay me. i was confused but then i got it, i told her it was only my ticket i bought, and that's when she got angry.  
she said i don't consider her at all in anything, and that the trip is about us¬® not about me.   
so we should've bought everything together but i did it because it was cheaper and just logistically better with anticipation, I did it two months before the concert and she asked to pay about a week before the concert. ??

she said i was being too selfish and that she would have to reconsider going. (we already have the concert tickets) i asked her to tell me so that i could cancel and maybe get my money back because the whole trip was about us going for me too, but i just didn't think that getting there together was necessary. she isn't talking to me rn but i just don't get why that was a big deal.   
i told her about it before buying them, i tried to tell her every detail about it the plane the hour the code, i was thinking maybe she could buy the same one if she wanted to go together but i guess she didn't check what i sended so here we are.  
we are days from the concert so reddit am i the asshole? \*also if i am consider the asshole please explain because i already apologized but i still don't understand what i did wrong. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not really liking my friends (also my roommates) anymore?,4,2025-04-01 22:30:01,5," I (F 20) live with 4 other people in a college house. I met 3 of them freshman year and one through a friend and we decided to live together which at the time sounded so fun. I was extremely close to two of my roommates let‚Äôs call them Andy (M 20) and Leah (F 20) since freshman year. By close I mean I lived with Andy the summer inbetween our 2nd  and 3rd year of college and me and brylee were joined at the hip since we got close freshman year. Everything was going great after we moved into our house at the beginning of our 3rd year until October. On Halloween night Andy, Leah and one of our other roommates left me behind at a bar at closing time (2:00am) and didn‚Äôt respond to any of my calls or text or event text me to see where I had gone. It was busy so we had gotten separated leaving the bar but since they were responding to anything I decided to make the 20 minute walk home alone because I couldn‚Äôt afford a Lyft home on my own (I live in the capital of my state so during holidays Lyft prices are insane). It was scary walking home alone and I was upset with them but I didn‚Äôt actually get angry until I receive a text saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on a separate journey‚Äù from Leah. I don‚Äôt know why but this pissed me off so bad. After that I proceeded to give them the silent treatment (I know childish) because I thought they knew what they did wrong cause I literally told them they left me. After about a week of the silent treatment I went to a different country for a project team competition and then the following week I went to a different state for a conference. So I had not talk to them for about a month after the initial incident. Once I got back they blew up at me calling me childish and out of my name. I understood why they‚Äôre were upset but I still had not received and apology for being left alone as a women in the capital of our state at 2:00am. Honestly I had gotten over it by that point and wasn‚Äôt not talking to them because I had a trip and responsibilities to take care of. Plus I have lupus which can be triggered by stress so I chose to ignore the problem so I didn‚Äôt flare up (which is why I understood why they were angry). We kinda made up but I only got an apology from Leah and a half assed apology from Andy where he still acted like me giving them the silent treatment was comparable to putting my life in danger. Ever since then I feel disconnected from them and they seemed to bond over the experience. I notice it in little ways like the way they interact with one another vs me or who they will ask to hangout/study with. I honestly don‚Äôt really like them anymore but I have no choices since we are roommates and we already signed our lease for next year . I know I didn‚Äôt approach the situation the best way but I kinda just don‚Äôt ain‚Äôt to keep telling like an outsider with them anymore and that feeling just keeps growing. AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for planning to keep money from my share of my parents apartment.,3963,2025-03-31 07:10:04,545,"Hi - that is a burner account, for obvious reasons.

I try to keep it short.  
Backstory -  
I (24f) had a pretty crappy childhood, even tho I was never hungry, I was the unwanted child wearing second-hand clothes, and everything I owned was hand-me-downs.

My last memory of my father was when I was around 6 or 7, my parents were screaming at each other and that was the last time I saw my father.  
My mother already had a new partner, and not long after giving birth to the long-awaited son - he got everything: name-brand clothes, new phones and even if my parents wanted to say no, he cried and still got what he wanted.  
Today, I live in a rental apartment in Tallinn (Estonia) and my mother sometimes calls me, I sometimes visit if I want to see my friends still in my home town.

Quite recently my brother (17) told me that our mother and his father bought a house, they are going to sell the apartment and even tho most of the money from selling the place will go to renovating the house, they will buy him a car (BMW!!!) for 18th birthday!  
I pretended that I was happy for him, not his fault he was spoiled. (It hurt me, I never got even a new bicycle)

A few weeks later my mother called me and told me she was sad to inform me that my father had passed away quite some time ago - she wanted to contact him about selling the apartment and found out that he is no longer with us, his sister will send the death certificate from Finland - his home country he went back. (No wonder I never found anything about him)

My mother found a buyer for the apartment and when she sent the death certificate to the notary they informed her that there was a will made by him leaving everything he owned in Estonia to me! (They did not inform me before, as they had no information about death.)  
Suddenly I owned 50% of my parent's apartment, as they got it together way before I was born.

Mother explained to me, that I should gift my share to her, as he paid no child support and she raised me alone! (Which is not even true, my step-father was there my whole life)

I told her, that I might use my share as a downpayment for my own home in Tallinn.

Suddenly both my brother and mother are mad at me.  
When I pointed out that my brother bragged about a car my mother explained to me how I am an adult now living my own life, and I should not expect my parent's support at the age of 24! When she was my age she was completely independent.  
Taking 50% would mean they can't even finish all the renovations they started in the house.

My brother keeps sending me messages that I am selfish and don't care that it was his home too.

They are really mad at me.  
I am not asking for advice, I will take my 50%, I am asking if that makes me an A.

AITA?

Edit: Update  
When I arrived to home there was a message from the notary that the handwritten will (Will as attachment) my mother sent him is not legal anymore, as those have to renewed every 6 months.  
Long story short - it does sound like my father scammed my mother to avoid child support and give the apartment to me!  
Turns out he made handwritten will in 2006 that he will leave the whole apartment he bought while marriage to my mother and it should cover child support.  
Few months later he made a will in notary that he will leave his part of apartment to me (In marriage it is automatically 50-50).  
Turns out that anyone can make a new will any time they want.  
I still don't change my mind... so AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friend about what her ‚Äúcrush‚Äù said?,4,2025-04-01 19:45:46,14,"I‚Äôm 17F, and my friend Jackie (17F) is talking to Ryan (16M). Our other friend Julie (17F) and I don‚Äôt have real issues with Ryan‚Äîhe just doesn‚Äôt talk to us much‚Äîbut he does treat Jackie poorly sometimes.

One day, my best friend (who I didn‚Äôt know was friends with Ryan) mentioned that he had been talking badly about Julie. Even our teacher, who overheard, confirmed it. I told Julie but didn‚Äôt mention it to Jackie at the time.

Later, my best friend told me Ryan had also been talking badly about me, Julie, and Jackie. I was pissed because I had no issue with him, and the things he said were disgusting. On top of that, he has openly expressed that he doesn‚Äôt like African American women (despite being Black himself), so you can imagine how bad it was. I planned to confront him, but he wasn‚Äôt there.

I texted Jackie, telling her I was going to curse him out. She responded, ‚ÄúTell me what happens.‚Äù (Remember that.) I didn‚Äôt tell her exactly why, though.

When I finally saw him, I went off. While I was confronting him, four people came up and told me even worse things he had said‚Äîhow he doesn‚Äôt want to commit to Jackie, how she asks for too much, how Julie is annoying, how I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe Black bitch,‚Äù and that Jackie is just an acquaintance to him. He also said Julie stinks and a bunch of other nonsense.

I texted Jackie everything, but she kept saying, ‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs denying it.‚Äù But four people had no reason to lie, and what made it even weirder was that Ryan suddenly stopped talking to all of them, even though they were his only friends. He doesn‚Äôt even know they told me. My best friend even offered to record him for proof.

Jackie still kept talking to him, which is her choice, but after that, she started avoiding me. In class, she wouldn‚Äôt talk to me, and in the halls, she and Julie would chat while I just walked away.

We hung out over the weekend at an event, but I wasn‚Äôt really engaging with her. Then today, Ryan walked by, and Jackie pulled me aside like I was about to go off again. She told me she was upset about what I did, even though she originally told me to update her. Now she‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her relationship,‚Äù but what does that have to do with him insulting all of us?

Hi, first off I would like to say that I'm only asking for insight and I don't want to hear anything negative about my family. This is because of past experiences with reddit. 

Disclaimer these are all fake names for the people in this post.

Okay, me (15f) and my mom(42f) basically only had eachother for my entire life. Except for my grandparents and uncles. But, I've never really had my dad in my life. My father figures were my Grampa and Papa(step grandad).

Anyway. My mom has been dating her boyfriend John (42 m) for about three years. John and her were highschool sweethearts but broke up when she left for college in her sophomore year. 

I like John, he is a pretty good guy and he always takes into account my feelings and how I feel about things. Just so you guys know that he doesn't hurt us in anyway.

John has two daughters P(13) and O(10). They are both good kids and we get along okay ish. The only downside is that they always want to annoy me. I'll be talking about something I don't like that a kid said at school. And then the next day they will use it against me. Anyway that's beside the point that's just a little bit of background information.

Anyway, my mom sat me down last night and asked me if I was okay with her and John getting married. If he proposes. I said I was okay with it, but I was worried about how the girls felt. She told me they weren't asked that question, but when the time was right they will ask them. I said okay, that's fine.

The next question that she asked me was if I was okay with John adopting me/ me calling him my step dad. I said I wasn't comfortable with that due to past experiences.

A little background information. My mom was in a mentally abusive relationship with a guy we'll call Little Fucker. They were together for six years and honestly those six years were hell. He did things that weren't okay like throwing things and saying we were all worthless. Please do not worry he is in prison now because of tax fraud. Anyway my dad was in the military and during covid he passed away do to some health problems. This was really hard on me even though I didn't know him that well. Little Fucker used this to mentally manipulate me and made me feel worthless. 

One day he told me he wanted to adopt me and we both cried. A few minutes later he started yelling and screaming at me about not washing a cast iron. The only eeason I didn't wash the cast iron was because he TOLD ME NOT TO. He then started saying things like ""you never deserved a father"".

This incident was why I told my mom I didn't feel comfortable with John doing that. She then got upset and started saying things like ""but he cares so much about you"" and ""all that stuff is in the past"". I got upset and told her I care about him too but I still have the right to not want to get adopted. She then called me a brat and left.

I don't know if I'm the asshole or not. So AITA that I told my mom I didn't want to call her boyfriend my Step-dad if they got married?"
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to sleep on the floor in our Airbnb?,3761,2025-03-31 06:09:20,358,"I (21M) am going on a trip with two friends: a guy (19M) and a girl (19F). We all get along well, and we found a nice, cheap Airbnb in a quiet area.

The Airbnb has one single sofa bed and one double bed. After we booked it, the girl suddenly suggested that we rotate who sleeps on the sofa bed and the double bed, which seemed fair to me at first.

But then she said she won‚Äôt share the double bed with another guy because of a past experience that affected her. I told her I understood, but that means my friend and I would have to take turns sleeping on the floor since there are only two sleeping spots. I suggested she stay on the sofa bed instead, but she refused, saying she has back problems.

Now it feels like she expects my friend and me to alternate between the sofa and the floor while she always gets the double bed. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair, but she insists on her arrangement.

AITA for refusing to sleep on the floor?

amitheasshole,AITA for asking to work 4 days instead of 5,1,2025-04-01 22:39:43,31,"My family moved town recently and the way we have our week setup is our child is in daycare 3 days a week and those are the days my partner works, she makes more per hour than me but finds the idea of working more than 3 days exhausting and we also dont want our child in daycare more than he has to be. So 2 days of the week she is with them by herself until I finish work. Lately she has been asking and making comments that she thinks our child wants 1-on-1 time with just me, because our weekends are spent as a family, yes sometimes I take them out to the shops or for a swim/park but its not a whole day thing. 

I both want to do this because I love spending time with our kid but also feel like it eats into our limited family time. And i also partly feel she is saying this because she wants a day to herself each week too, which is understandable, but because her 1-on-1 days are while im at work, i will never have the same opportunity to have a break day.

I suggested I drop to 4 days a week, and she increases to 4 days that way we each have a day with our kid separately and also family weekends together. Our financial situation would also be better because she earns more per hour. She got upset saying I already know how exhausting it is for her to do 3 days, so 4 would be too much. But i feel like her days off are exhausting any way because she looks after a 3 year old by herself...

So AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for Canceling my Mothers wanted plans for MY birthday?,773,2025-03-31 13:39:19,196,"I (20F) am turning 21 this May. My relationship with my mother has always been strained because she tends to dismiss my feelings and manipulate me. In January, she asked me to visit her in Vegas for her birthday, but I didn't want to go since I was forced to be there for five years before I turned 18. I have a habit of telling her what she wants to hear to avoid conflict, so I initially agreed, even though I didn‚Äôt want to go. Later, I realized I couldn‚Äôt afford the trip, so I told her I‚Äôd visit for my birthday instead.

A few days ago, I told her I changed my mind and wanted to go to Universal Studios with her and the family instead. I offered to pay for her flight and anything else she needed, but she called me selfish and got upset. She has been pressuring me to visit Vegas for years, and I‚Äôve always given in. This time, I stood up for myself, which led to her texting me:

‚ÄúIdk who told you it was ok to be disrespectful... You do whatever you want for your birthday, I don't care. I'm done.‚Äù

I responded (while at work), explaining my decision to change plans and how I felt hurt by her calling me selfish when I was trying to compromise. She responded by saying she wouldn‚Äôt communicate via text, calling me disrespectful and accusing me of treating her poorly.

She later complained to my aunt and hung up on her when my aunt didn‚Äôt agree with her. I‚Äôve been thinking about it and wondering if I was wrong for changing my mind.

AITA for canceling plans she wanted for my own birthday, especially when this is the first time I‚Äôm doing what I want?

He has been diagnosed with a number of mental issues, including ones under the schizophrenic and bipolar umbrellas. In the four months we‚Äôve been ‚Äúdating‚Äù (it‚Äôs a platonic relationship, this is relevant), he, his therapist, and his mom have all seen and agreed that I am an amazing person for him to be dating and be around. I‚Äôve shown that I am able and willing to comfort him, be with him, and help calm him down when he has an episode. 

This information, along with directions from his therapist on how to handle him if an episode happens, was emailed to our teacher/trip coordinator by his mom yesterday afternoon. Until this point, he and I had been rooming together. It was sent out in the email and everything. After his mom‚Äôs email was sent, our teacher said we had to redo the rooms and split us up.

I asked her why, and she said it was because we couldn‚Äôt be dating and share a room (she knew we were dating, she asked me and I told we were and ‚Äúthere will be no fucking around‚Äù and that was good enough for her). She said she was sorry, but administration said she has to split up any romantic relationships. I told her it wasn‚Äôt romantic, and she said it was a matter of how it presented, and there‚Äôs nothing she can do.

Beyond just ‚ÄúI want to cuddle with my boyfriend,‚Äù this is an actual safety concern for him. He‚Äôs worst at night, which is when we need to be in our own rooms. Our rooms are being taped, and if we leave our rooms after curfew everyone gets punished. His devices lock at 9:30, so we can‚Äôt even text if something happens. On top of that, the people he was made to room with are the two he most the most uncomfortable around, to the point he was debating not going.

My biggest concern with this is his safety, but he asked me not to say anything to our teacher. He sent an email asking if he and I could trade rooms and hasn‚Äôt gotten a response yet.

I want to say something or do something, and because it is technically a medical/safety concern I think something might be able to be changed, but I don‚Äôt want to push it or make him upset.

He and his girlfriend announced that they are expecting a baby. My mom is happy that her youngest is about to be a father, but I'm really not all that happy for them. 

Andre is on the spectrum and has difficulties maintaining a stable life. He can't hold down a job more than a few months at a time. He can't keep an apartment because of this work ethic and had to move back in with dad several times. Constantly asks for money. How can he be expected to take care of a baby?

Andre really has no family close to help him out except for dad (mom and our other siblings live in another state, I live 8 hours away across the state).

My brother says I'm an asshole for not being more optimistic about his new family. Can anyone blame me? Am I the asshole?

amitheasshole,WIBTA for hiding things from my own mother.,2,2025-04-01 21:19:41,10,"So, I'll ofc give background, as I normally do.

So this started today at around 2:00 east time. Me and my mother were going to pick up my little sister from school. So we talked for a bit about how things were going outside and how I wanted to kind set up my room to be a ""studio"". Essentially, I wanted to save money to buy a mini fridge and other small items for utilities and have my own setup for working, gaming, studying, etc. so this sparks up a whole nother lecture from my mom about how my rooms a mess and I need to clean and how she went into my room while I was away and took pictures of my room. She pulls up these pictures after I told her I will be cleaning today and shoved the phone in my face.

This sparks a reaction out of me because one, this is my mother. She should not be acting like a child showing his/her parent a drawing. Two, she's being absolutely persistent and hyperfixating on my room being dirty. I told her ""okay I get it it's like I'm in my god damn room, every fucking day"". She leaves me alone after that.

Come time we pick her up and we're almost home. She starts ranting more about my room saying it needs to be as clean as if she cleaned it. So while I was cleaning, I found $10 that was missing. I go and show her my find and continue on.

Come some MORE time later and I'm attempting to leave the house to take a break as I've been working on cleaning my room from 3:00- as of typing this. She demands I only buy a drink and nothing more. She tells me that the $10 I found will not be leaving the house then says ""matter of fact, give it to me"". I tell her ""no, I have a spot I Save it"". It becomes an argument about her taking my money as she has in the past. 


(For a Little extra context as to why I said no. Every time I go out and try to do some work for some old folk I'll go buy a polar pop and some cookies at the corner store (costs exactly $4.15) this is like once a week. She has been taking the money that I make ($20-$100) to ""save"" it. I have never seen my money since). 

AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for not giving my crush my best friend snap,2,2025-04-01 18:57:32,8,"**AITA for not giving my best friend‚Äôs crush my best friend‚Äôs snap?**

So, I (high school student) had a crush on this guy‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Santos. We would always make eye contact in the hallways, and eventually, I started liking him. My best friend (let‚Äôs call her Emily) had a crush on his friend, so whenever we saw them, we‚Äôd giggle and smile at them like typical high school girls.

One day, Emily suggested we follow them on Instagram. I followed Santos, and he immediately started texting me‚Äîjust simple ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúhey‚Äù messages. I was super nervous, so I didn‚Äôt reply right away. Eventually, we started talking, but the issue is that Emily had access to my account (I trusted her completely). Long story short, she ended up talking to him **the whole night**, and he was being extra cheesy, telling me (her) to bring a hoodie in the morning because it would be ""cold"" (it was literally hot that day).

She ended up arranging a date with him for me, but when I showed up, he **never came.** The next day, another guy randomly started talking to me, but I was dry because I was upset. Then out of nowhere, he started **insulting me and body-shaming me**, saying Santos never actually liked me and only started talking to me because he thought I was ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù

Turns out, **that ""other guy"" was actually Santos using a different account.** Emily was reading all of this because she still had my account. Then, *Santos* (on his fake account) asked for **Emily‚Äôs Snapchat**, and I told him **no**. Now Emily is upset and thinks I should have given it to him.

amitheasshole,AITA for trying to restart or try again a relationship with my stepmom?,0,2025-04-02 00:49:43,10,"Advice?

Context: I am a 17F turning 18 in the fall, and I have two half siblings, one bio sibling, and a step mom (42) and dad (46). When I was roughly four my bio mom passed away suddenly to disease, and dad, rather suddenly, got engaged and married six months after her passing. Stepmom came in, completely changed the house, amd rules (understandably, I was a little shit back then). Ensue this constant battle between me and her (Dad was severely disengaged and still grieving), and then she had a kid a little less than a year after they married, and then had another one four years later. 

As I grew up, I was severely sheltered and what felt like severe criticism I guess? (i.e. You can't make it anywhere, you're hopeless, no one cares, crybaby, I'll take you to the orphanage/ foster home). In middle school, I started to feel severely depressed and anxious and eventually I told her that I was having thoughts of well, things. She then proceeded to get pissed off, and left the room. So, I decided not to trust her with mental health matters. Now I am 17 1/2, and she has graduated with a behavioral health degree, and she says she knows what's best for me.

I at this point, am planning to high tail it outta there as soon as I turn 18 so I can have some peace, since my half siblings (her kids) are chaotic and loud as hell. She is angry (or frustrated, I can never tell, shes very loud) at me all the time, and has always said that she doesn't have to be my mom (I never asked her to), and she said recently that she thought she could save me and my sister from a mom less life, and she thought it would be easy since me and my sister were little. 

I have told her numerous times that maybe I would like to reestablish and just try to step back from each other, but she is very much making it a ride or die, mother and daughter relationship only. I however don't want that, and I don't think me and her should shove ourselves in that box right now. What in the ever living hell should I do? Is this situation toxic? "
amitheasshole,AITA for spending money saved for an engagement ring on a tattoo.,6653,2025-03-31 01:15:04,1048,"A bit more than a month ago my now ex broke up with me out of the blue. I don‚Äôt want to go into the details of the relationship or the break up but we had been talking about marriage before the break up. We had settled on the wedding bands and an engagement ring. I am by no means well off and arguably live paycheck to paycheck but I manage to always pay my bills, save money, and budget money for fun (concerts, fancy dinners, trips to ren Fairs/ cons/ rallies, random events, etc). While still doing all this I managed to put aside several thousand for the engagement ring she wanted. After the break up I decided to spend that money on myself. I bought myself my favorite bourbon, a case of my favorite cigars, and finally finish a large tattoo sleeve I‚Äôve been having worked on for two years. The issue came when I started casually seeing a young woman, let‚Äôs call her Dee. I knew Dee before I met my ex but we were more acquaintances than anything else just due to life stuff (and honestly because I only had eyes for my now ex from the moment i first met her) but we knew enough about each other that she was familiar with the fact that I‚Äôm not one to just casually throw money around. Since this money wasn‚Äôt budgeted for anything (well not since the breakup) and let‚Äôs be honest I‚Äôm heartbroken I‚Äôve been a lot more willing to just say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and spend money. Tonight I met Dee for dinner and drinks and during the drinks part of the evening she noticed my fresh ink and jokingly asked me if I had gotten promoted or hit the lottery. When I explained to her where this money had come from she got real serious and told me that spending it like that was disrespectful. That I had saved that money for something beautiful and by ‚Äúwasting it‚Äù it proves I never cared about my ex. Dee ended up leaving me at the bar (where I am currently typing this up) because she was upset with me. Maybe it‚Äôs the fantastic cocktails blurring my judgement but am I the asshole for spending my money?"
amitheasshole,AITA for accidentally cutting off my friend while driving?,0,2025-04-02 00:12:56,2,"I'll try to make this as succinct as possible since it requires a little background:

Me (32/F) and my bf at the time (31/M) became fast friends with his coworker and spouse after meeting at their x-mas party. So close that they had us witness their courthouse wedding, we helped them move into their new home, did mundane things together, shared stuff, made a bday party for them at our house, I took them to my annual family camping trip...you get the vibe. (Besties!)

One weekend we met up to check out a few estate sales. Jamie (28/F) and Josh (22/M) were in separate vehicles (he had just bought a motorcycle) & me and my bf in my car. On our way to the 2nd sale, we followed one another in our cars and I accidentally found myself in a turn lane that I did not realize was there. To put it shortly, I had to make a quick decision and I accidentally cut Josh off in my car to go straight instead of turn. I immediately realized my mistake and apologized. (I didn't come close to hitting him, it was just kinda a shitty last second decision I made because I was in the middle of the intersection already). Jamie gives me a reprimand for doing this, Josh is chill about it. I apologize to him, but vibes with Jamie felt off. I end up going home crying because I felt really terrible and off.

I text with Jamie all night- she's patronizing me and telling me I could have seriously hurt Josh. I apologize many times and i think that all has been settled. She texts me a few days later that we can no longer be friends and I never heard from them again.

This was a yr & a half ago now and I still think about them all the time. 

AITA for this one mistake????? Do I deserve to lose lifelong friends because of this? ugh

I am very close with my mom and stepdad and we have a great relationship. I have my own home with my bf (24) and we both work full time at our jobs with 2 dogs. Both mine and my bf's job allows us a 3 day weekend every week. We only work Mon.-Thurs. My moms babysitter is not reliable and they plan on switching but cannot switch until after the summer is over . It just so happens almost every time the babysitter cancels for the day, it tends to be on a Friday and I usually will tell my mom I can watch my little sister on my day off, though I don't love it. I love my little sister but watching a one year old can be exhausting. Especially while tending dogs. Well this week, my little sister caught RSV and my parents need help with babysitting. Monday, I watched her for 7 hours on my unpaid vacation day from work, I have the whole week off it's just all unpaid. That day, I was originally told I only had to watch my sister for 4 hours. That clearly didn't happen. Next week, I already said I would watch her again on Friday. Well after I had watched my little sister that Monday, they also need me for Tuesday, again on my unpaid vacation day. This time I said no. It's not that I don't want to help them, I do. But my bf took off on Monday for us to hang out and I wasn't home all day due to watching the baby. Now Tuesday? I feel taken advantage of as an older sister. I didn't sign up to watch my sister all the time when they announced they were pregnant. Sometimes when I say no, my mom guilt trips me and make me feel like I am selfish and don't want to be around my sister but that's not the case. My life is exhausting and I need a break.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friend that his other friend is gasping behind his back?,1,2025-04-01 23:51:11,13,"(Gossiping, not gasping) Last semester, I was in a friend group with Jack and Philip. We used to have long calls together and were close. I also had another friend, Michael. We had drama last summer but forgave each other and became good friends again. My other friend, Louis, changed schools two semesters ago. He‚Äôs still close with Philip, but after everything that happened, I don‚Äôt know how to feel about either of them.

Jack hated Mike but acted like his friend while constantly gossiping about him. This started after Mike and another group planned an outing, invited Jack, but then canceled and rescheduled without re-inviting him. Jack never let it go.

One time, I added Louis to a call since he‚Äôs close with Philip and me. Louis commented on Jack‚Äôs voice changing, and Jack got super defensive. They argued, and since then, Louis has disliked Jack.

Fast forward‚Äîa substitute teacher came in, and our friend group (Philip and Mike are not included bc they were in another class) sat together playing Truth or Dare. Someone asked Jack if he cared about Philip, and Jack admitted he doesn‚Äôt really pay attention to Philip‚Äôs talks and only kind of cares about him.

That stuck with me. Later, I told Louis about Jack‚Äôs gossiping. Louis suggested I confront Jack, but I was over the friendship, so instead, I told Mike everything. Mike said he had been getting weird vibes from Jack and suspected he was still mad about the canceled outing. I also mentioned that Philip knew Jack had been talking badly about him because he was in the call when it happened. Mike decided to unfriend Jack and told Philip he should too.

The next day, I skipped school, worried about how things would go out. After school, Mike texted me, saying Jack denied half of what I told him but admitted to some. Jack also said snitching is a sin (even though gossiping is too). I told Mike I swear Jack said those things.

Then, I got a group call from Jack and Philip. Turns out Philip didn‚Äôt back me up‚Äîhe just stayed silent. Jack called me a liar and said no one wanted to talk to me anymore, so I was being kicked out. I told him Mike deserved to know.

After the call, I texted Philip, reminding him that he was there when Jack gossiped about Mike. Philip told me I should apologize because I did something ‚Äúvery wrong.‚Äù Eventually, Mike unfriended me, I barely talk to Philip, and I was fully kicked out of the group.

Months later, the group turned against Mike too. I don‚Äôt know exactly why, because the only information I got is from Louis, and it‚Äôs not a lot. Now, Louis wants to go out with Philip and Jack and offered to tell Jack that I‚Äôm sorry and regret what happened. I told him no. Why would I want to reconnect with someone who bullies me every day because of what happened?

Louis insists it will work out and even said he had a vision that I‚Äôd thank him bc I‚Äôm ‚Äúso alone right now.‚Äù Honestly, I‚Äôm so sick of friendships at this point. Am I the asshole?   (Again Sorry for the gasping and gossiping typo) "
amitheasshole,AITA for slapping the back of a car that almost hit me while I was running?,348,2025-03-31 15:52:12,113,"So this happened yesterday morning around 6:30am. I run most days, usually while it‚Äôs still quiet out. There‚Äôs this one intersection I pass through regularly ‚Äî it's a standard city intersection with a crosswalk, and I always wait for the walk signal before crossing.

Anyway, I had the walk signal, started jogging across like usual, and a car turning left on green just *blasts* through the turn like its wheels screeched and engine roared, cutting right in front of me. Like, easily within arm‚Äôs reach. If I had been half a second faster, they would‚Äôve clipped me.

Similar situations have happened a few times before but never this close and this morning I was kind of in a bad mood and just thought man fuck this so I smacked the back of the car with my hand hard as it passed. Not hard enough to damage anything but clearly the driver heard it. Car screeches to a halt, driver rolls down the window and starts yelling at me about ‚Äútouching their f\*\*\*ing car‚Äù. I just kept running while flipping the finger, and continued on.

Told my friend and he said I was ‚Äúasking for trouble‚Äù by hitting the car and that I should‚Äôve just let it go. I guess it's a safety risk and escalating is never a good outcome, but personally felt justified in this instance.

amitheasshole,AITA for leaving my best friends house after she is triggered by trauma?,11,2025-04-01 10:59:17,14,"I have been best friends with this girl I'll call Sophie since I was 5 years old, and I love her a lot, but recently things have been difficult. I juggle school, work, and finding time to hangout with both my boyfriend of 2 and a half years and my best friend.

Sophie has mental health issues and has had them for a very long time. I've been there for her through everything. At a friends hangout that we went to last month, Sophie was discussing one of her trauma's to everybody at the hangout. We were all very supportive of her, and I'd say for about half of the hangout we discussed the awful experience she had with an abusive ex.

At the end of the night, I was going back to my boyfriend's house as he was leaving to go away for ages the next morning and I wanted to have a proper goodbye with him. We'd planned it a week before that I'd stay the night, he'd drive me home on the way, and I had a surprise for him. The second I wanted to leave, Sophie decided she was coming with me to his house without even asking. I said, ""I have to leave,"" and she just said, ""Me too,"" and came with me. I was a bit annoyed because we hangout a lot as a three and she knew he was leaving and that I wanted to say goodbye. Everything seemed fine until we got to his house and she started crying because of all that was discussed at her house.

My boyfriend and I comforted her until she could be picked up, but the second before she had to leave she turned to me and said, ""Can you stay at my house tonight instead?"" My heart dropped. I agreed immediately because that's what good friends do, and came with her. I got to her house and she told me she would have done very bad stuff to herself if I didn't come over and I felt even more awkward. After about an hour and a half of being there I just felt homesick and she seemed okay again so I told her I was gonna just sleep at my house. She became very upset again and I felt super awkward. She was asking if I had a problem with her house and what she could do to fix it and I just felt guilty.

The second I got picked up I decided that I wanted to go back to my boyfriends house. I knew it was horrible lying to my friend and leaving her house but I just really needed to say a proper goodbye to my boyfriend before he went away, and Sophie always comes over when I'm hanging out with my boyfriend; I just needed alone time.

My boyfriend got back last week and even though she knew I was going over to see him, Sophie asked me to hangout on that day. I was a bit blunt with her and told her I couldn't because I really wanted to see my boyfriend after not seeing him for ages, and then Sophie replied with, ""What about tomorrow?"" I had plans that day aswell, so she replied once again, ""What about the day after?"" It gets really frustrating, and this week for example I have work both weekend days but shes trying to convince me to sleepover at her house between shifts."
amitheasshole,WIBTA for asking my best friend to stop talking about her celebrity crush,3,2025-04-01 16:42:10,5,"I know it's a popular topic, so sorry. 

So my best friend (20F) and me (19F) text each other every day but a few months ago she developed a celebrity crush on a guy and ever since that day she just won't stop talking about him. At first, it was a bit overwhelming, but I dealt with it because I used to do the same so I can't complain or it would be hypocritical.  It's just that sometimes, I want to talk about other things or I'm feeling bad and we're having a serious conversation and then she brings him in. 

Yesterday I was telling her I was feeling lonely and  she said ""oh you haven't reacted to my text about me and....."" so I got mad and told her I was going to bed because that was the last thing I wanted to talk about.
 Sometimes I just don't know what to tell her anymore  and I wanna talk about other things, but it always circles back to him. I don't want to sound hypocritical because back then I kinda used to do the same but I was still able to have a serious conversation. 

WIBTA for not answering her texts when she just won't stop talking about him and for telling her to maybe tone it down a bit ? "
amitheasshole,AITA for lowkey contributing to my ex-friend's social isolation?,24,2025-04-01 05:07:09,16,"This is going to be a long one so please bare with me and english isn't my first language. 
 
I (23, female) have a friend, Anya (also 23 not her real name), who I‚Äôve known since high school. Anya struggled with body image issues. We supported her‚Äî helping her with tasks, encouraging her health journey, and offering advice on relationships. Despite her challenges, she maintained a positive outlook. 
But as her confidence grew, like a switch, she became obnoxious. She started treating us more like personal assistants. She‚Äôd ask us to do things for her‚Äîsmall or big‚Äîand sulk if we said no. I hated confrontation, so I usually just complied. 

The biggest mistake I made was agreeing to room with Anya in college. I was struggling financially and thought splitting rent would help. Although my family was financially stable, my course was expensive. We were friends, so living together seemed like a good idea. But it wasn‚Äôt.  Living with Anya for five months was exhausting. We set up a system for chores, but I ended up doing everything. Even when she did help, she‚Äôd act like I was making her do it. I was too afraid of controntation to say no and just dealt with it. 

Even as classmates, it wasn‚Äôt the bonding experience I expected. She‚Äôd leave me behind to hang out with her new friends but would still brag to others about how we were lifelong friends. It didn‚Äôt make sense to me. Anya also asked me for help with schoolwork, and if I was busy and said no, she sulked. But when I needed help, she wasn‚Äôt there. 

Things got worse. My mental health was already bad, but living with her made it worse. She‚Äôd always say, ‚ÄúI helped you, why can‚Äôt you do the same?‚Äù which made me feel like everything came with a price. I stopped accepting her help, and when I refused, she would get annoyed and throw everything she did for me in my face. I kept track of all the things she ‚Äúhelped‚Äù me with and paid her back immediately to stop her from holding it over me. 

Her favorite line? ""If you need anything, just ask! I‚Äôm happy to help a friend."" But then a day later, it would be ""I did this for you, you should be grateful."" 

After all that, for months, I noticed people started distancing themselves from Anya. She didn‚Äôt seem to notice, but I did. I spoke to a few classmates, and they shared their frustrations about Anya‚Äôs entitled behavior. 
She already had a bad reputation but my  petty self worsened it by telling them about my experience with as her friend for years. Of her as a student, a friend, a ""leader"". 

For the next two years of college, Anya was isolated. I realize I might‚Äôve contributed to her isolation. 

So AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for not being my brother's best man (person)?,3,2025-04-01 21:32:48,13,"My brother is getting married next month and most of his friends have bailed on him. I am his sister and he needs a best man. I am also a lesbian and dress more masculine. On top of that I am overweight and have been trying to lose weight because that also makes me uncomfortable. 

I am still pretty uncomfortable in my body and am uncomfortable with being a part of the wedding (other than attending). My brother's fianc√©'s family is pretty conservative (she isnt) I feel horrible but I don't think I can bring myself to be my brother's best man/person because I am still pretty uncomfortable in my own skin. The thought of a bunch of people staring at me and being this thing put on display even if im not going to be the exact focus literally terrifies me. My partner has been bugging me the past 2 days about doing it and that it won't be that bad. We fought for hours yesterday and when we came home from work today about it. 

 I already avoid embarrassing social situations like the plague and I feel like this will make me super uncomfortable. Every time I think of it, I want to throw up or do worse things to myself so I don't have to do it. 

I haven't said yes. In fact, I tried to explain how it would make me feel to be the odd one out in the wedding and no one seems to care. Everyone just thinks I'm being a jerk. He does have at least 1 maybe 2 more people he can ask. I love my brother but I don't think I can bring myself to do this. "

Anyway last week we were just doing our normal thing of hanging out in his basement and drinking and out of the blue after like 2 hours chilling he just says ""I'm bored, let's see who can ignore [me] for the longest"" and then proceeds to ignore me for the rest of the night. Nobody else followed along or even really acknowledged what he said, but he still refused to speak to me or respond to what I was saying.

I assumed he was done with his ""joke"" I guess, but nope he's still doing it and just ignoring me. He went so far as to not even open his apartment door when he saw it was me and one of the others let me in.

I offered to buy her ear protection and a sleep mask if she chose ones that weren't too expensive to avoid further issue, she flat-out refused. I then told her that I couldn't do much else, given that I already try my best to be quiet and offer other solutions and her persistent refusal to accept the solutions shouldn't be creating more problems for me.

amitheasshole,AITA for forcing my in-laws into a smaller space for their larger family?,3360,2025-03-31 00:32:36,443,"Update: 

so after the first two days of being in the park we have had a significant Improvement of attitudes between everyone. Actually, after the first night and me posting this after my argument with them and my husband, they woke up after sleeping in the other camper and everyone had their own bed but it was cramped and the teens all came to our camper to shower since the one in theirs isn't tall enough for the two boys. I had a ""Come to Jesus"" meeting with my husband about the behavior, attitude and general disrespect exhibited by him the previous day about a situation that wasn't even our fault. 

Some here told me to post it in the story but we called an agency that worked with Fort Wilderness and they directly asked us about how many adults would be in the camper. Husband told them that it would be 2 adults and then the teens. They are the ones who provided the camper and said it would be sufficient for their needs without us getting to see a floor plan. Before they left for the day, we had a ""come to Jesus"" meeting for all of the adults in which after the first meeting, my husband took the reigns on this and said that he wasn't going to have future vacations with them because of the disrespectful behaviors. That he did his best and going forward, if they want to have something better, they need to build a vacation savings and do it themselves.

Many of redditors called me the AH and I took their advice about making some kind of compromise. I, again offered a compromise to trade for the remainder of the trip as long as my toddler and I had access to my camper. They said no. So I offered a different compromise that the kids could stay in ours as long as they were quiet after toddler went to sleep. The 18yr old and 16yr old are both very tall (6'4"") and asked to sleep in the garage on our queen and on an air mattress. They have their own access into the garage so they can come and go as they please. The toddler is sleeping with us. Now everyone kind of has their own space and the mood has improved dramatically. I'm holding my boundary that I am not doing another vacation with the adults. The kids offered to sleep in a tent because of their parents anger at the space available in the camper. They are just happy to be here and said they would sleep in a tent or the back of the truck to not be in their parents way. 


Original story: 

So this story is my family (husband, me, 2yr old) and his brother's family (BIL, SIL, and three teens:18, 16, 13) 

So we are at Disney this week. We arrived today with our camper and rented another one from the resort. When we got here for check in, we were told the other camper was set up, got the keys and was shown some features. It was small (I think 25ft) with the only privacy being the master bed. There is a bunk and the dining table folds into a bed. 

We set up our camper (40ft toy hauler) and I'm in the middle of putting out linens, opening up the back porch for my toddler to play and getting his space set up (sleeps in the garage area) when the in-laws roll up. We all greet and my husband shows them their camper. Immediately they start down the ""this isn't big enough. We are going to have issues. We really don't like this"" comments. Now we paid for the camper rental, the spots, the tickets into the park and for some upcoming dinners they wanted reserved. My husband goes into a panic and they walk into our camper and say ""let's just stay here and you guys take the little one"". 

I said no that wasn't going to work cause our bed in the master is specifically for my back. They went on about how they can't afford Disney and it's really disappointing that all we rented was a small trailer for all of them to fit into without regards to their comfort. I came back with ""it's only for sleep for your family. I don't know if my son is going to be overwhelmed and having a familiar space for him to play and relax from the noises and crowds is why we brought ours"" and they stormed out calling me an asshole and asking my husband why he married me. He came back to me with the fact that we don't need all of the room since its just three of us and they have 5 and all are basically adults. So I asked a simple question, ""then I get access while you guys are at Disney to be in here and relax?"" (Ours has a TV and a porch with barriers for the toddler to play outside in an enclosed area. Also his toys are in here)  And they said it's their private area so no. So I said no again. My husband called me an asshole and said our son can survive a week without toys and the porch area etc. 

Am I the asshole because i don't want to sacrifice my own comfort to appease them especially since we have paid for this entire trip? The only part they had to pay for was to get here and they flew (with some assistance from my husband cause I ""threw a fit about that"")

amitheasshole,AITAH for not donating to a coworker‚Äôs fundraiser?,799,2025-03-31 08:04:20,233,"So, this has been weighing on me because now work feels *weird*, and I don‚Äôt know if I handled it wrong.

One of my coworkers, *Sarah*, is raising money for her dog‚Äôs surgery. I totally get it‚Äîshe‚Äôs devastated, and I feel for her. She set up a GoFundMe and has been going around the office asking people to donate.

Here‚Äôs where the problem started: I didn‚Äôt donate. Not because I don‚Äôt care, but because I *literally* can‚Äôt afford to. I‚Äôve had some unexpected medical bills and car repairs, and I‚Äôm barely keeping up with rent. I also have my own pet who needs regular care, so I can‚Äôt justify spending money I don‚Äôt have, even for a good cause.

Sarah never asked me directly, but other coworkers did. When I said I couldn‚Äôt right now, they just went, ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ okay,‚Äù but the vibe shifted. Then, a couple of days later, I heard Sarah venting to another coworker in the break room, saying, *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just disappointing when some people act like they care but can‚Äôt even chip in ten bucks. I guess their morning lattes are more important.‚Äù*

And yeah‚Ä¶ I buy coffee most mornings. Because it‚Äôs, you know, part of my budget. But now I feel like I‚Äôm being judged for *not* skipping a coffee to donate.

It got worse. Someone put up a donation tally in the break room, listing how much everyone contributed. My name was the only one missing. Another coworker joked, *‚ÄúOof, harsh,‚Äù* when they saw it, and now I feel *super* awkward every time I walk into the kitchen.

I thought about donating something just to make the tension go away, but honestly, the pettiness is making me not want to. Still, I don‚Äôt want to be the office villain over this.

So, AITAH for not donating? Or should I have just thrown in a few dollars to avoid the drama?"
amitheasshole,AITA for turning away my partner's grandparents when they showed up unannounced?,4883,2025-03-30 21:42:31,282,"My partner and I had twins in February. We're currently living in her parents' neighboring house because they acquired it after the neighbor passed away, and we're renting/renovating it with them. We have set clear boundaries that we don't want surprise visitors, and we would like it if they only came over once or twice a week so we can have some privacy. 

Today, my partner's dad texted her while she was trying to nap, letting her know that her grandmother (his mother) had shown up at their house unannounced. We appreciated the heads-up, and she continued with trying to rest, as the twins were finally fed, changed, and no longer being fussy. About 10-15 minutes later, her phone starts ringing, and I see it's her dad. I answered, and he let me know her grandma and grandpa were walking over. I told him I would turn them away, as everyone was finally sleeping and it wasn't a good time. He said ""You shouldn't do that, because it will start a fight."" I said ""Oh well, it's not a good time.""

Her grandparents rang the doorbell twice during that phone call, almost back to back, waking her and one of the boys up. I told her to just keep sleeping, I'll deal with it. I answered the door, and her grandma could tell I was exhausted, because she asked if we were sleeping. I said ""Yes, we all are."" She said ""Too bad,"" and tried stepping towards the door. I pulled it shut a little more so it was barely open enough for me, and told her ""No. It's not a good time. They haven't been sleeping good, and I don't want them waking up since they're finally asleep."" She pretended she was ok with it, and parted ways.

A few minutes later, my partner called her dad with the boys screaming in the background, telling him we turned them away. He did what he usually does when he's mad, and kept giving short, one or two word replies. Then, after she was done talking, he blew up, talking about how he's going to have to deal with her grandma being pissed off now, and saying something like ""I might as well fucking broadcast your damn rules to everyone to not show up unless they call ahead!"" along with some other stuff I didn't catch, as I was in the other room. She started crying, said bye while he was still yelling, and hung up.

Now I feel like I shouldn't have told her grandparents to come back another day, because her dad apparently can't deal with his mother's (or his own) emotions, and it would've been easier to just deal with them coming in and disturbing the peace that we had just managed to establish. So, AITA for turning them away? Should I have just dealt with them coming in for a little while?"

She had to leave unexpectedly and had to find someone to sublet her room fast.

My new roommate ‚ÄúStacey‚Äù (F 28) stayed with me for about almost 2 years before things turned sour. I won‚Äôt get into detail for the sake of the story but she was very controlling and made multiple rules on what I could and could not do in the apartment, even though I was there first. I finally put my foot down after a year and a half of her telling me what I could and couldn‚Äôt do in the apartment and that‚Äôs when she absolutely snapped. A month or two after this incident happened, she decided she could no longer live in the apartment and had to leave.

My brother and I grew up with Nate and his little brother we spent the night at eachothers houses went on family trips together and spent our entire childhoods together. They have known me since before I was born. They treated me like their little sister our whole lives. We've been playing online games together as a group since my brother moved out of my parents house after high school 11 years ago. It's always my brother,  Nate and I playing. We normally play with extra people and we can sometimes rope in Nates little brother and it's a lot of fun and a way for me to spend time with my brother. Nate and I never play alone together amd we never have. Nate is married and I'm in a committed relationship. One night my brother, Nate and I were out drinking with some other friends and Nate being a lightweight started acting little reckless and out of the norm. At one point he started hanging over me alot and started massaging my shoulders. I was a little uncomfortable with the situation and my brother wasn't paying attention so I brought up Nates wife. I told him he must give his wife massages a lot trying to remind him he was married and I'm not his wife. He then told me he would never do this for his wife and the 3rd friend that was with us raised his brows and walked away saying he would give us some privacy. I quickly messaged my brother and told him the situation. My brother came out to check on us and eventually left us alone again. Nate proceeded compliment me and tell me that I've grown up a lot and he never would have thought a tomboy could look this beautiful I said thanks and tried to laugh it off and made a jab at him saying I never thought his sexist ass would find a wife. He laughed it off and started rubbing my arms then told that he really wanted to kiss me. I then shut it down and told him I think he's had a few too many drinks and brought him to join my brother. I never want to keep secrets from my boyfriend but I knew it might cause issues in the future so after a few days I told him what happened. He was pissed and rightfully so. I had to convince him not to go fight Nate and I told him Nate was so drunk I don't even think he remembers it. A few weeks later my brother and Nate invited me to play a game and Nate was acting completely normal. I genuinely think he forgot what happened and I dont want to lose someone I thought of as family. But now every time I get on a game with my brother my boyfriend asks me if Nate is going to be on I believe in being honest to keep trust and never break it so I always tell him if he is. He never makes a pass at me we make normal jokes you would typically hear in a gaming lobby. Everything has been normal but I can still tell it makes my boyfriend uncomfortable. Am I the asshole for wanting to stay friends so I can still play games with the boys? Should I just stop playing games with everyone? I really dont want to be alone all the time. "

I never mentioned there being such gods in my world but I let him go on. So the first thing I told him was I didnt like the idea of giving him 6 artifact level items as they rarely get 2 in my games. Come today when I pitched the idea of the next campaign and said it would be based around the layers of hell, so nothing really relating to going around the world, which he then said ""Ill have to make a new character then"" and at first went on about how the character was half tiefling, by this point I kinda forgot the character, so i questioned why the character wouldnt work and then he reminded me that it was the character who wants to collect the 6 artifacts, I basically told him that for a character like that to work I would basically have to make the campaign centered around just that, which would make it a game for him with C simply there tagging along, which wouldnt be fun IMO, I wont lie when I say his response set me off a bit.

Him (G): If a player character coming into a campaign with a goal that involves trying to find stuff is something that is to complex for you to think of a way to implement it into an adventure then I‚Äôll just make characters without goals for you then

Me: Your entire goal with this character is to have him travel the entire world with the only goal to find these artifacts in which i have already said my dislike for the fact of you want 6 artifacts, and then you have the balls to complain when i dont want to use your characters after a campaign has ended, you sit there saying that each of these artifacts would be found here, here, here, here, over here, and here as if i shouldnt have a say in where the they would be even if i did do this idea, in which again you decided they should span the entire world so yea G id say its a little hard to have you focus on something completely different since you have a habit of making characters with one goal in mind, in which when i try to convince you to have them grow its wrong and they wouldnt but then in one session you act as if their entire mind set has changed over night, so fine G ill make you happy as i always do because me and C dont get to sit here and have fun of our own, we dont get to play dnd without you so god forbid we need to cater to your every request or else you might just fucking disappear and we wont get to play something we both love to play, so fine G ill remake the campaign to cater to your idea, just as i always have, because you seem to never let me forget, you dm your own game and you have been doing this longer so you know better than i do."
amitheasshole,AITA for ignoring my ex and having too much fun at a  party?,83,2025-03-31 18:05:18,63,"
I (24M) broke up with my ex (23F) on bad terms seven months ago. Since then, she started dating a close friend of hers, while I‚Äôve stayed single, enjoying my freedom and the occasional fling.

We both go to the same college and were separately invited to a pool party hosted by mutual friends. The group (around 25 people) included some of my best friends, my ex, her boyfriend, and her friends and a lot of our classmates. 

I didn‚Äôt interact with her at all throughout the day, just had fun with my friends and mingled with her friends, whom I hadn‚Äôt spoken to much since the breakup. The party continued into the night, and I drank and danced a lot.

Around 9 PM, my ex approached my best friend and said she wanted to talk to me. I made it clear that I wasn‚Äôt interested and continued enjoying myself.

After 3 AM, most people had gone to sleep or passed out except for her friends, and I kept partying with them, including dancing with her best friend (23F), who didn‚Äôt seem to mind at all and we had a lot of fun.  This went on until 6-7 AM, after which I crashed.

Later that day, I found out my ex had been calling people, complaining that I was ‚Äúhaving too much fun with her friends.‚Äù Some people sided with me, while others said I was an asshole for ignoring her and refusing to talk.

TL;DR:

My ex (23F) and I (24M) broke up badly seven months ago. At a mutual friend‚Äôs party, I ignored her completely and partied with her friends. She later called people, complaining that I was having ‚Äútoo much fun‚Äù with them. Now, some say I was right, while others think I was an asshole for not talking to her."

The most recent example I can give is a concert. It‚Äôs important to note, he is physically disabled and is in need of a wheelchair sometimes. He can stand independently of the wheelchair, and has always been able to. 

Anyways, the venue staff failed to make sure there was enough room for everyone on the disabled platform and they ended up having to direct everyone into the regular standing area. Everyone managed to make it but one from the barrier, where a few girls refused to move because they had paid VIP tickets and gotten there really early to ensure a good space. They apologised as well as saying they appreciated the situation. I think this was a fair response, but my friend took offence and decided to leave before the concert started.

One of their friends mocked them before leaving too, saying ‚ÄúI get you paid for VIP, but you know, at least you can walk,‚Äù. 

Keeping in mind, my friend CAN still stand and walk, and they were only behind one person from barrier. 

I understand they‚Äôre disappointed but I think it was really rude and clearly upsetting, because the girl started crying after that. I want to bring it up to them, because it really tires me out that I have to keep acting like I don‚Äôt think their entitlement ruins a lot of good things, as this is just one of many experiences I‚Äôve witnessed. So, WIBTA if I tried to talk to them about their entitlement towards this girl?

EDIT: sorry, I‚Äôve phrased this kind of terribly - I‚Äôm just emotionally conflicted and I didn‚Äôt know how to convey it properly. To be clearer, I believe he deserves disability accommodation - the thoughts on entitlement was more towards the girl who wouldn‚Äôt give up her space. He always wants someone else to accommodate for him, even when it‚Äôs not their responsibility - and often times it has nothing to do with his physical disabilities, it‚Äôs just that in this instance it was "
amitheasshole,AITAH for telling my wife her homophobic family can‚Äôt stay with us,5017,2025-03-30 20:01:27,580,"My wife and I have been together for about 2.5 years. Her family is very conservative and homophobic, and have been so for entirely too long imo when they have a gay daughter. This territory is nothing new to them. She came out to them when she was 18, (she is 31) she has an ex wife that she was married to for 8 years, and they have a son together. It‚Äôs truly shocking how close minded they still are to her lifestyle. 

They‚Äôve always been pretty cold toward me, when we were dating it was so obvious how differently her straight sisters in their straight relationships were treated. This has always bothered me, but they live about 3 hours away so I‚Äôm able to keep my distance and them out of my mind for the most part. My wife has accepted the way they are as just how it is, and she thinks it‚Äôs worth just letting things be - in order to keep any kind of relationship with them. 

This dynamic has always bothered me, but things really came to a head last fall when one of her sisters got married. Her entire family was so involved with every part of the process, it was obviously such a big deal, and they were all super excited. At the wedding, my fianc√©e at the time was a bridesmaid/in the wedding party. I was sat with the rest of the family, who did not acknowledge me, talk to me, interact with me at all the entire time. They truly acted as if they had no idea who I was, meanwhile they are fawning over their straight daughter and her marriage while I‚Äôm sitting there knowing I‚Äôm planning to marry their gay daughter in the next few months. It made me really sad and angry. I drew a line. I told my fianc√©e at the time that the way they acted like I was a ghost was the last straw and that if they want to act like I don‚Äôt exist, they are also dead to me. 

Fast forward to now, we are married (eloped thanks to the scariness of this administration). My wife informs me that her dad and her stepmom want to come visit in a couple of weeks. (They have never once visited us, and are coming bc my wife‚Äôs son will be on spring break). Apparently they are planning to stay with us too. I got upset and told my wife I don‚Äôt want them in my house. I hate being disrespected when I‚Äôve done nothing but try my best to be a part of the family, and have just gotten rejected over and over again. I thought they would come around, but the dynamic was almost worse once we were engaged. I don‚Äôt know what to do. There‚Äôs no way my wife will tell them they can‚Äôt come and she‚Äôs never been willing to have a conversation with them about this. I just can‚Äôt imagine being forced to host them. AITAH?

ETA: thank you everyone for the positive reinforcement and suggestions for how to navigate this tricky situation. Obviously I knew this was an issue before we got married. Again with the family distance and my love and commitment for her, this was not enough to not get married. I had told her my red line after her sister‚Äôs wedding, which was that I would not be participating or traveling for family stuff unless something changed. So this planned visit without my input first was a bit of a shock. Since posting, I have told her that she either needs to finally have a conversation with them, ask them to stay in a hotel, or that I will leave for the weekend. After a long discussion she has told me she‚Äôll have the conversation. So here‚Äôs hoping some progress is made!"
amitheasshole,AITA for how ive acted to people,0,2025-04-01 17:46:14,9,"Ive been having some problems in school socially. My friends have been ignoring me out of the blue and refused to talk or acknowledged me. They even hide/blocked me on any social media platforms and have been talking about me to other people behind my back.. for some time ive been wondering on what happened to make them act like that towards me all of the sudden. I was hurt because 1 year of friendship and memories was thrown out of the window all of the sudden..

Now, in january one of my friend from my dormitory pulled me aside to talk to me about something important. In the talk she told me how shes been frustrated towards me..she told me that ive been acting childish, annoying and immature...she said that she finds me talking about my interest that she doesn't know is annoying and draining for her and she doesn't like how i like to compare things and how i whine and complain too much. I listened and understood what she said while apologizing for my actions. She pointed out that other people have been feeling the same things towards me and how people only talked or tolerated me just because im friends with her....i apologized to her and explained how i didnt realized my actions were bad and i never meant to make anyone frustrated and drained..i said that ill try to change and work on myself more.

After that talk i decided to talk less and mind my business more...back then I would bud into conversations that im not included or invited to and I would me nosy and try to get into people's buisness...which i admit, it was shitty and i regret that. 

A 2 months went by and im still doing the thing ive been doing since the talk. Speaking less, minding my own buisness, only speak when im invited to a conversation or someone speaks to me first. It was doing good i supposed until...i noticed that people started to avoid and ignore me again...and then, my dormmate friend pulled me aside again. 

I already had a bad feeling about this because shes been acting cold and ignoring me for weeks...She pulled me to my room and she said how she was having a talk with some of my 'friends' and say that ive been acting worse than a few months ago...how ive been more immature and draining to other people so they started to ignore me again. She said how she felt like she feels the burden of trying to carry my social life even though ive never asked for her to do that and how she feels like a parent for having to talk to me about my own social life. I apologized and just go silent...

After she left my room i felt confused and frustrated on myself. I thought ive been doing well but turns out ive made the situation worse without me noticing. 

I made a vow to myself to not do anything anymore. I wont try to talk to anyone anymore. Just be silent...just be someone whos in the background because im scared that ill hurt someone else or hurt my friends more...

Thinking now im conflicted if this this the right thing to do or should i try again...

Am i the asshole in this situation?

amitheasshole,AITA if I say no to letting my sister wear my wedding dress?,2364,2025-03-30 23:38:54,833,"I (34F) have a sister (37F) who just recently got engaged in February. My sister and I have never been close growing up, to the point where this summer we went no contact after another argument. My partner and I will have been married 3 years this August, and after my partner proposed my sister messaged me saying she did not want to be involved in the wedding or even hear about wedding plans. Although hurtful I complied, and now that she is getting married she has begun to make contact again. Today while talking to my mother she mentioned that my sister had said she wants to wear my wedding veil. I told her that was okay as long as I could give it to her with a box stating ‚Äúsomething borrowed‚Äù as I have already offered it to two other friends with upcoming weddings. Then my mother informs me my sister and her partner are getting married the weekend of my and my partners wedding anniversary, that they are booking the same photographer, that she wants her photos taken in the same location as mine- and then asked if my sister could wear my dress (which she would have to have fitted so it would never be my dress again). I expressed to my mother I wasn‚Äôt sure about using my dress and how I wanted to keep it. However, my father chimed in to the phone call saying I should ‚Äújust give it to her‚Äù. AITA if I say no? 


[TL/DR - My older sister plans to get married on my anniversary weekend, wear my dress and  veil, and take pictures at the same location as I did. AITA to say she can‚Äôt wear my dress?] 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented and gave advice. I appreciate the support and some kicks in the a** to remind me that my feelings matter. I have my dress and it will be going to a safe place this week. As this conversation started with my mother I told her that my dress and veil are off limits. I said  my sister can talk to me should she want then and I can tell her the same- that I will not be sharing my things.  Thanks again for the support, my mother was not so understanding and your comments are helpful to keep me strong. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not inviting my cousin on a camping trip?,4,2025-04-01 08:46:33,8," Last year my cousin (m27) got into a verbal altercation, on a camping trip, with my crush (m26) who is now my fianc√©. My cousin has been a really good guy in the past but also has built himself a reputation for being mean. I love him but he crossed a line when he decided too secretly wait for Alex (fake name/crush) too be by himself too yell at him too leave and, how he doesn‚Äôt deserve to have my family and I as his friends. My crush ends up leaving that night saying he had a work emergency. He didn‚Äôt tell us my cousin asked him too leave. My cousin tells us the next morning what happened after he‚Äôs gone. I was heartbroken because I wanted too really hangout with Alex and my cousin knew that too. During the argument, my cousin shared with me how he told Alex ‚ÄúI almost liked you and now I feel bad that my cousin has feelings for you.‚Äù This was last year and he never apologized too Alex. My fianc√© says he‚Äôs moved on and he doesn‚Äôt mind him coming but I do. I don‚Äôt want that energy around my relationship or myself. I love my cousin but for him too bully someone I love is out of line. My brother says I‚Äôm overreacting and I should be okay with my cousin coming on trips with my love and I.

amitheasshole,AITA for the April fools prank I pulled in my sister?,0,2025-04-02 00:53:20,42,"I 14m pulled a prank on my little sister today 10f for April fools day cuz I thought it'd be funny but it ended up making her mad. 

Our family loves horror, I read and watch a ton of horror and our whole family watches horror movies together and we all love it. 

We have Halloween decorations in our basememt of Pennywise, Freddy Krueger, giant spiders and all kinds of other stuff, and we also have a Chucky Halloween decoration. I went with the Chucky decoration cuz it would be the easiest to get out and back in. 

My sister had soccer practice today so I put it in her booster seat in our car to scare her before she went to soccer practice. And it worked. 

She asked if i put it there and when I said yeah she got really mad at me cuz when it happened she was with her new friend who she really likes and her friend saw her get scared by the Chucky decoration and laughed at her and now she's really embarrassed. 


I told her it was just an April fools joke but she said I was a jerk for making her scared in front of her friend. 

I tried to tell her good luck at soccer practice before she left to make sure we were still good but she just said "" don't talk to me you jerk "". 


AITA? 


I apologized to my sister and explained to her I didn't mean to embarrass her in front of her friend and make her look bad in front of her friend, she  accepted my apology and we hugged it out. We're good now!

amitheasshole,AITAH for telling my sister to stop trauma dumping to win arguments,5,2025-04-01 08:24:34,9,"This one is kinda long, sorry bout that. Me (19) and my sister (24) are fairly close, it hasn't always been like this though. Long story short I guess you could say I was a golden child, I have various chronic conditions which resulted in me and my sister being raised fairly differently. We also lived separately for a decent chunk of my childhood. She lived with my mum and I stayed with my dad, we'd visit eachother every once in a while. Though we we sorta close when I was young as I got older I was fairly certain she didn't like me up untill the big pandemic, we quarantined together and learned we were quite similar and have been friends since. There's just one problem though, she can't apologize without being petty.

She has this sorry but mentality. Her apologies always sound a little like ""Sorry I was mean to you but u were worse to me when we were younger."" The statement itself isn't a lie as I was a brat, I hated being sick and that caused me to lash out and lie. Sometimes my actions would directly or indirectly get her implicated. The thing is she'd get harsher punishment as she doesn't get golden child privilege. I'm aware of this and I do feel bad, but when we became friends we agreed to leave out our past. This isn't to be petty but she was also not I nice kid to be around, there's a reason I thought she didn't like me. She just can't seem to leave my past behind but has no problem leaving behind hers. If we have an argument I might win she's trauma dumping midway through even when it's unrelated. She always finds a way to bring in her rough childhood. I could be saying stop making fun of my lisp and she'd say, well I was bullied for mine.

The point is I always end up feeling guilt tripped and apologize, heck most of the time idek what the original arguments were about. Yesterday she did it again and I got sick of it. I told her "" I love you but at this point I'm tired of being your friend. Stop bringing up your trauma to guilt trip me into saying you're right"", I called her manipulative and told her she's not a tragic novel protog. I sent a msg that said ""You stop doing this or we stop talking, I don't wanna be friends with someone that makes me feel like trash"" I also said some other things I'm not so proud of in the heat of the moment. She's just always bringing up my past I've moved on from to make me feel like a bad person. Something we agreed to leave in the past for the sake of our friendship, I think I was just tired of being her emotional punching bag.

The point is it's been over 24hrs and I've cooled off, I haven't gotten a response yet though. Normally we text everyday, even after I said all this we are close, and after cooling off I do feel bad. I rlly do wanna stay friends, I didn't mean it when I said I didn't want to. Maybe there was a better way to handle this? Give it to me straight, should I go apologize? AITAH?"
amitheasshole,AITA for feeding my daughters soft ball team ‚Äújunk‚Äù at our sleepover,6882,2025-03-30 17:39:20,1615,"I35f have 3 children all enrolled in extra curricular‚Äôs. My oldest daughter who‚Äôs 13, plays in softball and has for years. I live in a smaller town, so I know the other girls parents and we are well aquatinted I even consider a few of them friends. We take turns having big huge sleepovers for the girls at our homes and this weekend it was my daughters weekend.

We had never discussed what we should and should not feed the girls, just allergies and such so I didn‚Äôt think there were ‚Äúrules.‚Äù My other child is also in sports and I have never had complains about this either and I‚Äôve hosted these sleepovers before, just not this season yet and there are a few mothers newer parents to the team. Anyways, I had bought the girls pizza and breadsticks, and had pink or regular lemonade offered for dinner. I also had a lot of snacks, mostly chips, but I did bake some brownies as well. The next morning I had just got a lot of Dunkin‚Äô Donuts. It‚Äôs 15 girls I‚Äôm feeding so I figured it was easiest because these type of things feed alot of children. My children don‚Äôt normally eat like this either, I just was excited for the first sleepover at our house this season.

Anyways, I‚Äôve gotten some complains from the newer moms to have joined the group in our groupchat, and have said that I shouldn‚Äôt be loading their children up on sugar and junk food and how their kids don‚Äôt eat like that at home. I replied back that it was a sleepover it was suppose to be a fun event for the girls so what was the big deal? That offended them; they accused me of undermining their parenting and said there daughters wouldn‚Äôt be coming to my daughters sleepovers anymore unless I decided to feed them better food. This caused an argument because like I said no one has ever mentioned what they feed the children at these sleepovers, and there was never any ‚Äúrules.‚Äù I thought it was fair game. I then again said it was just fun food, it was a slumber party, and a few of the other parents agreed with me. 

A few hours later that mother replied in the gc that her daughter would no longer be coming to any events at my home since I couldn‚Äôt see that fun food was just a different word for junk. Then called me a lousy mother for feeding children up with that shit, then left the groupchat.

Now as we are weeks away from her wedding she informs me she has hired another photographer from another company and she would love for me and my team to work beside them and hopefully understand their vibe. This all started when the guest count for her ceremony and reception went up to number that would require me to bring someone from my team. When she informed me the guest count went up I told her I‚Äôd find a second photographer to assist me. She instead found another photographer (who is the main photographer of their respected company). I tried to explain to her hows it‚Äôs my responsibility to find a second photographer to shoot under me. Her response was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôd now have 2 different types of edits for my wedding, 2 different styles‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt agree with that and tried to explain the difference of hiring 2 separate companies for the same purpose as opposed to 1 company with 2 photographers. I backed out and told her to stick to the other company she booked. Given my frustration I have decided to not attend the wedding at all. (My cousin doesn‚Äôt know this part).

For a little context my grandma passed away last year and for her birthday we went out to grave and celebrated and it was nice I had a really good time. Now that I got that out of the way yesterday I was supposed to go and do it again then go out to dinner with my family. But I decided not to go as when we did it last year I loved and didn't want to do again just cuz there were going to be more people there etc. Also I have a lot of school stuff due soon the marking period ends this week also I entered a contest and I need to prepare for that. So I told my mom I didn't want to go and this lead to us getting in to a argument and I feel like all she saw was that I was trying to challenge her or something I don't know. But she said I don't ever do things with my family when that's not true I just like going to do things I don't like to do especially if I know I'm not going to be happy and bring the mood down also she always wants me to do stuff with her but I suggest we do something we almost never do so I just feel like she not seeing where I'm coming from. Then later that day she called me to tell me sister phone had died and that they didn't know where is. I got worried hoping she was ok and then my says this is why I wanted y'all to go together and I feel like she was trying to make me feel bad or guilty and that really hurt my feelings but they ended up finding her and instead of calling me back my mom just texted me saying they had her. Now I'm at school wondering if I was in the wrong, and I feel bad and like I don't want to my mom but at the same time I have an event on Thursday after school my family was supposed to come to but I feel like I don't have the right to ask them to come since I was not there but I want them to come because they have always came it's one of the few times they come to see me from Philly as I usually go to see them. So would I be wrong to ask them to still come or should I just forget about it? And was I the asshole? Sorry if this was bad or hard to understand if you made it this far thanks for reading."

They sometimes leave me alone at home for a few days if some work comes up. A similar instance happened and i was alone for 3 days. They came back life went as normal now a few days back my aunt was removing her nail polish and the remover was not working. She automatically assumed that i had something to do with it. However she put it to my mother camly and she talked to me
 I ofc refused because how the fuck can i be responsible for a remover refusing to remove nail polish? I told her i had nothing to with it. My aunt also accused me of going around snooping in her stuff which I ofc did not. Now yesterday I went around 4 shops to buy a nail polish remover but did not find it and it was getting late and shops were closing so i went back home. After dinner she asked for my nail polsih remover and i gave it to her but very little was left which i was unaware of. She started looking at me with anger and i said in what i believe was a calm tone but both of them said otherwise that its okay I'll go and buy it tmrw. She flared up at this comment idk why and started yelling and saying that i was the one who fiddled with her things and whatnot. I very calmly replied that i did nothing and ofc why would she listen to me,she again started shouting and i just walked off up to my room. She continued shouting which i obvuously ignored.

In the entire time that I‚Äôve known him, he has been a kind, caring, loving man. I can see him being the father of my children. But since we moved in together, I‚Äôve discovered he has one extremely annoying habit: he insists on listening to  music while we‚Äôre watching TV.

I mean, we‚Äôll be sitting down and watching a show and he‚Äôll be blasting music on a speaker while we do it. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the show is. He‚Äôll listen to anything: country, death metal, classical, rap. Ive brought this up several times, telling him that it‚Äôs incredibly distracting and makes it impossible to concentrate, much less enjoy, whatever we‚Äôre watching. But he says it‚Äôs the only way HE can keep his concentration, and sometimes will go so far as to mute the show or movie and just watch it with subtitles and his music playing.

My breaking point came the other day when we were watching Twilight. He had already been playing songs, but midway through the movie, he muted it and started absolutely BLASTING Breaking Benjamin. I had enough and told him we could either watch the movie like regular people or not at all. He got really upset, turned off the movie and the music, and stormed off.

This is my first time spending his birthday with him since we have been dating and I am not too sure as to what to get him. He is going into the military soon and it will be the last birthday I spend with him for a little while. I want to do something special but I i told her I have no ideas. (Please give ideas for a 19 yr old guy) she then decided to be completely rude to me cussing me out and degrading me saying rude things about me and said he deserves better. I told him about this and he just comforted me and said I should ghost her and move on in life.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my husband he can't bring one of the cars unless he asks permission from my parents?,11,2025-04-01 02:54:34,20,"A little background: We live in one property with my parents and siblings. It's basically a compound with my parents and unmarried sibs in one house, married sibling and family in another and my family in another house. But garage is shared. We have several cars but most of them belong to my parents. Married sib has one car from when she was still single, her husband has one but sold it to get a family car. I had one from when I was single, but sold it when my family ran into some financial troubles (my husband's doing)...so we basically borrow from my parents.

So today, my husband is going to have a meeting after lunch and a birthday dinner to go to. Being my day off of work, he knew that I had plans today with the kids (11yo and 3yo) and taking one of the cars with us. He declared he will also bring a car (one of the cars). I told him he should ask permission from mom or dad, which in my opinion, is just right since they aren't ours. I mean, as their child, I still ask permission whenever I use one of the cars.
He got pissed. And even had the attitude in front of my mom. 

Edited to add: He was mumbling something and gave a pretty final, ""OK! BUT I AM GOING TO BRING A CAR!""

He hasn't asked my parents yet if he can bring one of the cars today, and I'm guessing he's waiting for the last minute like literally when he's going out the door.

I sometimes feel like I might be TA but his attitude about the whole thing ever since he started driving (like 3 years) is just off and my mind always screams he's TA. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not sharing my wifi password,296,2025-03-31 08:24:25,75,"I live in work accomodation in a bunch of flats. I am currently the only one who lives here permanently. Work keeps putting people in the other flats (from one night up to three weeks).

When the flats were permanently tenanted I shared the costs of wifi with the other tenants. However, now it is just me. 

There is no cell service here, so when people visit I have given them my wifi password. However, usually the people have only been here for a night or two. This time there are four people here for a month. So I said I pay for the wifi myself, it's not provided through work.

My workmates have made me feel mean for not giving the password out. I feel guilty too.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my mom she can't come to my graduation?,47,2025-03-31 17:34:43,39,"For some backstory, after I graduated highschool, my mom got caught stealing from her job and was fired. She kept this hidden from my sibling and I for months despite us being on her insurance (so we unknowingly had no insurance that whole time) and only found out when my sibling was told at the doctor's office. After job hopping around for a while, she moved away to live with a new boyfriend (where she still couldn't hold down a job). She would come back to visit for some holidays, but without fail she would come back to celebrate her birthday.
 
During all this, she opened a credit card under my name and used it for a year and a half. She eventually stopped paying for it and let it go into deliquency, ruining my credit score. I only found this out a year later when I applied for my first credit card and was denied. I found out that the card had one of her previous addresses and her phone number on it, so I gave her a chance to confess. She denied it until I sent her a screenshot with the proof, and then made up a million excuses for doing it. I cut her off after this and haven't seen her since. 

Which brings us to now, where I'm graduating in May and she's expecting to come to the ceremony. I told her I don't want her there, and now my family is divided. One side says I should give her another chance and it was just a mistake. They say she's the only mom I've got and I'll regret it if I cut her out of my life. The other side agrees with me that she needs to have consequences, and the fact that she lied to me so many times about it shows she didn't really feel bad for doing it. I think if she truly regretted it she would have called the credit card company herself and gotten it off my records instead of making me do it all myself. Because I got it off my records and isn't directly hurting me now, many family members think I should move on and forgive her. So AITA for holding a grudge over this and making her miss out on an important life event for me? 

TLDR: My mom opened a credit card under my name and let it go into deliquency, so I told her she can't come to my college graduation. "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my unsupportive uncle I am trans then telling him to fuck off because he doesn‚Äôt support me but supports other trans,0,2025-04-02 05:05:53,9,"Alright, I (MTF 21) recently came out about being transgender lesbain. Most of my family are vary supportive of this change in my life. And even people at my shelter. I recently have been vary open about it because that I feel it would help me through the changes. Well one morning I texted my uncle (M57) saying that we need to talk and I would like him to be supportive. He was always supportive of other transgender MTF that I brought home when I was dating them so I thought this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Later that day I get a text saying ‚Äúok call‚Äù from my uncle. So I called him.  I then proceeded to give him a call and tell him that I am a transgender to hear ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, fuck you goodbye‚Äù then he hung up on me. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. I called my aunt about it(F65) and she said ‚ÄúIm glad you told me, last thing I need is for you to be offended by me assuming pronouns‚Äù. Not long after this I called my GF (F25) and told her what my uncle had told me. She said ‚ÄúI will call and find out what‚Äôs going on but don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù  After I got a response about what he had said my GF told me that he doesn‚Äôt support LGBTQ because they didn‚Äôt exist in his time. So I went to the court and removed him from my ROI‚Äôs (release of information) and got someone to go to his storage unit and pick up everything of mine from him. 

AITA for doing this?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not getting my girlfriend a birthday cake at midnight?,56,2025-03-31 16:09:30,91,"I (24M) am wondering if I'm the asshole for not having a birthday cake ready at midnight for my girlfriend (27F). We've been together for a year and a half.

For context, we were out celebrating a festival at a friend's place and came back around midnight on her birthday. When we got home, she started crying because I didn't have a cake ready for her. The thing is, we had multiple conversations before her birthday where I specifically asked what kind of cake she wanted, but she dismissed the idea each time, saying she didn't need one. She claims that she had told others not to get her a cake because she expected one from me specifically. I apparently didn't listen to what she was actually saying, so there seems to be some miscommunication there, but I honestly don't remember her making that distinction.

After she got upset, we had a huge fight last night. The next morning, I went out early and got her a cake, breakfast, and flowers as a way to make it up to her, but she wanted to leave and go back to her own place.

This isn't the first time something like this has happened. It's a pattern where she becomes inconsolable over what I consider to be small mistakes from my end. When she gets upset, she cries and says things like I don't love her, I don't do enough for her, and that all I do is damage control after messing up.

I used to go the extra mile for her by quite a bit, but I've been toning it down a little lately - though not to the point where it's non-existent. I still get very thoughtful presents and try to do both little and big things for her. Part of the reason is that I'm currently in the middle of a job hunt (so is she), and I haven't been in the frame of mind to go out and do a lot of stuff.

I usually put a lot of thought into gifts for her, but when she's upset, she acts like I never do anything for her. The worst part is that it's usually something small that sets her off, and then there's no making it up to her. She'll get extremely upset as if I've done something terrible, followed by constant guilt-tripping.

This whole dynamic gives me a lot of anxiety because I never know what might trigger her next emotional explosion, and she seems constantly anxious that I don't love her or will leave her.

Today is actually her birthday, and I don't know what I can do now since she said she's inconsolable and prefers to be alone, which is what she told me before she left.

AITA for not having the cake at midnight when she previously said she didn't want one? And more broadly, AITA for finding this pattern of behavior exhausting?

**Note:**¬†I would appreciate if nobody suggested anything drastic. Nobody's perfect. I do love her very much, and I would rather get better at dealing with these situations. I'm not perfect, nor is she, and I'm perfectly fine with that."
amitheasshole,AITA for reporting my friend for alcohol abuse?,0,2025-04-01 19:42:23,15,"Throwaway for anonymity‚Äî

This is a weird one. My friend (19F) and I (18F) go to different universities that are several hundred miles apart, but we‚Äôve tried to stay in touch and meet up over breaks since we‚Äôve know each other for 8 years and value our friendship a lot. Anyway, the past few months, we had kind of fallen out of touch. She wouldn‚Äôt really reply to my messages and I had enough going on with school so I stopped trying to reach out as much, assuming she was simply busy or wanted space.

Another mutual friend of ours (19F), who also goes to a different university, called me recently and said she was really worried about our friend (I‚Äôll call her A) because A had frequently been drunk calling people and had even ended up in the hospital due to alcohol poisoning pretty recently. I asked if anything was being done to support A and help her find healthier ways to manage her stress, and my friend said that A was meeting with a therapist but that her parents didn‚Äôt know about the drinking and it was starting to affect her grades and such.

As someone who has experienced alcohol dependency in the past, I know how deep the hole is. Rock bottom has a basement. You don‚Äôt know it until you‚Äôre in it and you have no way out. I was really worried about A, and I suggested reaching out to her university‚Äôs alcohol/substance abuse care team to tell them what was going on. The purpose of the support team is just to reach out to impacted students and offer them resources (think AA student groups, group therapy, healthier coping mechanisms, etc). My university offers something similar.

I hated the thought of bringing more people into it or hurting A somehow, but being so far away, I truly am worried sick over her and know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything if something were to happen to her as a result of her drinking so much. That‚Äôs why I pitched the idea. My friend seemed on board with the idea, but when I let her know that I had called the support team the other day just to ask them to check on A and offer her resources, my friend lashed out, saying it wasn‚Äôt my place to get involved.

Now I‚Äôm questioning my choice. I love A dearly, even if we don‚Äôt see each other as often as we did in high school. I will always want the best for her, and I‚Äôd hate to see her lose herself to addiction. It‚Äôs a rocky hill and a tough battle to fight, and I just wanted to get her help before things got worse. So am I the asshole in this situation?"
amitheasshole,AITA: I got mad at my step father for smoking weed outside of our house,0,2025-04-02 00:51:10,48,"Here is a little bit of context:
I (14 M) have 3 sisters (4, 10, 15). We live in the suburbs so we don‚Äôt have a lot of land for our backyard. There are a lot of kids that live on our street and because we have a trampoline, they all come to our house and we are very welcoming about it. My STEP dad (47) picked up a habit of smoking weed and my mother (41) doesn‚Äôt try to stop his addiction. 
The way our backyard is set up, the shed in right behind the trampoline leaving about a foot or two of space between it and the trampoline where all of the kids play. My STEP dad uses the shed as a hot box to smoke his weed in. Although he says he doesn‚Äôt do it while the kids are playing outside it still releases second hand smoke from being around the shed and because it is so close to where they play it‚Äôs dangerous.
My mother hasn‚Äôt seemed to take any concern whatsoever which is irresponsible. For me to understand how dangerous that is compared to her utter cluelessness or just lack of care is a lot for a 14 year old to carry by themselves. A few minutes ago I walked out onto the porch to ask my mother something and guess what‚Ä¶MY STEP DAD WAS SMOKING WEED ON THE PORCH. We all use the porch in the mornings to get to school. Second hand smoke comes in through the cracks of the window in the living room. It‚Äôs not fair that we have to suffer the consequences of HIS actions because my mom refuses to do anything. If I can I will include screenshots.
I really need some help about this situation.

Something I failed to mention that keeps being brought up is the fact that I have no one else to live with, my bio dad passed away. He also smokes cigarettes and vapes inside the house from time to time"

amitheasshole,AITA or am I just a bad friend?,2,2025-04-01 09:25:31,12,"AITA or am I just a bad friend

My friend, who is 16, and I, who am 18, have been friends for over three years now, soon to be four! 
However, there has always been one incident that comes up few weeks. He and I met three years back when he had shifted to my apartment complex, and, we just clicked with each other. It was the deepest I had bonded with someone back then. Over a month, we became best friends. He meant a lot to me, but I always knew that we would have to part ways as he had only come because of his dad‚Äôs transfer to my city. I was afraid that he and I wouldn‚Äôt ever meet again. 

Eventually his dad got another transfer, and he had to leave. I was overcome with loss and grief. For the first few days, I just couldn‚Äôt get my mind off him not being there. I was truly engulfed by depressive thoughts. I wanted to move on, and I couldn‚Äôt keep moping over him, so surely not texting him would be the right move, right? How can you be attached to a person you no longer talk? In hindsight, my reasoning was wrong, but it was a decision I had to make. From then, I started dry texting him, leaving him on seen, and not responding to his texts. It wasn‚Äôt working; he persisted. After weeks of him trying to maintain a connection and me trying to sever it, I took the extreme step. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with him and that I found new friends since he left. I lied, and he still sent texts, but not as frequent. I almost believed that he didn‚Äôt care either, and I resolved to not befriend him ever again.

Months later, I went to a mutual friend‚Äôs party, to whom he had remarked that he was glad that he left. That made the realisation hit.  I hadn‚Äôt moved on. All I had done was cast aside the one friend who cared for me relentlessly, at my worst and at my best. I had lost the one real thing I had. I missed him, terribly. So, I tried to rebuild our friendship. It was more than merely successful. In less than a month, we had built a friendship deeper and stronger than it was last time. I hadn‚Äôt told him how I felt, and I made it a point to always put it across the board so he always knew that I cared for him. He did too. But we never discussed at length the months-long stretch where we hadn‚Äôt talked or texted, that was until a recent group call. 


He, I, and our friend got onto a group call, and she narrated how he acted during the time where he and I hadn‚Äôt uttered a word to each other. She told me how he was saddened and how he was frustrated, frustrated enough to use my name as an insult for icing people out. Weirdly enough, I was pleased. We talked later, of course, and he revealed to me that he was more so mad that he had to put in effort while I didn‚Äôt. We made up and kept talking. Soon, I noticed how he wouldn‚Äôt ever tell me how he felt about anything that happened in his life. I couldn‚Äôt help but be bothered by it. I always tell him how I feel, but he doesn‚Äôt. I think it has to do with me not talking to him for those long months. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA or has being a 'picky eater' lost all meaning?,3308,2025-03-30 16:56:58,499,"I don't consider myself to be a particularly picky eater. Human, sure. There are foods that I don't like. I'll even admit that outside of shrimp and crab, seafood is a no go for me. I've never been able to stomach fish. No, they way you make it isn't going to be an exception. Yes, that type of fish you claim doesn't taste fishy absolutely does. I also have fairly delicate American sensibilities when it comes to organ meat, but I can be talked into trying it. 

My (27f) boyfriend (31m) disagrees with me. To hear him describe my food habits, you'd think I was a dino nugget and mac n cheese girlie because of two things. The first is that I don't cook super spicy food at home (the operative word being cook. I like spicy food). The second being that I won't order sushi when it's his turn to pick where we eat out. He wants to be able to order a bunch of different rolls and share.

All of this has come up twice this week somehow. On Wednesday I made a simple pasta dish that pissed him off for some reason. It was just penne with jarred marinara and mushrooms I sauteed in butter and garlic before going in the sauce. It was served with roasted asparagus and store bought garlic knots on the side. It wasn't the most exciting meal. It was also the middle of the week, and I just wanted to eat. Queue the grumbling and the pulling out multiple bottles of hot sauce from his collection. Cool, douse it in Dr. Donkey's Atomic Ass Ripper Psycho Sauce if you want to. Don't sit and bitch about it the entire meal, please. Which he did. 

Yesterday is what really pissed me off. He wanted to go out for sushi. Normally I'm okay with that because most places have things I'll eat like tempura, miso soup, some kind of noodle dish, etc. Except he found a new place that's supposed to be great with a very streamlined menu that's almost entirely sushi. I like miso soup, but it's not dinner. I could order a non-fish roll, but I don't love the taste of nori, and I just wasn't in the mood to pay for the pleasure of eating something I don't enjoy. This started a huge argument about how picky I am. Seeing as how my counter offer for where to go was either Indian or kbbq, I just don't see. 

Ironically, I think he's pickier than I am. He won't eat anything made in a crockpot because of the texture. Absolutely no soup. He doesn't like most fruits unless we're talking about strawberry milkshakes. He acts like me eating olives is a war crime, and don't you dare suggest something with cabbage, kale, bell peppers, or any type of bean in it. And all of that is fine with me even if I'd love to be able to throw shit together in the crockpot before work for dinner. 

Am I off base here? I know seafood is a wide category that does limit things. I could have sucked it up and forced down a tempura roll. I can try to cook spicer at home to appease him a couple nights a week because as I said, I like spicy food. It's just frustrating to be accused of being so picky when I feel like I'm not. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for bringing things from my parents' estate home when my wife doesn't want them?,0,2025-04-01 16:27:52,11,"For over a year, I've (m43) been the main support for my parents (76), managing their rapid health decline. They've moved from a large suburban home in a different state to an apartment near me, and then to two memory care facilities. This week, we fully cleared out their apartment. This has been emotionally exhausting, and I'm bearing the brunt of it. My mom was a hoarder, making the downsizing process immense and overwhelming, My sister(46) lives in Germany, dealing with her own complex life, and my extended family is largely absent, leaving me to handle the logistics and emotional weight of the day-to-day alone.

I've brought home approximately 5% of their belongings: items with sentimental value; potentially useful items; and things we'd likely buy anyway (I'm only firm on the sentimental ones). Only about six items are larger than a banker's box (the largest is an 8ft tall shelf my dad designed and built).

My wife's (42) issues are twofold:

* She immediately criticizes the items, often calling them ""ugly‚Äù which feels incredibly hurtful during an already difficult emotional period.
* She dismisses almost all the items outright, showing little to no regard for my interest. She views them as simply ""stuff"" adding to our already cluttered home.

I understand her concern about clutter, especially with our 2-year-old. I acknowledge that I lean towards keeping things more than she does. However, I view this as a gradual and necessary process, not a sudden influx of junk. She feels I'm disregarding her need for our home to be a peaceful sanctuary, and that my attachment to these items is clouding my judgment. I'm trying to preserve meaningful pieces of my childhood and parents' lives, but she sees most items from their home as unwelcome clutter.

My wife lost her mother at 27, so she understands grief. However, she had significantly more family support than I do and didn't have to manage an entire estate. I feel she lacks empathy for the sheer magnitude of the burden I'm carrying. I also understand her perspective, that a home should be peaceful, and that bringing in items from a hoarding environment can be seen as inherently negative. Due to my role with my parents, she is also taking on the larger role with our toddler, increasing her stress.

We had a really bad argument over a desk lamp I brought home 2 days ago. It's the only lamp I wanted. She immediately called it ""ugly,"" said plugging it in was an ""aggressive affront,"" and threatened to throw it out. She backed down, but now we fight about everything. She thinks I'm making this harder than necessary, that it's ""just stuff,"" and that we don't need more things. I feel emotionally exhausted and need time and space to process, while she wants immediate decluttering and a veto of anything coming from my parents. I feel like we are living in two different realities, and she has no room for my reality.

AITA for keeping irreplaceable items (at least for now) that I'm attached to, when the alternative is donate or trash?"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my roommate to stop cooking fish at home?,5,2025-04-01 01:06:56,87,"I (25F) asked my roommate (26M) to stop cooking fish at home. It has gotten out of hand. To the point where our entire house is saturated with salmon aroma for days after. It‚Äôs important to note that my roommate and I are very good friends and have zero other living issues, but this one. 

We‚Äôve been living together for a year now and it‚Äôs gotten to a point where salmon specifically is his main source of protein. He buys it in bulk and regularly cooks it in the oven and microwaves it on a weekly basis. As you can imagine, our home smells like a fish market. I, personally, cannot stand the smell of fish. However, if he was cooking fish even once to twice a week - I‚Äôd have no issues. We are after all roommates not committed partners. 

Now we rise to the AITA in this situation. I started slowly making comments about the smell to drop a hint to which he laughs and will say ‚Äúdo you want me to starve?‚Äù. Yet, one year later and I still live in a fish market. I can‚Äôt take it any longer and told him to please stop cooking and microwaving fish on a consistent weekly basis. He argued that me asking him to stop eating fish isn‚Äôt fair especially since it‚Äôs his favorite food. From this conversation, he argued that he even microwaves his leftover fish at work and no one complains (I was sure to let him know that he is the talk of the office because it‚Äôs a cardinal rule to never microwave fish at work). 

Now I may be the AH because I‚Äôm trying to dictate what he can and cannot eat. So AITA for asking my roommate to stop cooking and microwaving fish at home so frequently?"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I took my kitchen supplies away without telling my roommate?,45,2025-03-31 15:39:24,23,"I (24f) have been living with a girl the same age as me since october last year. We do not get along. We only say the polite hi and that's about it. I think it started because she would live the kitchen dirty and I told her I was no longer going to clean after her, so we stopped talking lol. Anyways, she's not the dirtiest roommate, just very inconsiderate. 

It's the classics: leaves pots and pans dirty for weeks, leaves the stove and countertops dirty, spills food on the cabinets and floors, etc. She also doesn't follow the cleaning schedule SHE made, which means she takes the trash out once a month after I've put it by the door, cleans the bathroom when she feels like it and rarely cleans the floors. We agreed to do that every week btw, taking turns of course. And when I clean, she leaves it dirty almost immediatly. She has also stolen some utensils of mine and when I asked her about it, she said she ""brought some from home too"" which made no sense? And she always prefers to use mine anyway.

I think I had my breaking point yesterday since I came home exhausted after being away for a few days and ready to clean the bathroom, only to find period blood on the toilet seat. Kitchen was dirty as usual. Utensils were missing or had food residue in them. I gotta admit, I have not communicated enough. However, we almost never cross each other paths. I only told her about please leaving the kitchen clean after cooking (which she doesn't do still), to please follow her cleaning schedule (which she still doesn't do) and to return my cookware (which she still hasn't done).  I used to live in the dorms with 15 other people and had so much more peace knowing my stuff was clean and in my room. So I feel like that would relieve the stress. However, I do no want to talk to her anymore. She is 24 and not a child. I know this is a rash decision and would make things harder, but what's the point of trying to speak with her again? She won't change. I know I'm acting childlish myself, but WIBTA?

amitheasshole,AITA for sending my ex a dramatic april fools text?,0,2025-04-01 21:33:36,32,"So today I woke up feeling foolish and sent the following text to many of my friends and two of my exes who I still considered to be on friendly terms with:

‚ÄúI need to ask you something and I want you to be totally honest with me. It might be awkward with us after this, but I have to know how you feel. I have kept this in for a long while and its about time I was straight up and just confronted you about it. I hope this doesn't ruin the relationship we already have. I just need to know and I can't see any other way to get over this. It just doesn't seem fair on me if I don't get an answer. I want you to tell me truthfully no matter what it is. I just want your honest opinion... Do you know the muffin man?‚Äù

I usually am the friend who sends out copypasta holiday texts to people who respond well and seem to enjoy them which did include my most recent ex. For some context, we dated about 7 months total and the last 3 months were long distance due to me relocating for a new job several states away. I did initiate the breakup after realizing he seemed to feel more strongly about me than I could reciprocate at the time and just feeling like I wasn‚Äôt going to get there since we had switched to long distance. I definitely feel like an asshole but it was a genuine attempt to give him a laugh for the day and my friends all have biased feedback in my favor since they know me and my goofy nature. They also expect these antics when it‚Äôs a holiday and usually aren‚Äôt fooled by me. Obviously it was a mistake to send it and I did apologize when he told me how it made it him feel without making any excuses but I want to see if a neutral audience thinks this was an AH move?

I certainly won‚Äôt be sending any to him again and likely won‚Äôt plan to contact him so any further contact can be on his terms but my previous ex of 7 years laughed it off and I think I am just a little thrown since I am used to being on friendly terms with my exes when things don‚Äôt end because of toxicity or in a disrespectful way."

We both had our own best friends, and we all used to hang out as a group of four. Over time, A started acting distant, sometimes walking away sadly or not talking to us. I introduced her to some of my other friends, and she got closer to them,to the point where she started sitting with them instead of me.

One day at lunch, I couldn‚Äôt find A and her best friend, so I sat with a different group. Later, A acted upset, and I found out she had been complaining that I was leaving her out. When she confronted me about it, I lost my patience and told her I had other friendships to maintain. She teared up, but I walked away.

Afterward, I heard from multiple people (including some from the ‚Äúsecluded‚Äù friend group she was trying to join) that A had been talking badly about me. When she later tried to apologize, I didn‚Äôt accept it because I felt she wasn‚Äôt truly sorry, just caught. This led to a huge argument in the changing rooms, where we both shouted at each other, and I told her I hated her.

Over the next few days, she kept trying to talk to me, but I ignored her. She even waited for me outside class and tried knocking on my cubicle. She eventually started crying and going to the nurse frequently. When we were forced to talk by a teacher, I told her I needed time, but she didn‚Äôt seem to accept that. Meanwhile, she started forcing herself into the secluded friend group, making some of them uncomfortable.

Then, I heard that she was spreading more rumors, calling her own best friend ‚Äútwo-faced‚Äù and saying I was a bad influence. She also twisted things I had said about another girl, making it seem like I called her manipulative. My best friend, who was there at the time, confirmed I never said that.

To make things worse, her best friend,who had always supported her,finally saw her true colors when A publicly called her a liar. I posted about the situation on my close friends‚Äô story to stop the rumors, but A found out and started asking people about it.

At this point, I feel like we were both in the wrong, but she refuses to take any responsibility. So, AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling a girl I‚Äôm not taking her to prom?,214,2025-03-31 04:54:52,51,"So idk if it‚Äôs like this everywhere but only juniors and seniors can go to prom by themselves, if a freshman and Junior want to go they have to have an upperclassman.

This year I‚Äôm a junior and so I can go by myself. A girl, who is a sophomore, I‚Äôm not exactly close with asked me multiple times throughout the year if she could go with me and I have said no every single time. Well the other day I was talking about it to my best friend (a Junior) and said that ‚Äúwe should get tickets together because it‚Äôll be cheaper‚Äù and the girl buts in and goes ‚Äúwhen are you getting your ticket‚Äù, I was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, why?‚Äù. Well she goes, ‚ÄúI have my money, when do you want me to give it to you?‚Äù.

Which I feel like is a kinda wtf thing cuz I‚Äôve said I‚Äôm not taking you. And mind you she‚Äôs the type of girl who complains about everything then gloats about how good she is at everything, it‚Äôs exhausting. She does insults (at everyone but me, anything I say she has to agree and if I call her out on insults she‚Äôll apologize). And last thing she knew me and my friend were gonna take two graduates that we‚Äôre close with to prom (that didn‚Äôt work out).

And the whole thing is her brother (who is an upper class man) cannot take her.

I don‚Äôt remember what I said to her but then she was like ‚Äúwell my mom is gonna make me go to prom‚Äù. I said, ‚Äúwhat is she gonna do, come up to the school and go ‚ÄòMy baby needs to go to prom!‚Äô, which no one would put past her.

it ended up with her saying ‚Äúwell, my mom already bought my flowers‚Äù, I told her ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my problem when I, and others, have already told you no‚Äù, and in my mind it was like ‚Äòthat‚Äôs a shitty thing to say‚Äô and then when I talked to my mom she was like ‚Äúshe could be lying‚Äù and I proceeded to be like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs still messed up??‚Äù. And she did it in a pouty, sulky way.

Well it ended with her being like ‚Äúmy mom will probably make my brother take me‚Äù, I thought the ENTIRE reason you‚Äôve been asking is because he couldn‚Äôt take you???

Anyways, AITA?

Edit: idk how true it is, it could be my friends messing with me BUT if you get tickets with an underclass you have to show up together. That would put me and my friends on a weird schedule. My mom says it‚Äôs not that big of a deal but I don‚Äôt want to sit there and wait on her for anything. And my mom says I should just do it since she‚Äôs buying her own ticket.

Edit2: I know it‚Äôs not an excuse but she was also homeschooled until like 7th grade or something, so on the irl behalf it shows.

Edit3: we‚Äôre both girls 

Edit4: Supposedly her mother texted a seniors mother when the girl was a freshman and asked her to have her son take the girl to prom. 4 yr age gap. And my school does require for the upperclassmen and the under to show up together."
amitheasshole,AITA for leaving early and probably selling the car for less value,0,2025-04-01 09:22:37,14,"Situation is the following. I meet two friends while doing an work holiday year in a different country. We worked together and lived in the same hostel and bought a car together. The plan was the two guys leave at the end of march and I stay in the country till early May. We all payed the same price for the car and used it to make a 4 month road-trip throughout the country. 

Afterwards the guys left and I stayed behind to work and sell the car till I leave as well. We wanted to sell the car for nearly the same price we bought it at, as we did some repairs and put some more money in it. After no one wanted to buy the car and we had it online for nearly two weeks we went lower with the price. 

Now came the problem. I didn‚Äôt find any work so I‚Äôm probably gonna leave three weeks earlier and have to sell the car off for a way lower price. We started selling it for 3k and then went down to 2800 then to 2500 and are now down to 2300 (the car was online for over a month by this point). If no one is buying the car till the end of the week I probably have to sell it to a dealership and they will pay even less than 2300. 

Now I told my friends that I plan on leaving early and to word it kindly they snapped. Told me it‚Äôs not their fault I don‚Äôt get a job and I‚Äôm an egoistic asshole for now wanting to sell the car off to a dealership and stuff. One even told me that I would have to pay the difference to him if I sell it off for way cheaper. 

For once I can understand their anger, we all payed for it and it‚Äôs shitty that I want to leave early and sell the car for cheaper than we thought. On the other hand I don‚Äôt understand what another three weeks would do if we‚Äôve been trying to sell it for over a month now to no avail. It‚Äôs not my fault the cars not selling and I loose money as well by selling it off for that cheap. I mean that‚Äôs what I would have to do anyway if it hasn‚Äôt been sold by the end of April. 

Could you guys give your ten cents and tell me that I‚Äôm wrong/right.

**tldr; bought a car with two friends, two friends left country while I was supposed to stay for another month behind. Now I‚Äôm leaving three weeks earlier and having to sell car off for cheaper than anticipated** "
amitheasshole,"AITA for being frustrated that my roommate last minute said ""uhm I don't want anyone to drink to night"" and then angrily went to his room?",2860,2025-03-30 14:10:02,539,"So I have a roommate who doesn't like alcohol much, which is fine I'm not peer pressuring him to drink or whatever. What frustrated me though is that he pushes his discomfort for alcohol on everyone else. Yesterday, my other roommates and I planned that we would have vodka crans and watch a movie. After I asked my other roommate (who would be drinking) if they would like one now, this one says ""uhm, actually I've been around alcohol all day and I don't really want to smell or be around it at all."" This disappointed me and frustrated me, cause everyone else had planned this out and were ready. It's not like we were getting blackout drunk either, just a couple drinks and a movie. Originally, I was going to oblige, but I did say under my breath something like ""well, if it bothers you, you can go to you room and vibe there."" I don't know if he heard me, but he got up then and stormed to his room. He works at a bar and grill, so in terms of the smell and being around it all day, I don't know what he expected. Later, he come out to use the restroom and just said ""next time, warn me please,"" followed by assuming that we weren't going to oblige him at all by saying ""well earlier, you all weren't really listening to me.""

amitheasshole,AITA for fighting and cancelling plans because of my family's different opinions?,0,2025-04-01 12:38:48,29,"I(21f) am from India. And well apparently here we believe that the sick shouldn't know that they are sick because that will kill them before the illness will.

My mother's uncle has cancer, 4th stage and he's like really sick. But no one has told him that he has cancer. So I asked my mother why does he not know? Like he deserves to know why he is so sick right?

My mother behaved awfully rude because we have had this conversation before. So I told her that he still has the right to know. Like if I was sick I would want to know why my health is deteriorating.

Things went downhill when my father joined in and he said that if he ever gets cancer, I shouldn't tell him because that would be the only thing he will think about.

So I said ok that's your opinion, it's fine but you don't know if that's the uncle's opinion also. He told me that I have become too all knowing and I argue too much.

The only thing I could do was cry because of their behaviour for a single opinion of mine. We got into a very bad fight and I cancelled our plans with family friends. Which caused another chaos and my family is still telling me that I am wrong for having such an opinion and I am trying to kill her uncle by giving him news about his cancer. 

I feel guilty now and shouldn't have acted the way I did. Pulling down his moral wasn't my intention. 


So am I the asshole for cancelling our plans and fighting? "
amitheasshole,AITA? For not defending my sister at Subway,1,2025-04-01 04:56:48,7,"In order to understand the story you need to know that I am a very shy girl. I don‚Äôt talk back to older people or people I respect even though they might be in the wrong. I grew up to be like that but my sister on the other hand said whatever is on her mind to anyone not holding back.  Today I (18F) , my sister (16F), cousin (17F) and my aunt (51F) everyone in this story is Hispanic. Went to our local grocery store. When I mean local grocery store it means I can walk from my house to the store in under 10 mins. None of us own a car to drive to the store so we needed to walk it. My cousin and aunt own a wagon for groceries so we brought it with us instead of holding all the bags. The grocery shopping went fine. My sister and cousin were craving Subway so we went into Subway next to the grocery store with the wagon that had some food, about 10  items like bolillos(bread), some sodas, etc. Immediately we came in with the wagon the workers saw. My cousin and I ordered subs.  The workers were speaking Spanish so we ordered in Spanish as well. The workers saw the bread (bolillos) and started to make jokes about taking the bread and making it into a sub. Rough translating as I forgot what they exactly said ‚Äú I can take that bread and add hams and cheese to it if you want that‚Äù and he ask his coworker ‚Äúhey can we take those bread and make it into a sub‚Äù he responds with ‚Äú yeah we can make them into salvadoran bolillos.‚Äù They stopped with the joke and he did the regular things as a subway worker does. Like asking me if I want the sub toasted stuff like that. Mind you, none was laughing, only them. My aunt has bad hearing so she was kinda listening and not but my sister wasn‚Äôt listening at all. At this point we‚Äôre at the cashier. I told him to add my cousin's sub to mine as well because we decided to share a six foot long sub together(we got 2). My sister gets up and says my name ‚Äú hey am going to pay‚Äù He asks me ‚Äú are you going to pay or the fat girl‚Äù I was in shock I didn‚Äôt know what to say I stayed silent and I said ‚Äú she going to pay‚Äù I felt so uncomfortable that I left the cashier and went to the table we‚Äôre going to eat food and let my sister take over for me. I didn‚Äôt say anything about what happened during the time we were eating. I didn‚Äôt say anything in that 5 min walk even though I was thinking about it. I didn‚Äôt say anything to anyone when we were organizing the food into its place. I said something 2~3 hours later. 

When I told my family what happened, they were mad at me. 
For not speaking up and defending my sister 
For bringing it up
  My mom said because I wanted to make fun of my sister that‚Äôs why I told her. But I don‚Äôt think that was the case (I don‚Äôt know what I brought up, I think I told them because I wanted to bring light to the situation and I didn‚Äôt find time.
   My aunt and cousin said I shouldn‚Äôt say it 2-3 hours later. I should have said it in the moment so they could have said something. "
amitheasshole,AITA for trying to get out of my college graduation ceremony?,9,2025-03-31 19:38:05,26,"Hi everyone!! I feel a little lost on this situation, so I was hoping to get some clarity! I‚Äôm currently a senior in college at a large SEC University in the South. Our graduation ceremonies are HUGE! People typically get there around 5, for it to start around 7:30, and not end until after 10 or 11. It sounds insane, and really overstimulating.. I‚Äôm a girl with a milder form of autism, and can usually mask my symptoms, unless it comes to a huge event that is extremely stressful, and huge crowds. 

I suggested to my family that we celebrate in my college town instead, grabbing dinner and drinks, and then after the ceremony going to do the ‚Äútraditions‚Äù that most graduates like to do around our college campus. My family called me selfish, and essentially shut down the idea immediately, saying that I would regret not going. The following day, my mother also immediately ordered my graduation dress, so that I would feel like I needed to go. During my high school ceremony, I got extremely stressed, and ended the night with a migraine, and had to go home immediately after the ceremony. I hated every second of it.

It‚Äôs considered ‚Äúiconic‚Äù for families around our state to attend this school‚Äôs graduation ceremony, and my parents really wanna go, but I know that I wouldn‚Äôt really enjoy it. We also have assigned seating, so I would be stuck, bored for the extent of the ceremony.. I‚Äôm also going to Graduate school here starting in the fall, so if I wanted to I could attend that ceremony in two years.. I know that this is a first world problem, but I essentially told my family how I feel, and they don‚Äôt care. So I‚Äôm not really sure what to do.

I‚Äôm so sorry, I know that was a lot of information.. but essentially, AITA for not wanting to attend my college ceremony?

amitheasshole,AITA for not giving my ex-husband enough time to buy our marital home?,1399,2025-03-30 16:59:14,94,"In short first. English is not my first language, so bear with me.

So, me (31,F) and my ex (30,M) were married couple of years and we divorced in 2021. Divorce was messy and I shall tell you more about it later, but we got our assets divided, except for our shared home and a car. My ex, whom I shall refer as John, wanted to buy our shared home and car to himself. And I was fine with it. I just wanted to get rid of everything that was our shared property.

I moved to a rental unit and began to wait. First he said it will be a couple of moths, then half a year, then a year and so on. He told me he was saving money, his money situation was hard etc. And I just gave him time. John needed to save approximately 4000-6000‚Ç¨ to get the loan. And I believed that he could save that pretty quickly. But then started the waterworks, he got laid off, he was burnt out and so on. Although, through all of this, he had money to visit abroad and buy almost a brand new motorbike.

Midst all this, he wanted me to pay for the house renovations, upgrades he got for the house and he tried to get me to pay for some electric renovations. I declined of any payments, because I didn't benefit for the renovations (he said the house would still be sold to him at the same price) and I didn't even get any rent from him staying there. I also didn't pay the mortgage, because he was living in the house rent-free.

Now, four years have passed and still nothing. Same songs. He lost all the money (and said that was the new American presidents fault) and didn't have anything. He needed more time. I said I've had enough and I threatened legal actions and found myself a lawyer. He tried to settle thing, but no answer. Now John was mad that I made him ask for a bank loan or possibly take him from his home. Because the settlement didn't work, we are going to court with this. And with that, either he buys the house and the car, or he moves and sells it all.

So, AITA for only waiting four years and not giving him enough time to save approximately 5000‚Ç¨?"
amitheasshole,AITA? My mom wants me to take my little sister to my senior prom,281,2025-03-31 01:42:16,153,"Background: My sister is in the ninth grade at a private school. She is at a private school because she just wasn‚Äôt doing well in public school. She‚Äôs going to be there all four years, and they don‚Äôt have a prom.

So my mom said she wanted me to take my sister to my senior prom. I told her she wouldn‚Äôt know anyone and it wouldn‚Äôt be very fun for her. My mom just told me that she‚Äôll know me, and I better stick with her and not go off anywhere without her. But it‚Äôs my *senior* prom. It‚Äôs not just any old dance. I don‚Äôt want to have to look after my sister the whole night. And I don‚Äôt think my friends will really want a 14 year old around the whole time either. We‚Äôre all 17 and 18. I‚Äôm afraid no one will want to hang out with us.

Even though my sister won‚Äôt have a prom, I don‚Äôt think this will make up for it. She won‚Äôt know anybody, and her friends certainly won‚Äôt be there. She‚Äôll also be 14 at a dance with 16, 17, and 18 year olds. I don‚Äôt know. Am I being petty?"
amitheasshole,AITA for sending my kids to their dad instead of implement his decisions myself?,8157,2025-03-30 08:06:46,404,"Hi all, my husband and I are recently separated and heading for a divorce. We have three children, 2 together and one that he brought into the marriage and they are all mostly staying with me. 
 
Our kids and I have all been going for MMA classes once a week for about a year before the separation and I think it was great.  We were having fun, it was great bonding, great exercise and especially for me and the girls a great way to increase our confidence. 
As part of our separation agreement, dad insisted that the kids stop MMA, because it's ""too aggressive"" and he doesn't want them to ""turn out like"" me. I agreed to stop taking them, because there were surely bigger things at stake and I didn't feel like that should be my hill to die on.  I tried to gently explain to the kids that we are not going to do MMA anymore and to pick a different activity.

Still, I didn't really know how to explain why, without blaming their dad or without claiming something I absolutely don't believe and can't defend (MMA will make them aggressive), sooo I send them to dad whenever they ask.  And most especially our middle child on the spectrum asks about it a lot (she asks to go every single week and usually cries when I say no).

Now my husband is mad at me that I keep sending the kids to him whenever they ask about going for MMA again or about why we stopped instead of just implementing ""our decision"". 

Am I the asshole here? I'm not badmouthing him or anything. Just when a kid asks to go I tell them ""ooh let's ask daddy about it. Let's call him right now"". Or something along those lines

amitheasshole,AITA for asking my roommate to leave the room to give me one full night with my girlfriend every week?,0,2025-04-01 20:09:00,61,"I (20F) share a dorm with my roommate, Sof (20F). We were also very close friends.
I started dating my gf, C, early this semester and Sof started seeing this girl, F, 3 weeks ago. Early in the semester, I asked Sof what limits she wanted for C staying over. She said 3 nights a week max. So, I suggested that I alternate weekends, one weekend at C‚Äôs and the next weekend C would spend at mine. Sof agreed and we followed that.

I sleep over at C‚Äôs on Mon/Wed nights voluntarily. And now I leave the room on Saturday nights when Sof asks so she can have alone time w/ F. However, when C and I want alone time, Sof only leaves for 5 hours max. She claims she doesn‚Äôt need to leave any longer bc, unlike me, she doesn‚Äôt care abt being in the room when my gf is over.

Sof has never asked me to leave for a full night, she only asks for a couple of hours. I choose to stay out the whole night bc I don‚Äôt want to third-wheel + I have history with F (we talked for a couple weeks last semester, then mutually ghosted each other), which makes it awkward. Meanwhile, Sof is fine being in the room when C is over, so she chooses to come back earlier.
I asked if she could stay at F‚Äôs one night of the weekend to even things out since I always leave on Saturdays for her. She refused, saying she‚Äôs not comfy staying at F‚Äôs overnight and that I already sleep over at C‚Äôs voluntarily, so it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt count‚Äù as her getting an extra night. She is allowed to stay at F‚Äôs, just doesn‚Äôt prefer to. 

Sof and I argued about all of this over text, and she told me we have different values in friendship and that we should just be roommates, not friends. She said she‚Äôd try to stay at F‚Äôs once a week but only to avoid arguing, not because she actually agrees with me (her words).

Important Info:
- Sof set a rule at the beginning of the semester that C isn‚Äôt allowed to be in our room at all after school on Mon, Wed, Fri, except for rare occasions if I ask her permission first. I have accommodated this
- Sof inserts herself into any private convos me and C have in the room. I brought this up, and she dismissed it, saying she has the right to talk to anyone in her room. C called Sof earlier in the semester to talk about this issue, but Sof hasn‚Äôt changed.
- me and Sof‚Äôs room is significantly nicer than C's or F's rooms. We live in a hotel (don't ask) so there are queen sized beds, a large tv, and a private bathroom.
- I never asked Sof to leave for extended periods until now, because now she has somewhere else she can stay. C's roommate has nowhere else to stay, so we can't kick her out. F's roommate does sometimes spend nights elsewhere on weekends.

At this point, I feel like I‚Äôve accommodated her, but she won‚Äôt do the same. And it‚Äôs deeper than just a roommate dispute to me. I think, as my friend, she should get why I would want the room for a night and try and make it more even. 
(also if you're wondering why we need more than five hours please consult your local lesbian...)

We are so close I would even consider her to be my best friend. During 9th grade she changed schools and we didn‚Äôt text much (Thats my fault as I‚Äôm not the greatest and remembering to text or contact people), however since then we have gotten super close again and TMI no longer exists between us. Over the last few weeks maybe we even months, I‚Äôve noticed she hardly texts me unless I text her, but when we do text I make sure to ask if shes okay and if she needs help (She has had a pretty rough year with things I wont discuss). Our conversations aren‚Äôt dry and we have a good chat. I also ask her to hangout often as she is one of my only friends atm, but she says she‚Äôs swamped and stressed with schoolwork.

I texted her today about this observation and she hit me with the ‚ÄúIm super busy with school and im so stressed‚Äù again. I so desperately want to point out that I also have assignments that are due, I‚Äôve recently gotten out of an abusive relationship, am currently getting bullied constantly (I dont actually know the specific reason but am now isolated and hate school), my dads just been diagnosed with cancer (which she would know if she ever asked how I was going) yet I still manage to make an effort in our friendship, texting and checking in on her and offering to help.

amitheasshole,AITA for agreeing with my gf who called out my ex?,61,2025-03-31 08:10:47,67,"TL:DR my (29M) ex (27F) gives my gf (23F) attitude and my gf gives it right back. Ex comes to me thinking I should do something about it. AITA?

I broke up with my ex a little over a year ago. We were together for 4 years and it ended on bad terms. We worked for the same hospital, and after the breakup, work was understandably awkward. People took sides and decided I was the bad guy, but I think the person who does the breaking up is always painted that way. Plus, her dad is a super respected doctor and no one wants to get on his bad side. After about a month, she quit the job and started working somewhere else.

My gf also works with us, but not in the same department. I do still see her maybe 1-2 times a shift, depending on how busy it gets. A couple months later, I see my ex's name on the schedule again

Anyway, as soon as she came back, people treated me like the bad guy again. Whenever she was in the room, she wouldn't even look at me. She even pretended I didn't exist. People would still work with me, but no more casual talking because they would all go to wherever she was during the break which was always far away from me. I figured people are just being immature and it would blow over, but it's been a couple weeks now and nothing has changed.

Then, one day, she storms into my rig and tells me that my gf ""blew up"" at her when she was trying to help my gf. Allegedly my ex went to go ""help"" gf with a patient and instead of gf groveling with thanks, gf told my ex that ex coming back to this job made work difficult for me. Ex was screaming that she didn't want to come back, but her new job sucked and our boss offered her a job when they grabbed coffee to catch up. Apparently, they're friends. Likely, she had no one higher up like her dad or our boss to deal with how emotional she gets when people don't thank her for every little thing she did at her new job.

I asked my gf what happened and she says she needed help lifting a patient, but was looking for anyone else to help her. No one was available so ex barged in. My gf says she didn't say anything while with the pt, but as ex walked out ex said ""you're welcome"" with a snooty attitude which caused gf to defend me.

I think ex expected me to admonish my gf, but what gf said was true. Ex does make my life harder at work, and she's turned everyone against me. Ex should've stayed at her other job, but I guess it's easier to come back when your dad's a head honcho at the workplace. Now, people at work are telling me that me and my gf are major a-holes.They also accuse me of other stuff that's technically true but not actually true. If anything, I feel like ex wbta in this situation.

So here I am, coming to reddit to see if AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for choosing a wedding reception venue that my  best friend wants in the future.,1216,2025-03-30 15:35:50,288," My fianc√© and I chose our wedding reception venue about 10 days ago‚Äì a country club where we know several people who are members. While I‚Äôm not a member myself, they allow non-members to rent the space. A close friend of mine got married there last year and recommended it to me.

My best friend and her family have been members for at least 20 years, so I thought she would be happy for me when I mentioned the venue. I shared the news with two of my best friends (one being her) and casually mentioned, ‚ÄúHey, I found my wedding reception venue!‚Äù At that time, we only placed a soft hold on the venue but didn‚Äôt go into specifics with them.

Over the next few days, my best friend (who is not engaged yet) and I weren‚Äôt really in touch, and then I received a series of lengthy text messages from her on Saturday. She expressed that I ‚Äústole‚Äù her wedding venue and that I had gone behind her back. I was really caught off guard because she had never mentioned this venue as a possibility for her wedding, and I had told her about my intention 10 days ago. Additionally, she kept pointing out that I‚Äôm not a member of the country club, but she is.

I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do. I never intended to hurt her feelings, and this situation has really thrown me off. I‚Äôm now wondering if I should‚Äôve had a more formal conversation with her about my plans to use this venue. 

We‚Äôve already signed paperwork for the venue, but there may still be an option to back out, although I‚Äôm uncertain. This whole situation has been really overwhelming for me, and it‚Äôs affected my mental health to the point where I had my first panic attack in a long time. Wedding planning has become so stressful, and I‚Äôm feeling lost. AITA 

TL/DR: We chose a wedding reception venue and my future maid of honor does not want us to have our reception at her country club. "

We were cool UNTIL my freshman year in collage.We would constantly fight over stuff like he saying am ignoring him(I was just busy all day but I text him between my lectures and I'm really trying) and he wasn't really giving me any attention EVEN if he was free because he doesn't go to his university (didn't drop out he just doesn't go). 
Note: my uni is far from home that I'd travel back every month . Keep in mind that he knew I was traveling and didn't text me to make sure that I'm okay even if he was mad.. One day I sent him a message apologizing for everything I have ever done and GUESS WHAT he started blaming me! Saying really mean things to me, I was really upset that all I said was you have hurt me and why would you say such mean things?(it was two voice notes and his tone was like he didn't care less about what he said and when I confronted him he said that he was. just telling me the way he felt)  He deleted it and simply said that he wanted to sleep, I wanted to wait and observe. After a day he messaged me ""so what?"" and I said what? do you have anything to say? He said no. And I was pissed, after TWO DAYS he texted again and send two OTHER voice notes blaming me and stuff so I simply said oh, I get it now and guess what he said.. He said FINALLY. And at that point I felt disgusted ,one week later I brought it up.. he explained ""why am I wrong"" I tried to do the same and he wasn't even giving me the space to express myself and I told him you better shut the f up or I'm going to hung up and won't talk to you again. I explained that I had collage, assignments, events, quizs, and I was stressed the f out I needed him and all he did is be mean to me, he cried and I couldn't be sad for it because he didn't know how bad I felt when I wanted to cry but couldn't because I have three other girls in my room (shared room). I told him that I felt alone and that I felt like I was trying to fix everything while he wasn't, and he was just playing on his pc, and wanting me to do everything. All he cared for is me providing things for him as attention and support.. I'm not his mom to provide all of that as well as my energy for nothing. He was trying to prove me wrong and make me appear like a villan so I sent him screenshots untill he started saying random stuff like that he got sad and didn't talk to me because I said he has hurt me and that his words were mean and awful. He actually blamed me for not having anything when he said the same and when he sent the other aweful record ,sorry but how could I talk to you when YOU are the one who messed up! He responded with you are older so I said ""Am I the man too?"" it got to the point where I couldn't argue anymore and had high blood pressure (it wasn't serious it would come from stress) anyways he apologized, told me that I don't deserve this and that I deserve better,I told him I agree with him and that I'll leave if this ever happened again since it meant that he didn't respect me, my feelings and my boundaries,told him that if it happened again I won't even listen, I'll leave immediately.Should I talk to his mother on the phone about the issue?  he is or was one of my good and best friends at some point because the rest were toxic and he helped a lot. I hope you get me! "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I kept some of my paternal inheritance,2,2025-03-31 23:38:43,3,"Despite being full siblings, my brother (33M) and I (30F) grew up separately. He was essentially abandoned by my mother who met a new husband while pregnant with me. He on the other hand was raised by our paternal grandfather whom in his later years required a caretaker. There was an unspoken agreement between all of my paternal family members that my brother would pay for the caretaker in exchange for getting to keep the house where his wife and new baby currently reside. I initially agreed for him to simply take over my portion of the house and he could have it. Of course that did not happen and due to foreign laws I do not know much of, his wife has had to put an offer on their home. As a result, I am to be paid out 1/8 of my share of the home. 

Our mother is adamant that I return all of it to them but in smaller increments over the course of years to avoid ‚Äúsuspicion.‚Äù This has me worrying that I am somehow participating in some illegal activity. I proposed then that I pay back the maximum allowed for this year and that her and my stepdad each pay back a bit as well and that they take it out of my half of the inheritance (which they have discussed previously). My mother has taken great offense to this stating I am not entitled to money from her and my stepdad and have no right to be discussing this with them. 

What bothers me the most through this is the hypocrisy and favoritism. While my mother did abandon my brother she always bemoaned my existence, wishing she had my brother with her instead. My basic medical needs such as dentist visits and glasses were treated as a huge burden despite them being quite wealthy. When I needed glasses in the first grade my stepfather said I looked like a frog and four-eyes and my mother told me i deserved the scolding. She also has always talked about how I‚Äôm the reason she couldn‚Äôt finish her PhD and had to settle for a master due to being pregnant with me. 

I feel the need to include this context because I feel that my entire childhood has been seen as a transaction and that I was costing them so much money and time. But now that my inheritance is up for grabs it‚Äôs unthinkable that I keep any money and that I‚Äôm suddenly greedy and desperate. 

Like most other people I really could use this money as I‚Äôm hoping to go back to school. I also realize that my brother is also a victim here which is why I‚Äôm not planning on keeping the whole 1/8. At the same time I‚Äôm somewhat bitter he‚Äôll get a portion of my mother and stepfather large inheritance despite not having to suffer their abuse and negligence while I am being told that I am not entitled to anything from my paternal or maternal sides.

amitheasshole,AITA for pointing out my black friend has white parents,0,2025-04-01 17:43:30,35,"I am from a small town with mostly only white people, so when I went off to college I was not the best at being subtle about my naivety to other races. This was mostly through things deemed taboo, such as asking questions about experiences and finding boundaries. I admit I am fairly naive, but when I became close friends with a black person I started to settle into an understanding. I am overly curious and it can come off as odd, though they would usually answer any questions I had such as asking about hair texture, sunburns, different lifestyles, etc. My friend actually disliked me at the beginning of our ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù, this went on for months but I found out they were bored because their actual best friend was busy at work. They admitted they knew I would just go along with anything they wanted to do, despite finding me annoying. After a couple months they said they started to actually like me and we became a lot closer. I was fine with this but also a little hurt, so we would joke about it. 

That's when the insults started coming as jokes, calling me stupid or naive as an insult. The main insulting joke they would use, with everyone not just me, was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre white‚Äù. Which I found funny at first, but then it started becoming genuinely unfair, they would justify saying mean things to me by saying I deserved it for being white. 

It boiled over when I was at their apartment, I was high out of my mind and they had nonstop insulted me. I don't remember all of the conversations but at one point they said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre white, I‚Äôm black‚Äù to justify another insult, to which I responded ‚ÄúRaised by white people‚Äù. At this point they told me my comment was racist, which I didn't mean it to be but I understand how they took it as that. I apologized and they continued saying I basically said they weren't black because they were adopted by white people. This wasn't my intention, hence why I apologized. 

Now, after 5 texts apologizing, they have refused to talk to me and removed me from all their posts as well as unfollowing me. AITA? I know what I said was bad but I felt justified in pointing out that they constantly say they hate white people, and yet the majority of their friends are white and their parents are white! I am aware it's a joke but after so many ‚Äújokes‚Äù I became upset and lashed out. I‚Äôm confused and upset and I know they're going to tell other people about what I said, twisting it to make it sound worse, I lost my only friend at college with zero communication.

edit: the only reason I brought it up was to point out that their parents are white, and questioning why they constantly say they hate white people despite having white parents

edit: I do feel horrible for saying it which is why I apologized multiple times in person and over text, to which they said it was okay but are now ghosting me

UPDATE AS OF THIS MORNING: She texted back and said ""Good morning. After thinking about it, we‚Äôve decided to stick with our original gift. üòä""

AITAH ‚Äî My MIL asked my DH if someone with a huge monster truck/SUV (not sure still) could come to our house and take my 6 year old son on a drive down the street (culdesac) the day after his birthday. He said ‚Äúshe researched and found a commercial sign shop and toured the facility and they seemed really nice and they have this truck they sometimes let people drive in for parties.‚Äù I asked who they were and I couldn‚Äôt find anything about this car service or a person even tied to the sign shop. All I have is a business card to the shop. AITAH for asking her who the person driving my son down the street is?

My husband thinks I‚Äôm being ‚Äúcontrolling.‚Äù I said, ‚Äúif my mom came to us with the same thing, tell me you wouldn‚Äôt feel the same way as I do?‚Äù His response, ‚ÄúYour Mom doesn‚Äôt do cool things, at least my mom is out there trying to do cool things.‚Äù

Also think it‚Äôs strange she only asked him and left me out of it. I texted her and asked who the driver is, and I haven‚Äôt heard back. "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if my sister (f31) and I (m21) got a sibling tattoo without telling or asking our brother (m30) if he also wants in.,7,2025-03-31 18:11:03,14,"So the situation:

I asked my sister if she wanted to get a matching tattoo, because she's really important to me and I know she doesn't have tattoos but likes the idea and I thought maybe doing her first tattoo together would make it less scary for her (I have multiple already). To my surprise she said that she actually wanted to ask me the same, but was afraid of being too pushy or something, so she was really happy :) 

We shared some pics of ideas and that was that. The next day she sent a tattoo design with  3 elements (obviously intended for 3 people)  and she asked me if we shouldn't ask our brother if he wants to join in. 

The thing is: we both do not like him very much and barely even have contact with him. I regularly call or chat w my sister and we do meet up from time to time, but outside of the mandatory birthday and Christmas events I have had a call with my brother once in like 4 years or something and that's it. And even then on these family gatherings it's just a cold Smalltalk what do u do how have u been kinda talk so I don't even really count that. 
I don't really like him because of his personality and because he dropped some homophobic comments every now and then ( I'm not openly gay) and my sister dislikes the way he views and talks about wimen sometimes and that he's kinda annoying about her veganism. 

She told me she doesn't really want him in and we should just ask him because she thought leaving him out and doing it ""behind his back"" I guess could hurt his feelings, which I totally understand. She also said that he probably thinks it's a stupid idea anyways and will say no.

 But then I also said that I'd think it to be worse if he was to agree to it, we were to get the tattoo all 3 together and some time later he were to find out that he was just an afterthought and that our sister and I didn't really want him in from the start and were so reluctant about it

So in conclusion: my sister and I both know he's not a horrible person, and if we avoid certain topics at the dinner table that he's totally fine to be around ( even if my sister really hates his wives guts lmaoo). Yet, I'm still really unsure. I get my sister, but I also really don't want him in. And I think that if she were to insist to get a 3 piece tattoo, then I'd decline the idea, because I really don't want a link between me and my brother permanently under my skin. Now that I typed that out, I don't think she will insist tho, after all she doesn't really want him in either...
 
What would u do in this situation? If u need some more details I'm happy to yap more about this. Sorry for weird wordings, English isn't my first language:)

So tldr would my sister and i be assholes if we got matching siblings tattoos without telling my brother or asking if he wants in? "

amitheasshole,AITA for not doing my chores,12,2025-03-31 14:28:27,24,"I (16 F) am currently experiencing nasty withdrawal from a medication i took for three months before abruptly stopping the medication. My symptoms include extreme lightheadedness, dizziness, fever, weakness, nausea/constant vomiting etc. safe to say I‚Äôm not doing well. I just got back from a doctors appointment where they did an EKG and checked my vitals in three positions as well as getting my blood drawn into ten vials so they can tell what I‚Äôm deficient in after i fasted for a whole day because i also have severe ARFID. When i got home the first thing i did was eat a poptart which i promptly threw up anyways because my stomach is so used to not having food that it rejects food i give to it. I went upstairs to go clean myself up and my sister entered the bathroom to put some towels away. She told me she had a friend coming over which i was fine with as long as they let me rest, she told me i needed to clean up my nail supplies and take out the trash. I was fine with cleaning my nail stuff up but the trash request pissed me off for two reasons.

1. My sister always makes me take out our bathroom trash. When she does do it she does not even put a trashbag in the trash can so you can always tell when i did it last and there is currently a trashbag in the can

2. Im going through withdrawal and im supposed to be laying down according to my doctors because if i move around too much there is a high chance of me fainting and hitting my head on something.

I told her no: i would not be taking out the trash but i would take my nail supplies out of the bathroom and i went to go lat down in my bed. My sister started yelling at me telling me i had to do the trash because it was a shared responsibility and to promise her i would do the trash. I told her i would if i could but i could not make any promises because i did not know how i would be feeling at the time i would have to take the trash out. She started yelling at me again and my dad asked what was going on after hearing her. She told him i would not bring the trash out. Since he was there at my hospital visit he told her i needed to rest. She accused him of jumping in to defend me when nobody even knew what was going on with me.

amitheasshole,AITA for going behind my husbands back and agreeing to count calories for my son?,0,2025-04-01 14:45:40,64,"
Me and my husband decided to post this disagreement online.

Our sons (20M, 23M) have body image issues and they both exercise. My youngest thinks he is overweight our oldest thinks he‚Äôs underweight, ‚ÄúCutting‚Äù and ‚ÄúBulking‚Äù respectively. They have convinced their sister (17F) to join in but she is not as neurotic as them.

We don‚Äôt agree this is healthy, but they are becoming adults and are allowed to make their own decisions. (A lot later than we ‚ÄúBecame‚Äù adults but I blame the economy and job market for that. It‚Äôs hard for them to get a consistent source of income) They pay for their gym membership and food. Not us.

We do, however, deal with the mess. They don‚Äôt slob and leave it all out for us to discover but I occasionally discover bits of seasoning or tomato paste on our tables and floors that pass them by. They insist they do clean up but seeing this in my home makes me feel insecure 

It culminated two weeks ago when our youngest son accidentally spilt onion powder across our table, sink, and floor. I ran downstairs after hearing a loud THUD, was incredibly angry, and banned him from touching anything in the kitchen indefinitely. When my husband returned he escalated it and said he wasn‚Äôt allowed to have his siblings ook anything for him, (Which they offered to do), I would have to cook his meals, and went on about how he was insane for counting calories and measuring food.

I agree with my husband, but don‚Äôt feel we have a right to dictate their eating habits. I banned him from my kitchen. If his siblings, who were not, wanted to help him out that‚Äôs their choice. I texted my youngest saying while I decide how much he eats, I would make he likes and use his food scale to measure it to the gram so that he is at least informed. This put him at ease.

A few days ago my husband walked in on me doing that, I see no reason to hide it from him as we all use his food scale. I told him I was making our sons food, he seemed incredibly upset. Later that night clarifying I went behind his back.

I told him that‚Äôs exactly what he did to me. We agree this is bad for their health but not on how much we ought to intervene. 

Yesterday we had a calm discussion on this, and gave our children an ultimatum. Our youngest is still not allowed to prepare his own food for the time being, but I will make what he wants and measure it. He can make requests and I will adjust accordingly. We have somewhat restricted our daughter and oldest‚Äôs kitchen privileges but they can cook for youngest within those lines, and can make requests from me. To offload the stress of always counting themselves.

My husband convinced them to take up martial arts, he feels if they want to obsess over calories, they ought have a reason to.

Main point: Am I wrong for going behind my husband‚Äôs back despite him going behind mine?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not visiting my boyfriend‚Äôs mom after he passed away?,4,2025-03-31 19:09:01,11,"For context my ex and I were together on and off for 6 yrs bffs for 10 when he passed away it felt like my whole world shattered and a nightmare. His body was found at the bottom of a cliff. what makes it even worse is he died while not on good terms with me.

He was living with me a week before and we ended up fighting over dishes in the sink. I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal, but he called me at work that day and said would you leave shit on the floor for 8 hours I said no that is not a comparison whatsoever it‚Äôs not a big deal I‚Äôll do the dishes and ignore it I honestly was so busy and didn‚Äôt think much of it but for him I guess this was not a good answer as I went home and he was gone. 

then a few days went by still nothing, I said I deserved an explanation, he finally said no explanation needed your stubbornness shined through I told him I didn‚Äôt mean for him to take it that way but at this point he was already relapsed on drugs and not himself.

He was also fighting with his mom who would constantly hold his dog against him and say he needed to come take care of his ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù which he corrected her saying it‚Äôs his ‚Äúfur child‚Äù which it actually was their family dog, she wouldn‚Äôt approve of me because I was from his drug past even though im 9 years clean. his mom was always our main reason why we would break up He felt like he owed them his life cause HES ADOPTED.

So fast forward to before he died I was hurt he wouldn‚Äôt come to me about his mom/relapse and texted he was a dick, good riddance, and blocked him.

So when his mother got his phone back she went through all our messages, next thing you know I wasn‚Äôt welcome at the funeral.

She said I don‚Äôt want you at the funeral cause you called me toxic in the texts with Matthew. I was in shock, I honestly just broke down hyperventilating crying, at that moment I realized just how toxic she was, but told her what I said out of anger in text shouldn‚Äôt be held against me. She said what will you do to make me let you come I told her I come with nothing but peace and love. So she said I was allowed to attend but that mine and Matthew‚Äôs relationship was too volatile and she hopes I move on and get someone better.  I was appalled of course, not only for the find someone better part but mostly cause he was the best man ever and we weren‚Äôt volatile at all, we never had big fights, he never raised his voice at me.

fast forward at the funeral my son wanted to speak after all he was like a step dad to him but they made it so only certain family members could speak, The mother mainly sat in the room by his ashes and spoke with so many people during and at the end when I had to go she finally said ‚Äú oh hunny we haven‚Äôt had a chance to speak yet can you come by and we have a talk sometime?‚Äù I hugged her and said of course, I‚Äôll pop by.

AITA for not popping by like I said Also his father walked up to me at the funeral with his dog and said ‚Äú this was Matthew‚Äôs real girlfriend here‚Äù"

I want to start off by saying I'm autistic and I don't have social cues. I know I can't use it as an excuse and typically if I don't get the response I was expecting I ask questions.

Me and A have a fuck you fuck you kind of realationship if you understand that. We joke around and make fun of each other.

We were emailing a couple of days ago and I said something along the lines of you need to go to hell.

I asked a friend about it after I got a response I wasn't expecting. He explained it very well and I wrote a lengthy apology to A.

However A wrote back to me, ""you need to get over yourself"". At this point I wrote back to him saying that he could've just accepted and we could've gotten over it. His response was, ""well I didn't say I didn't accept it"".

From there I just stopped talking to him. Because he started lying to our mutual friends.

About two days later my friend L asked why we weren't talking. I told her I apologized (she knew the beginning situation) and he told me in his first response, ""stop using autism as an excuse and get over it"". I know that this was probably a miscommunication, but I told her that as well as that it was most likely a miscommunication. She acted like she understood, and I told her to please not insert herself into the position of the peacemaker.

But going against my wishes she tried to fix it. She started asking why he told me to get over my autism. After she did that, L told more people about it.

A restarted the chat with the apology. He told me to stop lying to people. I told him what happened and of course he thought I was lying.

We cut off ties finally and he decided to go back to the chat and share it with about 20 people. Those people told him to stop sharing it and he refused. This typically wouldn't have been a big deal but I put very personal information in my apology that I don't want a ton of people to know.

Eventually he brought it back up in person and said ""I'm not going to stop sharing it until you apologize"". I finally lost it, I did apologize and just because he didn't accept it that doesn't mean I didn't accept it.

I yelled at him for his idiotic behavior and how I knew what I dis was wrong and how I apologized multiple times.

So AITAH for yelling at A after he shared personal things?"

amitheasshole,AITA for stepping back from my mum and brother after how they treated my partner and our child?,2,2025-03-31 21:18:50,4,"Throwaway.

My partner and I recently decided to step back from my mum and brother after things came to a head around our child‚Äôs first birthday. I‚Äôm not questioning stepping back itself, but I do wonder if fully cutting contact instead of just taking space was too much.

A few weeks before the birthday, our child stayed overnight at my parents‚Äô house. They had a slight cold beforehand, but nothing serious. The next day, we got photos where they looked visibly unwell ‚Äî pale, tired, and off. When they got home, they had a dangerously high fever, were shivering, and were barely conscious. We called a doctor immediately.

When asked for basic information (symptoms, medicine, meals, etc.) I called my mum, who became defensive and vague. Both my parents denied anything was wrong, claiming our child must have gotten ill during the 20-minute car journey because they were ‚Äútoo warm.‚Äù This didn‚Äôt make sense to us, but my dad later privately admitted that our child had seemed unwell earlier and apologised for how it was handled. My mum, however, stuck to the ‚Äúcar journey‚Äù excuse, even after my dad owned up and tried to clear the air.

We calmly said we weren‚Äôt comfortable with overnight stays for the time being, especially since our child‚Äôs cousin has had health issues and we didn‚Äôt want to risk anyone else getting sick. Somehow, this was twisted into us ‚Äúkeeping the cousins apart.‚Äù

My dad took responsibility, apologised, and attended our child‚Äôs birthday without issue. My mum, however, saw an apology message my dad sent to my partner, took a screenshot, and on the morning of the birthday texted saying she wouldn‚Äôt be attending, calling it the ‚Äúfinal straw.‚Äù

I tried to explain calmly that we were prioritising both kids‚Äô wellbeing, but she accused us of pushing the family away. Shortly after, my brother called repeatedly, then ranted ‚Äî not at me ‚Äî but directly at my partner, accusing her of controlling me and causing drama. For context, my partner is autistic, very non-confrontational, and has always been respectful, even when treated poorly. This left her devastated.

Other grievances suddenly came up ‚Äî that they weren‚Äôt at the hospital when our child was born (they were out drinking), that they didn‚Äôt meet our child straight away (they never asked), and that my partner made a harmless baby shower comment months ago, which they took personally.

The most hurtful was hearing they told my grandfather I ‚Äúhated my childhood.‚Äù My grandparents practically raised me ‚Äî something my mum has always admitted. My gran passed away over a decade ago, and hearing this devastated me. I immediately called my grandad in tears to reassure him.

After all this, we stepped back fully. My dad, who has been mature throughout, still sees us, but we‚Äôve cut off my mum, brother, and others involved. Extended family now say we‚Äôre being too harsh. I don‚Äôt regret protecting my partner and child, but I do wonder if fully going no-contact was too much.

I moved out from my roommates apartment and left almost all my belongings there (just part of my situation I was in months ago) leaving me with almost nothing to move with into this apartment. I have a good chunk of savings, but any help I have been getting has been a miracle. 

I asked if we could split the Walmart gift card so I could get a bunch of little things for bathroom and kitchen. My brother-in-law and sister said no as they were using it to get a new TV. I told them about my plight and they just said they would be on the lookout for some of the things I needed. 

Anyways, it got time for application and I put nobody as my referral. When I left the management office I went over to their apartment to eat dinner and celebrate. They asked if I referred them and I said I left it blank. They got kind of upset saying it took no effort or money on my part, and I was essentially helping no one in the situation. They are demanding I go back in and say I was referred but i don‚Äôt think they will let me and I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself like that. 

They have their place established, they pay less rent because they split it, they have all the furniture. I need the help and they refused. Ya it was free and easy to do, but they couldn‚Äôt even split it for me. 

AITA?

TLDR; Refused to put sister and brother in law as referral bonus  so they missed out on their referral bonus because they wouldn‚Äôt split it with me 

Update: my application was approved and I‚Äôm moving in May!!! Decided to let them know they referred me and they said noted‚Ä¶whether they split it or not making a landlord pay up is always a good deed. Also some of you need therapy if you‚Äôre raging at an online person with revenge fantasy and incel fantasy‚Äôs over a situation you‚Äôre not in over a gift card. That‚Äôs not how normal people think or say!"
amitheasshole,AITA husband called me racist,0,2025-04-01 15:06:57,117,"AITA we were listening to my husband's YouTube playlist in the car yesterday.A song came on, and it was in a different language. I want to say Ukrainian, but I'm not sure.

I said ""is this even english, i don't want to listen to it, i can't understand it."" and I changed the song.

Then he escalated the situation by saying ""i don't understand spanish, so all Mexican's need to go back to Mexico"", and he called me a 'Racist' 


So I can't change a song i don't understand, or that makes me Racist? That's too much. I have a right to change a song. Am I Racist if I change an English song that I don't want to listen to? That makes no sense.

Soooo does that mean I can put on ANY song of any language, and he's forced to listen to it, and if he doesn't, I can call him a racist? I doesn't make sense.

ETA: he is a very extreme liberal.
I'm Hispanic and speak English and Spanish. "
amitheasshole,AITA for complimenting a guy with a wife,356,2025-03-30 16:42:40,305,"I (16F) have had extremely bad social anxiety my entire life. So bad that until the end of middle school I was basically mute in public. The therapist i‚Äôm working with abt this suggested I try complimenting someone. After this, when I was at the store I saw someone with an XO Weeknd hoodie, I was genuinely curious where he got it from. For context, this is a grown man with a wife and a toddler. I didn‚Äôt think this would be wrong since I‚Äôm VERY CLEARLY a teenager. I walk up to him and say, ‚Äúwhere did you get that hoodie from? I love the Weeknd‚Äù and the guy replies, in the rudest tone he possibly can, ‚Äúonline‚Äù then his wife looked me up and down and said ‚Äúthat compliment wasn‚Äôt necessary‚Äù and that was the end of the interaction. It prob doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal to most but this was a huge step for me. Some ppl I told abt this are siding with me but others think i‚Äôm in the wrong since I had a crop top on (with baggy jeans, nothing extremely revealing) while complimenting a guy with a gf

EDIT: I look my age, if not younger. this man looked in his 30‚Äôs or 40‚Äôs. people assuming that I (as a barely 16 year old) had other intentions is a little crazy to me. I would have never said anything if it was a couple around my age. I genuinely wanted to know where the hoodie was from lol

amitheasshole,AITA for getting Bob Dylan tickets,1,2025-04-01 00:23:16,26,"So Bob Dylan's coming to play a concert near me (in MN where he hasn't performed for a long time and where might not again for a long time either). I'm in college and don't have a car but I have a friend who does. We originally were going to get tickets together but then when we saw they were super expensive (like $500) we decided not to. That was a few months ago -- today, I started thinking I really would like to go and checked again and the tickets were $100. I asked my friend and he wasn't very into it. He said Bob Dylan would sound bad and weird and depressing (I agree, that's why I want to go) and that on principle he did not want to spend any money on something he might not enjoy. Because this seems like a once in a life time thing and I thought it would be if nothing else a very interesting experience and I tried to talk him into it. He said that he would agree to go if I paid for gas and both tickets. With this in mind, I got the tickets, (though, as he wants me to add, I did not tell him before doing it). I then said that while I had no expectation of it, it would be nice if I could get paid back a little bit (as money is not always so easy to come by for college students). He said he would pay for about half of his ticket but then said that I put him in a very uncomfortable situation. By buying the tickets and then asking for him to pay for any part of it, it put him in a situation where he said he could not come off as a good friend without paying, which meant I essentially forced him to pay. Thoughts?

We worked on this together"
amitheasshole,AITA for not allowing in-laws to see their grandkids,107,2025-03-30 22:09:55,71,"[UPDATE]

I brought this conversation up again to my husband and even brought up previous events where his parents have said no even to him directly when he asked to also take my youngest. He took a minute to think about it. While he was thinking the oldest walks in to the kitchen I guess she over heard the conversation (I thought she was playing with her brothers in the playroom) and told her dad that she too had noticed a division. She told us that last week they went to a party and because my son couldn‚Äôt go there was a lot bag still made for him. (We sent a gift with them) When they gave the oldest the lotbag and explained it was for our son the grandparents grabbed it and said ‚Äúno he doesn‚Äôt need one‚Äù .. in the car ride back she questioned her grandma why my son was never invited to come out with them..too which the grandma replied ‚Äúoh because we like just spending time with the two of you‚Äù‚Ä¶ my oldest said she didn‚Äôt know how to tell her dad but it made her feel sad and she didn‚Äôt want to go out anymore with them if her brother wasn‚Äôt coming. She ended up calling down her brother (8) and asked him if what she said was true and he said ‚Äúyes‚Äù‚Ä¶ which then my husband grabbed the keys and is driving to talk to them rn. Mind you they only live 10 minutes away!..



My husband (32) and I (33) have been together for 6 years now we have two boys one is 3 and the other is 3 months. My partner was in a previous marriage (now divorced) and had 2 kids 8 & 10‚Ä¶ In the previous years since my son has been born I‚Äôve noticed certain things that my In-laws do with my husbands other kids then mine. I ignored it because I thought maybe because he‚Äôs young still so they can‚Äôt do certain things with him. But my husbands oldest sister has a daughter who‚Äôs 4 and she‚Äôs always tagging along with them too.

EX: last summer the kids and his niece 3 went to a theme park together with the grandparents. They never asked if my son could go.. it‚Äôs not like they make these plans last minute they have them planed weeks. Or when they take only them to the mall buy them toys, food etc.. but never take or bring anything for my son. It started to be more obvious and one day his mom said to me ‚ÄúI just feel real bad for them because they come from divorced parents‚Äù‚Ä¶ but his oldest sister is ALSO divorced and her kids went through the same situation and get the same treatment as my husbands other kids.

Today, they wanted us to book our tickets to Dominican and we‚Äôre not going due to finances so they offered to take the other 2 kids..I was a little bothered by this because why not ask for my son too who‚Äôs turning 4 in May?‚Ä¶I brought it up to my husband and he even said that they have a little more affection towards his two oldest because of the divorce. To make another note I ALWAYS go all out for their birthday and make them feel loved and at home, they call me their second mom. So it‚Äôs not like they never get what they want either.. but this sorta pissed me off because all grandkids should be treated the same and if mine were going to be excluded then I didn‚Äôt want them around them which I told him and he got upset because he thinks I‚Äôm making a big deal out of nothing. I told him to talk to them and ask why they don‚Äôt include our other boy but he said no..So AITA for now not wanting them around my kids until he speaks to his parents..

***it isn‚Äôt so much about the trip but about how they exclude him from everything even though they take their other grandkids who‚Äôs 4 months age gap from our son.***"
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my boyfriend to change his appearance?,41,2025-03-31 03:31:16,65,"I (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for close to two years and he is finally meeting my dad(52m). My boyfriend (let‚Äôs call him Pete) is a very carefree person and doesn‚Äôt care what people think of him or his appearance. I am also a little carefree and don‚Äôt care what people think I look like. My dad is coming to visit in a week or two and he really wants to meet my boyfriend. I had asked Pete if he could possibly wear jeans instead of pajama pants or sweat pants when he meets my dad because I want his first impression to be very good. He didn‚Äôt like that and told me no I asked him why and he said ‚Äúwhy would I change what I‚Äôm wearing because you want me to when you didn‚Äôt do that when you met my parents‚Äù. For reference I met his parents when we first got together and I didn‚Äôt even know we were going to meet up with his parents when we did because I had just gotten off of work when we did. I couldn‚Äôt drive due to an accident I was in and when I asked for him to drive me home so I wasn‚Äôt dirty he wouldn‚Äôt, he just drove straight to his parents. So I would be wearing a dirty/greasy hoodies and ripped up jeans. I let him know that I feel it would be more respectful if he wore something a little nicer so my dad didn‚Äôt think my boyfriend was disrespectful and/or rude and didn‚Äôt care about meeting my hero/the person I look up to. So AITA for asking him to change his appearance when meeting my dad? 

Edit: Thank you for all the comments I wanted to clear somethings up. He does wear jeans to work and other family events. He has a bigger wardrobe than I do so it‚Äôs not a big deal to ask him to wear jeans. For job interviews in the past he has worn outfits that take more effort than when we go to dinners, just the two of us. For all those saying that I‚Äôm trying to create a false image of him is not true. He will wear a button up and really nice jeans to his family events and interviews and work, but as soon as it comes to the two of us he does wear just sweatpants and pjs."
amitheasshole,AITA for asking to go to the pub with my friends?,1,2025-03-31 22:58:40,4,"For context, me (20M) and my gf (20F) have been together for nearly a year and a half. We‚Äôve argued a lot recently about a lot of things, and there was a time last year where she felt like I would rather be with my friends then her, which I didn‚Äôt resonate with because I really love her and would rather be with her than them. The last time I saw my friends was 5 months ago as I‚Äôve been at University, but I‚Äôve just got back 3 days ago and I‚Äôve seen them on 2 occasions. Me and my girlfriend go to different universities, but we make sure to call every day and see each other once every 1-3 weeks, we even went on holiday together in December.

So last night, I said I wanted to go see the Minecraft movie with her, and I said maybe I can come see it with you on Friday (we live 2 hour 30 mins from each other so we can‚Äôt see each other every day). She didn‚Äôt really acknowledge it as plans, she said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just gonna go see it with someone else‚Äù but that was it.

So then today I go to play football with my friends and they say about going to the pub on Friday, skip to later and we‚Äôre on the phone and she says about her cousin‚Äôs barbecue which is on Sunday near her‚Äôs, and I say ok and I‚Äôll come up on Saturday. She‚Äôs like I thought you were coming up on Friday to watch Minecraft, and I said I might go to the pub with my friends that day.

Nearly immediately she starts shouting at me, saying I always do this (this happened only once before when I thought I couldn‚Äôt make something but then I realised I could), she says how I always choose my friends over her, that she doesn‚Äôt feel prioritised, that I lack empathy and that she doesn‚Äôt want to see me now.

I feel like I should‚Äôve done better in how I bringing it up to her before, while not letting her have to mention the weekend for it to come up in conversation. But I also don‚Äôt agree with it being a thing where I‚Äôm choosing her or my friends, because I don‚Äôt see it like that and when she goes to hang out or play online with her friends I don‚Äôt view her as choosing someone over me. But I know she sees it differently and I understand that, and I want her to be happy and not have to feel like this. "

        For starters me and my mom have always been close. I‚Äôve been by her side through many many problems. 
Drinking , men, ect. She doesn‚Äôt have great luck with men- the one she currently married to is a real big guy- who has anger issues also has been known to get roudy. 
      I‚Äôve kinda been my mom‚Äôs rock and helped her whenever I could I was her therapist friend and not really daughter it seems. I‚Äôve maintained good grades honor roll been in school working and college for my whole teen life and adult life. 
     It has kinda always been expected of me to multi task and drop everything when it comes to my mom- which she constantly says I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have to‚Äù but if you have a dependent narcissistic parent you understand tone very well.  I had to even pay to retake college classes and miss work for her. 
         Anyway, I‚Äôm 22 now me and my fiance moved into a house with our dog and I‚Äôm very happy to have a place of our own! I‚Äôm also graduating this April with my bachelor‚Äôs degree and I‚Äôve worked very hard. I‚Äôve helped her financially these past three years with about 12 grand and hurt me and my fiance financially. 
         He didn‚Äôt know about all of it but we talked everything is ok now and we are prioritizing our little three person family. However, The day before we got our keys to our home. My mom calls me in a manic state asking to move in and for me to rescue her (again) and I was at work. I‚Äôve been in therapy and talking with my fiance to work on my boundaries and confidence- and well I told her no. I also knew she would run back to her man- but either way getting in between the two of them during an argument is terrifying to me. 
          I can‚Äôt keep being a referee to two adults almost in their 40‚Äôs, She cut off the phone sent me tik tocks about neglect and feeling like a burden saying she‚Äôs sorry to add to my plate and enjoy your new house and graduation kinda making me feel just horrible. I sent her a long heart felt message on how I need to work on myself get my career going and keep my mental health financial health and life just above water and that I love her but can‚Äôt continue to be a babysitter for her life choices. She simply responded I‚Äôm not reading that and im sorry to ever burden you I‚Äôm cutting everyone off. 
           Turns out they were short for rent again and they got evicted. So their two dogs and them are living in their two cars- I feel so guilty to enjoy my new house while they are in cars. AITA? "
amitheasshole,AITA for lashing out at my friend,5,2025-03-31 14:02:16,13,"(first time poster long time lurker)
For context me and my friend 19f both are on 2week trip to south korea and japan. 

The trip has been going a bit sideways since day 2 and we are on day 10 now. My friend has a habit of being passiveaggressive and childish when everything doesnt go as she wants. I understood the risk of her being somewhat passiveaggressive and annoying for part of the time on the trip not most of it. It is well known thing in our friendgroup that she is not a nice person to be around when she is being passiveaggressive. Biggest incidence on the trip with bunch of small inconveniences due to her passiveaggressive nature has been the day we had early morning flight from seoul to tokyo. I had reserved 17k won for airport bus fare and I said multiple times how I have exactly 17k no more no less. On the morning of when we are already running a bit late she is confused why I didnt reserve 17k for her bus fare too and she scrambles around trying to find bank automat at 4am. When she finally found one we were already 35min late and had a tight schedule. And she seemed mad abt me not reserving money for her ticket.

Today when we were sitting on a bench looking at cherry blossoms it was pretty cold and I said im a bit cold and asked her if we could walk around or go to shinjuku which was next on our activity list. She said she doesnt wanna go shinjuku since it is so cold and laughed how it will be warmer at the weekend when I leave back home and she stays a couple of extra days. She said that she will visit there maybe on those days. After a while I asked her again if we can walk around or go somewhere that is not shinjuku if she wants to go later. She didnt wanna get up and I felt so cold and frustrated that I just stood up and said that I will be leaving and I cant always be the one compromising. If it had been her who was cold we would have been long gone from the cherry blossom place. I went to shinjuku after and had fun looking around.

Now back at hotel she barely acknowledges me. And she says I am the one that is being weird and ditches her all the time (I did ditch her today and day before bcs I lost her and thought she ditched me but otherwise she has been ditching me). When I asked for code for our mount fuji tour which is tomorrow she sounded mad. I just want the code bcs she doenst wanna get up early ever and she is late to everywhere.

So am I the asshole. I feel bad for enjoying alone time more than time with her bcs with her im walking on the eggshells."

Her story changed like 5 times but by the end she stuck with apparently we shouldn‚Äôt get married because I have trust issues and we haven‚Äôt gone to pre-marital counseling. We think she is jealous because she is his older sister almost 30 and wanted to get married first.

I am still grieving the fact that my relationship I thought I had with her is gone and she was even going to be my maid of honor.

I let him stay at my house on the couch, for free, a few years ago when he got out of jail and had no family members talking to him.   After that he only talked to me when it suited him.  Last December I broke my ankle and in January he broke up with his fianc√©e and asked to stay with me.  I allowed it because a friend of mine was in need.   During the month that he stayed, while I couldn‚Äôt walk, he didn‚Äôt really help me out much, and again he was staying at my house for free.  Once he moved out, he left his Range Rover in my driveway.  
One day out of the blue he called me and said the repo man was coming to take the car so he needed me to get all of his belongings out of the car.  Which, I was still not on my feet fully, and two, a heads up would have been nice instead of the man being in my driveway as we speak. 
I took out some important documents and his daughter‚Äôs car seat. 
Flash forward weeks later I keep asking him to come get his stuff.  I texted him and told him again to come get his stuff and jokingly I said, my cat has been laying in the car seat like he‚Äôs the baby lol.
He flipped out on me!  Saying WOW, thanks for that, you can just throw the whole car seat away, why would you have your cat in there??
First and foremost, should have come picked up your shit, secondly, he‚Äôs a cat and he‚Äôs obsessively clean??
Thirdly, you can take the top part off and clean it??
He blocked me and I then of course blocked him.  
But AITA for thinking it was cute that my cat was the baby in the car seat??  After everything I did for this mf?

amitheasshole,"AITA for standing in the aisle and ""boxing out"" a woman behind me who wanted to the exit the plane first?",0,2025-04-01 20:14:00,245,"I recently flew on a domestic (USA) flight on United Airlines.  I was seated in economy class, row 31, aisle seat. Livin' large.

The plane lands on time in Sacramento. We stop taxiing.  The light dings.  I immediately stand up and get my bulky backpack out of the bin and then remain standing in the aisle, wearing the backpack over one shoulder.  

To be honest, I do this deliberately. I stand in the aisle while waiting to exit the plane so that people in the rows behind don't rush the aisle and get off the plane before me. 

As I'm standing in the aisle, I notice that no one in rows 25-30 has gotten up.  The aisle is only blocked by people standing from about row 24 and sporadically further up.

Do I ""shoot the gap"" and walk past the people patiently sitting in rows 25-30 and go stand behind the people in the aisle at row 24? Of course not. I have manners.  I wait my turn standing in the aisle by my seat in row 31. 

At this point, a woman behind me taps me on the shoulder and politely asks me to move, presumably so that she can ""shoot the gap"" and try to improve her exiting position by scooting up to row 24, or perhaps further if she could get those folks to step out of her way.

I ask why she wants me to move, she didn't speak much English but gestured that she wanted to move ahead me toward the inviting gap.  I responded that I can't do that, there are people ahead of us who are entitled to get off first.

She gave me a dirty look in Spanish, which I would translate into English as ""What do you think you are, the aisle sheriff, just move, you sad little man.""  

I refused to move, I stood there awkwardly blocking her from exiting for like ten minutes as I waited for all the rows ahead of us to deplane.

We met when I was 21 and knew pretty quickly that we were soulmates. My husband bought me a laptop a few years ago as a Valentines day present from some bonus money he got from his job and I was incredibly grateful.

I use my laptop for writing, gaming and photography editing which takes up a lot of space on my laptop already. My husband, however, has an older model laptop and sometimes wants to use my laptop for his reasons because it works better for him.

I have told him that I am not comfortable with him using it because I am worried that it will take up too much space and crash my computer. He thinks I am being selfish for not letting him borrow it from time to time and though respects my wishes, is evidently very annoyed at me about my opinion.

For more context, he uses my laptop for one purpose generally...and that is for creating ""enjoyable"" content on movie maker using ""enjoyable"" pictures that he finds online. I don't mind that he does this on his own laptop, but on MY laptop, it just feels wrong.

Am I the asshole for not being OK with him using my laptop for his purposes or is he right that I am being selfish since he bought it for me in the first place and he needs a laptop sometimes with a faster processing speed?"
amitheasshole,AITA? Should my brother‚Äôs girlfriend be in my wedding?,33,2025-03-31 04:06:46,39,"I'm being pressured by my family to have my brothers girlfriend in my wedding. Me and my brother have a close relationship and I used to be close with his girlfriend (they've been together 4 years). Me and her had a little falling out almost a year ago and we haven't been close since. I had been thinking about this prior to engagement but would have been willing to have her in the wedding for my brother. And then I got engaged.. 

When I got engaged I was so excited, obviously, calling everyone to let them know the good news. When I called my brothers gf I could literally hear the disappointment and jealousy in her voice, it instantly brought my mood down. Moving on to that night we went over to my parents house, she didnt hug me, you could still sense the jealousy and could tell she was crying, she didn't want to do a champagne toast or eat dinner and was just a debby downer on a day that was supposed to be full of excitement. 

I found out afterwards that she has since been freaking out on my brother because she didn't have a ring yet and it was fully clear jealousy got the best of her. She has not asked me a single question about the wedding, about my plans, didn't offer any help with my engagement party, and we literally haven't talked besides being at a family function. 

I'm someone who gets over stimulated very easily and a wedding is already a high stress day. I'm having a small bridal party (4) who are my closest friends and that's it. My parents are worried it will cause a wedge between me and my brother and are telling me I'm in the wrong. My brother says that she is going to be ""devastated"" when she finds out because she's expecting to be in it? (Not sure what would give her that impression). And everyone who knows her and this dynamic is telling me not to do it and it will ruin my day. Am I the asshole for not wanting to have her in it?

amitheasshole,AITA For Visiting My Girlfriend At Her Dorm?,25,2025-03-31 04:40:46,24,"I (M19) have been dating my girlfriend (F19) for over a year now. We met during our freshman year of college when we lived across the hall from each other, and we started dating pretty early on. My roommate also ended up dating one of her suitemates, so naturally, we all hung out as a group a lot. We‚Äôd go to parties, do Secret Santa, and just have a good time. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was super close with her friends, but we all felt friendly enough.

I‚Äôve always respected the time my girlfriend spends with her friends‚ÄîI don‚Äôt try to intrude on their girls' nights, and I don‚Äôt even go to parties that often. But even last year, I sometimes felt like her friends saw me as an outsider or like I was imposing when I was around. They‚Äôd make little comments, like reminding me that I wasn‚Äôt invited to girls' nights (even though I never asked to go) or making weird remarks about what they‚Äôd do if they saw my girlfriend dancing on other guys. One time, on our three-month anniversary, her friends literally came to her door and begged her to ditch our plans to go frat-hopping.

This year, things have gotten worse. My roommate and I now live on the other side of campus, so it‚Äôs more of an effort to see our girlfriends. Whenever I go over (usually because my girlfriend invited me), her roommates act cold and distant but are also comfortable making slick comments. One time, my girlfriend wasn‚Äôt in her room when I got there, so I pulled out my phone to text her. In the two seconds I was doing that, her roommates paused their movie and immediately started questioning me‚Äîlike, ""Do you need something?"" and ""Why are you here?"" in a tone that made it clear they weren‚Äôt happy to see me.

On Valentine‚Äôs Day, my roommate and I were sitting in the common room waiting for our girlfriends to get ready when one of their roommates walked in and started questioning what we were doing there, almost like she thought we were just loitering in their space.

But today really set me off. One of my girlfriend‚Äôs friends told her to tell me I had small feet, and when I came out, I realized they had¬†*moved my shoes*‚Äîas in, they had been touching them and apparently joking about selling them. I don‚Äôt really care about the joke itself, but I do care about the double standard. These are the same people who are quick to tell me to respect their space, but they think it‚Äôs funny to mess with my stuff?

I texted her that i loved her and it was read but no reply all day. She was working but still always will text and even call me when shes at work in the past. Then she texted me that she made it home. Its late and i was already typing out shit then deleting it all day. I think its good i didnt keep texting her but now idk what to say. Like ok glad you made it home how was ur day, when all i can think of is how she dosnt care how i feel it seems like. Am I the ass hole if i just wait till tomorrow to text her?

amitheasshole,AITA for not inviting my uncle to my daughter‚Äôs graduation?,299,2025-03-30 14:30:37,50,"(I meant to write brother not uncle)My daughter and nephew, my sister‚Äôs son, are graduating from the same school this year. Unfortunately, my brother and sister have been fighting and causing trouble whenever they‚Äôre near each other for the last couple of years. This has strained our family, requiring us to have separate holidays and events at my parents‚Äô house to avoid conflict. My sister has made it abundantly clear that she doesn‚Äôt want my brother at any event involving her children, including graduation. She has even threatened to create a scene, take her children, and leave if he shows up to anything her children are involved in, even if my children are also present.  

I find myself caught in the middle of this conflict because I harbor no animosity towards either of them and refuse to exclude one from my life. As the eldest child, they are both my siblings. My parents, overwhelmed by their behavior, have lost the motivation to try and reconcile them and have accepted the fact they are not willing to work things out. 

Today, my brother asked me about his graduation tickets. I informed him that I wasn‚Äôt sure how many tickets we were getting and might not have enough for everyone, as my husband‚Äôs side of the family also wanted to attend. I tried to give him the details about the graduation party, but he immediately took offense to this news, became angry, and said he wouldn‚Äôt attend any party if he couldn‚Äôt come to the ceremony. He hung up on me and then took to Facebook to vent about how he felt abused by his family. With this reaction, I don‚Äôt think I want to even try to fight my sister over him attending the ceremony.

My brother, who isn‚Äôt very involved in my children‚Äôs lives, frequently skips their events, even though he promises to attend. This has been particularly difficult for me and the kids, especially since he makes an effort to be present for his wife‚Äôs nephew‚Äôs events.  However, he is their uncle and lives them in his own way. 

So AITH for not offering a ticket or trying to convince my sister to let my brother attend graduation?  I just want to avoid issues and drama on what should be a happy day focused on the kids achievement."
amitheasshole,AITA (23F) for ignoring my mom‚Äôs calls for a few days for yelling at me for getting too dark from the sun?,138,2025-03-30 18:04:22,44,"UPDATE: I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone when I get time, but it‚Äôs hard so I‚Äôm sorry if I didn‚Äôt get to you! I have read everyone‚Äôs comments though, so thank you for the validation! I do love my parents but my mom can be very mean. I know deep down all these insane comments just come from a place of wanting what‚Äôs best for me. Right idea but wrong execution. My mom is very much about being presentable which is a major character flaw lol, but it is what it is. It‚Äôs just what she was raised with and now she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to change. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not being a bitch by taking some space to myself though.

I‚Äôm from India, and this should tell you enough about the situation I‚Äôm in. In India, the general consensus is that the darker you are, the uglier you are. It‚Äôs very outdated I know. My family moved to the United States when I was 4. I now live on my own while still getting financially supported by my family. I graduate this August, and I‚Äôm currently actively applying to jobs to be able to support myself. We are visiting India in June for a cousin‚Äôs wedding. She‚Äôs been more adamant about me wearing sunscreen to not get darker so I can be presentable for the trip. Mind you, my dad is pretty dark and my mom isn‚Äôt that white either. 

I also DO NOT CARE AT ALL about the color of my skin. I don‚Äôt think anyone should care. I wear sunscreen when I go out for the sole reason of taking care of my skin and NOT to control how much I tan. I‚Äôm also not panicking 24/7 about making sure to reapply every 2 hours. I try my best but sometimes I forget so obviously I‚Äôll tan a little. I also have my own insecurities and it‚Äôs so frustrating to have my mom project these insecurities on to me. My parents are very supportive financially but emotionally they are horrendous. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. 

This all started because I sent a picture me at a tour of a company I want to work at, and I looked a tan (but there were also shadows involved). She immediately called me yelling at me saying I‚Äôm trying to get darker on purpose to spite her because she knows I don‚Äôt like when she‚Äôs picky about my skin color. I didn‚Äôt say anything and just hung up once she started raising her voice. I‚Äôve come to accept that older generations have a hard time changing their opinions and also ignore a lot of unhinged things they do since I know they still love me and makes sure I‚Äôm housed and fed and sends me money if I really need it. 

Indian people are very much about ‚Äúwhat will other people think?‚Äù and looking/being ‚Äúpresentable‚Äù even if it means being rude to their family members for it. I‚Äôve just come to accept that this is just the outdated, insane way of some folks in India. Trust me, I‚Äôve spoken to her out this countless times and now I‚Äôm just tired. 

EDIT: Oh and she also claims she wants me to put on sunscreen for my skin health and not because I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúdarker.‚Äù I just have a hard time believing this

EDIT: Please ignore any grammar/spelling mistakes. I was rushing to type this and didn‚Äôt really double check what autocorrect was changing things to."
amitheasshole,AITA for defending myself to my in laws?,10,2025-03-31 09:11:24,24,"We'll, my father in law, let's call him Tom (65), went out with my dad let's call him Jim (66), and my now husband for the suits for the wedding. My husband, Jim and Tom went to men's warehouse and chose the suits for themselves and the groomsmen. The groomsmen had purple ties to match the bridesmaids dresses. My husband had black and our dad's wore a lighter purple tie. 

On a phone call later that week the following was said by my mother in law ""Its not going to match my dress"" (the women chose navy, instead of lavender like I requested). Then my father in law said my dad ""has control over it"". Eventhough my husband had control over the suits. 

Fast forward to my wedding shower. I made it clear to everyone in my immediate family I didn't want to open gifts during that time and we went table to table saying thank you, but gifts won't be opened. We got to my mother in laws table and she threw a fit saying ""you know nothing"" and yelled this very loudly. So the remainder of her sisters came up to me telling me I look bad and I need to open gifts.

Later on I confronted them and they basically told me I'm ungrateful for everything. Along with the fact that I needed to keep traditions going when I don't want to focus on present. 

During my wedding rehersal, they basically called me out in front of everyone for having anxiety, and my father in law wouldn't let me go during a goodbye hug and repeatedly told me to calm down. I was overwhelmed at this point. 

Wedding day is here and at my reception my sister in law, Allison (26f), proceeded to tell my sister and a childhood friend she needs a drink before my dads speech. That made me upset because my dad has asperges and I'm overprotective of him because of this. I let it go for the time being to not ruin my wedding day. 

Later on that Monday after we married, we opened cards and stuff. My in laws wrote us a 10k check and I knew this was hush money/ control money. We called them of course to say thanks, but I told my husband I don't want this money. 

This past couple of days I finally had enough of there control and said that I'd appreciate the space for my husbands birthday and I to do whatever he wanted and that was one big party, not multiple days. We'll the in laws pushed him into multiple days. Saying to him traditions shouldn't change just because we just got married. This to me, undermines our marriage. 

Welp they denied that and basically called me crazy. I also texted my sister in law asking for if she said what was told me at the reception in reference to my dad. I asked her to just be careful with what she said and now per my in laws I attacked her and I can't bring up anything else to her. They have offered to cut themselves out of our lives because I have ""changed"", but due to some work stuff I had to fight through i found my voice and stuck up for myself. They don't like this with me sticking up for myself. 

So AITA for standing up for myself to my in laws by calling them out on there wrong doings? "
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friend that I do not want to room with her anymore after she applied and paid?,2,2025-03-31 16:35:52,6,"My two roommates and I were looking for a fourth roommate in the last week before housing applications were due. I thought of my ex-roommate who is currently a commuter on campus. I asked and they all agreed to have her to fill in.  So i go ahead and asked my ex-roommate if she would like to room with us to which she says yes.  We did run into some issues which would not allow her to join the group on the online application but other than that she completed the application and I believe she even paid the deposit.  She asked if I or one of my current roommates could email housing about it and we said we would on Monday or the weekend as it was Friday after the housing office had closed.  Come Sunday night, I talk with my mom and she reminds me of how my ex-roommate was and how extreme their level of messiness is.  She encouraged me to look elsewhere and I asked my current roommates and they also remembered how messy she was and her personality in general. Another big thing that was not mentioned earlier is that she can be very condescending towards others and has been known to make others feel stupid while also passing off simple tasks to others due to laziness.  She also does not like to go out, even to just do something fun on campus and she prefers to stay in her room and lay in bed. Now we are back tracking on having her as a roommate and we already found a replacement but now my ex-roommate is asking about her status with housing and if we resolved the issue and even said that she would talk to housing. I am not sure if I should try to make up a lie in order to try to preserve the friendship or if I should just be honest with her.  I also feel bad if she paid the deposit so I believe either I reimburse her or ask my roommates to pitch in. "
amitheasshole,AITA for refusing to move beds in a hostel in the middle of the night?,3231,2025-03-30 00:27:57,222,"I was in a hostel trying to sleep (top bunk) when I heard a sound and I guess it woke me up a little (12:20 AM )by the sound of the door opening and then I see a shadow moving near my backpack. Suddenly my silhouette of my backpack moves
I was so started that I lunged and snatched it back, then looked down to see a guy standing there. Instead of apologizing, he immediately started loudly talking to me: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in my bed, I need you to get out of my bed!‚Äù

For context: My actual assigned bed (a bottom bunk) was already occupied by someone else when I arrived, so I picked an empty top bunk instead. I tried explaining this, he said sorry but the guy starts smirking, exhaling sarcastically, and repeating, I told him to just use another bed that‚Äôs free but he said what If I sleep in a bed that is already booked and kept going The hostel gave me this bed. Germans take rules seriously!(He looked mid-30s, and I‚Äôm currently in Germany btw)  

Finally, another sleeper snapped awake and shouted, ‚ÄúJust pick a damn bed and shut up‚Äîyou‚Äôre waking everyone!‚Äù Only then did the guy grumble and chose another bed.  
away.  

So, AITA here? I get that hostels have rules, but:  
1. He took my backpack first (Who takes another persons item like that?).  
2. He could‚Äôve quietly found staff or another bed instead of screaming at midnight.  
3. My original bed was already occupied was I supposed to get out and choose another bed or something?  

Kinda baffled by the audacity. Thoughts?  

EDIT: Since many are criticizing me for not notifying reception about the bed mix up, I‚Äôll clarify:  
- When I arrived, the person in my assigned bed was already asleep and was already pretty settled in (snoring, lights off). I didn‚Äôt want to wake them, so I chose the empty top bunk that was fully made up with clean sheets no personal items, clearly unused. I assumed it was free game since hostels often have spare beds.  
- I genuinely didn‚Äôt realize people were this strict about assigned beds (lesson learned: always report it)
- Tomorrow,I‚Äôll ask reception to reassign me to avoid further issues.  

That said, I still think the guy was out of line for:  
1. Grabbing my backpack instead of speaking to me first.  
2. Yelling at midnight instead of solving it quietly.

amitheasshole,AITAH for going behind my SIL‚Äôs back?,2,2025-03-31 19:44:38,16,"I don‚Äôt know how to formulate the title question better but here‚Äôs what happened:

Last year around this time, I (27f) was like 6 months pregnant. I had my parents-in-law over for dinner, my SIL (24f) was there too. We started talking and then suddenly she told me a piece of gossip about a friend, let‚Äôs call her Lisa, of mine (who was just an acquaintance of my SIL). Apparently Lisa told another friend of hers, let‚Äôs call her Alex, something very private about herself. And then Alex told another‚Ä¶..until my SIL heard it and told me. I was really shocked when I heard it but I didn‚Äôt react further. 

A few days later I talked to Lisa and told her ‚ÄúI heard this and that about you. You need to be careful who you tell your business to bc they tell other people.‚Äù
My friend immediately knew it was Alex who shared her secret bc she only told Alex about it. Lisa confronted Alex. 
Alex figured out that Lisa must‚Äôve heard it from me and I must‚Äôve heard it from my SIL, which was correct. So Alex then confronted my SIL and apparently there was big drama, idk the details.

So, I‚Äôm six months pregnant and my SIL, who I was very close to, suddenly stops talking to me. She never asks me how I am. I was in the hospital bc of kidney stones while pregnant, never checked up on me. Literally nothing. And my emotional pregnant self cried about it like everyday for the last 2.5 months of my pregnancy (at first I didn‚Äôt understand why she acted that way bc my pregnancy brain couldn‚Äôt connect the dots). And as I said, I always used to send her pics of like new baby stuff I bought bc I shared my excitement with her and then suddenly we were like no contact. I even cried to my husband about it multiple times but there was nothing he could do either.

And finally, when my baby is like a month old, she comes over and makes this big speech while crying and saying how she trusted me and everyone was mad at her and how could I. I was like ‚ÄúHello???? You were part of a group of people who shared such a private thing about someone and I‚Äôm the bad guy??‚Äù I was going through postpartum hell and she made it worse.

So, AITAH? Should I not have told Lisa? 

At this point, I‚Äôm never going to forget how she treated me during my pregnancy and I never wanna be close to her again. I just wanna know if I was in the wrong."
amitheasshole,AITA for expecting to be repaid money owed when my friend is in a bad situation,248,2025-03-30 13:36:00,34,"

A friend of mine, who for years had been 100% reliable, always had my back, whose word could be trusted, let me down recently, and I have been accused of being unreasonable in my attitude.  I was also accused of letting money change me as a person, talking s*** about her behind her back, taking sides between her and another person, and I‚Äôm sure a number of other things I‚Äôm not even aware of.  

For several years, I have been friends with this person and her significant other. She was my best friend, but he was also a good friend as well.  He works as a handyman, and has been doing some work on my house in his off hours. They have a young child who is at the end of a three year long journey with leukemia.  For starters, she apparently has literally started war with him, because of their personal problems as a couple.  She also seems to be expecting everyone they know to take her side in this argument that is not the concern of anyone other than the two of them, and something only they can work out between themselves.  

A while back, I helped both of them out financially, but separately, what each of them owes me is on an individual basis - in other words there is an amount he owes, and there is a separate amount that she owes.  He has been repaying his part, he and I are still on good terms, and like always my friendship with him is separate from my friendship with her.  To explain the situation a little better, they share a child, they are sort of together, but live separately.  

She seems to expect as loyalty to her for her friends and family to treat him like a subhuman creature.  I don‚Äôt take sides in other people‚Äòs issues., and I won‚Äôt have anybody telling me how to treat another person, because it just isn‚Äôt right.

Meanwhile, she owes me over $2000 and refuses to pay me back, refuses to even speak with me, etc.  Because I won‚Äôt do as she asks, and take her side in her problem with her relationship.  Back in February, she insisted that I do her taxes and was expecting a large enough refund to pay me back.  In the past, she would have done so.  But this year she did not pay me for doing the tax return. (I am an accountant.) as well as refusing to pay me the money. She owed me when she got her refund.  Came back at me with I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre stressing me over money when you know I don‚Äôt even have a home.  My feeling was whose fault is that?????  

I am essentially being accused of being a total and complete asshole, among a few other less complementary things!  So tell me am I really being an asshole by taking up for myself and expecting a person to do what they said they were going to do????"
amitheasshole,AITA for waking my mum up?,0,2025-03-31 19:30:36,5,"I (NB 20) am a full time carer for my mum (48 F). She's come home from a rehabilitation centre,  the kind for physio and help with that kind of stuff after she recovered pneumonia.

We've had to have extra support workers on especially overnight to assist her which is a new temporary thing. 

On some weekends I'm a drag performer at clubs which means I don't get home till 2 or 3 am and I know some people can be very judgemental or even nasty about it. 

Here's the part where I'm not sure if I'm the A-Hole. I wanted my mum's help to talk to her workers who are doing the nights I have shows cause I'll be coming home in full drag during their shifts overnight. We discussed early in the day to let the night shift know and mum's been sleeping all hours so it's if something is needed wake her up. I woke her up 10 minutes before the worker got here and by the time the worker got there she was asleep again which left me with the awkward conversation.

This morning I asked her if tonight with this other worker can she please try and stay up those ten minutes please to help me talk to them and she got upset and defensive with me over it. We clearly discussed talking to the workers about this together as I don't want any safety issues due to this (I've been attacked before for being in drag).

Sorry if this is really rambling.

amitheasshole,AITA for fixing my mom's bike?,0,2025-03-31 19:12:29,4,"I'm telling this story on behalf of my friend, Jack, who is the narrator of the story. It should be noted that this happened 10 years ago, and no animosity is held anymore, just some reoccurring spats about who was more justified in their anger. When I heard this story I, like many of you, wanted to give my 2 cents (which was not very appreciated) but I was given permission to share this with you all so you can decide who was TA once and for all.


>My(15) friend, Greg(13), rides bikes competitively, and for one reason or another, did not have his bike for an upcoming event. Greg asks me for advice, and I remember that my Mom(47) has a bike sitting in the garage that she hasn't touched in over 20 years. Without asking Mom, I tell Greg that he has permission to borrow it. Greg tries it, but finds that the bike is not rideable; a number of the parts are broken and need to be fixed. Greg takes it upon himself to use his own money to buy the new parts and repair the bike. Greg uses it for the biking event, but when it comes time to return the bike, Mom finds out and is furious we took it without asking her. I understand I was wrong for this part and apologize. Mom demands that all of the old parts are put back on the bike. I explain to her that the old parts are broken and these new parts fixed it, but she doesn't care and wants the old broken parts back on the bike, essentially making it unusable again. This angers me, that she essentially wants her bike turned into junk. In addition, Greg, not knowing that he never had permission to take the bike at all, had already thrown away the broken parts because they were, well, broken. This infuriates Mom and it in turn infuriates me. We get into a massive argument because I feel like she is being ungrateful that we fixed her bike for free and she wasn't even using it to begin with. AITA?



I'll go ahead and add mom's side, which is that she is upset fundamentally that, yes, Jack took the bike without her permission, but also that Jack permanently changed everything about the bike (she is speaking primarily visually) without her knowing. I will also add that in *current times* she explains that part of the reason for her anger was because she loved that bike for sentimental reasons, and she didn't care whether it worked or not, however **at the time** she did not give this as reasoning and only said that she was upset that it changed. This was also not known by anyone else at the time either.
Jack also wanted me to mention that she hasn't touched the bike since the incident.
So what's your guys' take?


Just to reiterate, Jack knows he's TA for not asking for permission in the first place. Where you all come in is whether or not Mom should be grateful or rightfully upset at the state of her bike at the time.
Hope this wasn't too confusing.

(YTA = Jack is TA.)

She reassured me that someone else would pay it, no one ever did. So I got stuck with the bill. I‚Äôve been paying roughly $100/month for this woman‚Äôs phone. My step mother has never worked a day in her life, she doesn‚Äôt clean, she doesn‚Äôt cook, she has never contributed to anything. I ******* hate the fact that I‚Äôm paying a freeloaders cell phone bill. Every time she says something to me I want to look her in the eyes and tell her to get a job. She‚Äôs not on disability and she likes to say that she works with my father, I‚Äôve seen her go to work with my father‚Ä¶she sits on her effing ass the whole time!!! My money situation is pretty good during the summer but during the winter I have to cut my expenses to almost nothing. And anytime I talk about how money is tight she gets worried that her cell phone will get turned off‚Ä¶like WTF!? I‚Äôve been thinking about putting her phone on a separate branch and saying FU take care of this shit yourself‚Ä¶AITAH?

EDIT: thanks everyone, you have all helped ease the part of me that feels bad for no damn reason!! I have spoken to everyone involved, no one has fought me on my decision and they all support me. Once her phone is payed off I can take her off of my account which I will be doing.

The story is a lot more involved for everyone asking for more info. The most important thing is that I have taken steps to fix the situation.

amitheasshole,"AITA for ""making holiday times miserable"" because my husband surprised me with take out",2,2025-03-31 18:12:23,36,"Throwaway as I know my son uses Reddit.

Background: I've (55F) been married to my (60M) husband for 3 decades. I'm a stay at home mom. We are Muslims.

As you might know, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk for a month. Mother's Day here falls on March 21st, concurrent with Ramadan. I had prepared an extensive meal for the entire day.

My husband return from work with takeout food,a surprise for Mother's Day. I started boiling. Couldn't he have called and informed me prior? He is aware of how much kitchen work tires me out with my deteriorating health conditions.

The kids had already started eating the takeout while I stayed in the kitchen. My daughter noticed that I'm peculiarly not seated, told her to go back to the table and continue her meal. I stayed in the kitchen eating the meal I've worked my buttocks off and snapped out. Shouting from the kitchen about how he's inconsiderate. He shouted back.

The following day they ate the leftovers (not exactly leftovers as the food as only I touched it). I tried eating it. But I got up as the food simply couldn‚Äôt be reheated. I opted for some fruits. We shouted back and forth again.

Nothing major happened for a few days. He would sleep on the couch or together in bed quietly here and there. Our sleeps didn't intersect much. But because of unrelated reasons because of the nature of Ramadan prayers and his work schedule. He did not apologize, feel the need to apologize, or express some sort of remorse. Like previous fights, we both would shut up and move on.

Flash forward to today and it's 2nd day of Eid (Islamic holiday). For the first day, we went/dined out together with the kids. Though, we would, instinctively, split into groups or just avoid chat whhen together. The kids are passive. Maybe it's a Gen Z thing and they want to avoid uncomfortable conversations, but they were just in their own worlds. I cannot blame them.

Now it's second day of Eid and he wants to visit his brother's side of the family. ~2 hour car trip. It's a tradition that we visit them. For the 1sr time, I refused to. Helps our case that we do not have a big enough car to comfortably seat every one of my kids anymore. We replaced the big car with a less gas intensive car after our eldest son moved away (he's here now for the holiday). Though the kids could have just gotten over it for the ride.

Suffice to say, I dont want to see my in-laws. He called me a piece of shit that makes environments miserable and drive down everyone's spirit even in festive times like Eid. Wasnt bothered and stayed crafting this pot. Then made sure the kids are dressed nicely. As I'm typing this, they're at my in-laws. My daughter texted me that he was ranting during the ride. And the kids were just quiet and hoping he would also be quiet. He told them if anyone asks why I'm not there, just lie and say back pain."
amitheasshole,AITA for not opening the door to unannounced family visitors?,6575,2025-03-29 18:58:01,687,"Where I'm from, people visit each other without any previous communication. The ""host"" then has to stop everything they are doing and receive them, specially if they are from the family. I believe it's disrespectful to visit someone without justification and/or a previous agreement, I know it's a culture of the country but for me, it's like the visitor is saying ""I know you have nothing better to do so just drop it all and attend me"", disregarding any work or chore I may be doing. 

I've made it clear to my family that I'm strict with this, and even if I'm just watching a movie, playing videogames or looking at my cat, if you didn't take the consideration of notifying me in advance, it doesn't matter if you are a few blocks away, coming from a different country or from Mars, if you didn't text or call me in preparation to your arrival, you will be left outside, doors shut. 

A few days ago, my mother told me a cousin of mine came from a very far away country, and he was going to my house in two days. I warned her that I wouldn't be able to receive them because I would be working (I work from home), plus, I didn't wish to dedicate any time to them, because my cousin didn't give me the dignity of knowing he was coming to the country beforehand, I didn't even know he had been around for like a week. 

I told my mother DO NOT come, I will not open the door, I'm really sorry but no. Long story short, they came to my door anyway. I saw my mother, father and cousin in the security camera and heard them calling me. I let them sit there under the sun for half an hour until they gave up and left. It's incredibly important for me that my word is respected, if I said don't come, my wishes need to be respected or you'll be left outside. I love my family and friends but they need to respect me, this I show up first and tell you later culture is way beneath me. Am I the \*\*\*hole for enforcing this personal rule?

Before this, some family members also came from abroad and surprised me with a call saying that they were on the beach and for me to go. I'm not 9 years old, plus, I didn't even know they were nearby, you can't just ask me to go to the beach a weekday in the afternoon, please dignify me by planning in advance, it's not that hard. Of course, I declined the invitation and politely let them know why I won't just drop everything and go to the beach with them. AITA?"

amitheasshole,"AITA for confronting a ""friend"" for telling me at the last minute that she doesn't have enough room to take me to the concert we've been planning to go to for months.",437,2025-03-30 08:59:09,38,"Firstly, I am new to this sub so l apologise if the structure of my post is confusing.


I(18 M) am an International student who moved to the UK a few months ago. I recently (January
2025) became friends with a mutual(F 18) who connected with me through one of my friends and we started hanging out. She asked if I was interested in going to a concert (April 1st) with her because we realised we listen to the same artist.
We had been planning to go to this concert since February and came to the conclusion that we'll be travelling together to go to the concert. Moreover, our plan was to stay with one of her friends (18 F) (whom l've never met) at her accom. During the last week of February, I asked her as to how we'll be travelling together to the city since that is far away. She mentioned that she will either ask her uncle to pick us up or we can travel together via the train. However, she reassures me saying that we might need to have this conversation someday else because the train timetable was unreliable at around that time and that she wouldnt be comfortable using the trains because that wo be expensive for her as well. We mutually agree to this. Time passes, I keep mentioning it repeatedly throughout the month and she proceeds to dismiss me saying that she will ask her mother to drop us. A few days ago, l initiate a conversation about the travelling situation and she responds to it saying that her mom agreed to dropping us to the city. So I message her yesterday, asking her to make a travel plan with me. However, she sends me a text telling me that,

""I dont think my mom can take all of us cuz my brothers are gonna be in the car too.""

I respond with,

"" so am i supposed to go alone or smth ?""
""Couldve told me a lil earlier, no?""

""Thought we were supposed to go together.""

""Its lowkey a lil weird since ur asking me to travel to a new city, alone?""

That's all, shes hasn't responded to me. I still haven't confronted her yet l am planning to) but I just wanna know if I'm in the wrong here. I know that she isn't obligated to take me there but the entire city is foreign to me. The concert is in two days and the Train-tickets are super expensive now. Moreover, the concert ends at around 11 pm and I have nowhere to crash. I genuinely don' know what to do since this is very last moment for me."
amitheasshole,AITA for not supporting my bf how he wants,11,2025-03-31 05:54:17,16,"Sorry this is long. My bf and I have been together for 1.5 years and discussed marriage and family in depth and have both said we want a future together. We do not live together but spend almost every day together and have talked about what living with each other would look like. 

Lately he has been going through a hard time with his family as his father has fallen very ill and requires round-the clock care.  This has changed our dynamic and I‚Äôm understanding of this bc I understand wanting to be there for his family and he is primary caretaker for his dad. 

This is where we keep finding ourselves in a repetitive argument. My bf wants me to be more active in caring for his dad. However, he is dismissive of any advice or suggestions I give. Bc of his dismissiveness I‚Äôve been planting seeds for some things which need to be done as I‚Äôve noticed outright telling him these things makes him defensive. His dismissive attitude is also resulting in me not offering my help since he‚Äôs dismissive of things I say. I don‚Äôt think he can have it both ways, he either wants my help with everything and takes my suggestions into consideration or doesn‚Äôt ask me for help. I would like to point out there have been times when I offered a suggestion and his response was this is a ‚Äúfamily matter‚Äù which is why I say he can‚Äôt have it both ways. He can‚Äôt want me to be family only when it‚Äôs convenient. And quite frankly I‚Äôm not his fianc√© or wife take on these duties. I also don‚Äôt think it is fair he can decide that he can use my physical help but will disregard anything I say.

Each time this argument comes up I think we‚Äôve come to a resolution but it keeps popping up. I assume it‚Äôs bc he‚Äôs all over the place and overwhelmed,but I can tell he‚Äôs in a lot of pain so think maybe I AMTA. However, I‚Äôve asked him to tell me exactly what he wants me to do when he needs help and he thinks that‚Äôs a ridiculous ask and that I ‚Äúshould know and offer‚Äù. This is why I‚Äôm frustrated bc if he asked I would be willing to help or do what he needs but he expects me to just know. I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm not a mind reader, tell me what you need when you need something. 

For more context, we both have full time jobs and are in our mid 30s. His father has been sick for almost 3 months. After work, I workout and he hasn‚Äôt had the opportunity to workout in almost 3 months. I‚Äôve told him working out is my stress release and I want to get back to my routine as this was put on hold when his father first fell ill. I understand he wants my help but I‚Äôm not going to take days off of work (unless it‚Äôs an emergency) or continue to skip the gym to sit at his parents home and waste time. I want to support him and am willing to do so when he asks. I think he‚Äôs unreasonable for expecting me to just offer to do things when idk what needs to be done. 

AITA for not just offering help everyday? Should I just drop by his parents house and ask how I can help or wait till my help is requested? "
amitheasshole,"AITA for not saying goodbye to my sister or her kids when I moved out, and cutting emotional ties?",1,2025-03-31 17:38:37,3,"
I (29F) was close to my sister for 8 years. We aren‚Äôt biologically related, but I considered her family. I supported her emotionally, helped raise her kids, and was always there‚Äîeven when things were hard.

During the pandemic, she was in and out of the house‚Äîgone for weeks at a time with her boyfriend, then back again. My mom and I stepped up to care for her kids. We used my mom‚Äôs money and later some of my government assistance to feed them and make sure they were okay. I didn‚Äôt expect a thank you, but it still hurt that there wasn‚Äôt one.

Later, she got with her current boyfriend. He started off loving and supportive, but after she miscarried, he changed. Their relationship became rocky‚Äîshe was crying more, clearly struggling, and I tried to help. But she stayed. One night, he came into the house at 3 a.m., blasted loud music, scared the kids, and when I asked him not to slam the door, he got in my face and threatened me. She later brushed it off, saying he was drunk.

What hurt me most wasn‚Äôt just what he did‚Äîit was her response. No checking if I was okay. No apology. Just her going back to saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and laughing with him like it never happened.

My mom (who owns the house) started eviction proceedings in November. My sister hadn‚Äôt been contributing anymore. I helped with the paperwork. She blames me.

I moved to a new state in February. I didn‚Äôt say goodbye because I knew I‚Äôd stay if I did. I needed peace. Now she‚Äôs calling me fake and telling her kids the same. I never said I wanted her out of my life‚ÄîI just needed space and boundaries.

AITA for stepping away and not saying goodbye?

amitheasshole,AITA for not giving into my sisters ultimatum,48,2025-03-30 19:56:47,21,"My sister and I have always had mutual friends, but over the years, I noticed a pattern‚Äîpeople often fall out with her, and I tend to follow suit, even when I‚Äôm not involved. She has great qualities but can also be emotionally immature, draining, and sometimes toxic, especially with close friends, family, and relationships.

She expects unconditional loyalty, even if it was her choice to stop being friends. Recently, she had a falling out with a mutual friend who was a bridesmaid at my wedding. I didn‚Äôt think it warranted ending the friendship, but she demanded I do the same. I tried to explain that while I support her, I don‚Äôt think I should be forced to cut ties. She called me horrible names, sent me hurtful messages, and ultimately gave me an ultimatum: drop this friend or be get out of her life.

I love my sister, and our relationship is important to me, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to be forced into this choice. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling someone‚Äôs unattended child to stop disrespecting our home,0,2025-04-01 00:58:39,14,"im 18f, have a 19 month old child, and i live at my stepmothers with three of my siblings. right now one of my other sisters is visiting from my moms. my siblings thatre all currently here are 10f, 8m, 5m, and 3f, almost 4. the 3f sister A, has a neighbor friend, E, the same age as her. 
me and my stepmother (36f) were inside cleaning and i was taking care of my toddler. 

A and E are both very smart kids, talk well, they get into fights. they were fighting outside while my 10F sister was out with them. i made my sister give E her coat back. after that, A came back inside. E kept trying to bust in the house. banging on the door, while A was blocking it crying telling her she doesn‚Äôt want her in. at this point E‚Äôs mother isn‚Äôt in my view, idk where she is, likely downstairs. we live in an apartment, and my stepmom has already told E she can‚Äôt come inside. i asked A if she wanted to play and A said no. 

now here i MAY be wrong, i used a pretty big word she may not understand. i got on her level and told her that she ‚Äúwas already told she‚Äôs not allowed in, my sister doesn‚Äôt want to play, she needs to stop banging on our door and trying to break in. it‚Äôs not okay to disrespect someone else‚Äôs home. M (my stepmom) is cleaning and doesn‚Äôt want anyone over right now.‚Äù

now i more so meant disrespecting rules, i tried to effectively get my point across. my voice was stern, not mean. but her mom came up and told me i was being rude. and angrily left with her kid, before i could say anything. i don‚Äôt think i was rude. her kid has come over and my stepmom has almost yelled at her over how bad she doesn‚Äôt listen. she screams loud and whines and doesn‚Äôt listen to ‚Äúno.‚Äù now yea they‚Äôre toddlers but i know with the amount of siblings i have, not all of them act so entitled. i‚Äôve grown up with a lot of kids. E has personally pissed off my kid and fucked with him til he cries (she means well, but tell her no repeatedly), so honestly im not a fan of her. i was already having a bad day as my stepmom was arguing with me about something. so a little kid fucking with my sister and trying to shove herself into a house she‚Äôs not allowed in was irritating. i didn‚Äôt yell, didn‚Äôt swear, didn‚Äôt call her child anything. my stepmoms only idea is i maybe sounded too stern and used too big a word with the child (disrespect), but said her mom probably didn‚Äôt see the whole ordeal, and maybe i was right. so what do u think cause now im mad as that‚Äôs the first time some kids mom has called me rude while handling their child, and i feel it was totally unjustified.

amitheasshole,AITA I‚Äôm starting to feel like the mean girl,5,2025-03-31 07:19:10,10,"My closest friend/coworker and I are not as inclusive as our other friend/coworker would like. 

I‚Äôm a bartender and to anyone who has worked in the food service industry, relationships come on fast, they come on strong, and you pretty much read who you‚Äôre gonna vibe with immediately. I‚Äôm a year into this new job in a new city and was initially open to almost any friendship at my new job. I hit it off almost immediately with a coworker (let‚Äôs call her Rachel) and we were hanging out after work most nights. One of the other girls at our work would join (let‚Äôs calls her Monica) and we became a group of girls‚Ä¶ tale as old as time. However, over time Rachel and I got closer, we started doing things together that didn‚Äôt have anything to do with work. Finally, Rachel and I decided to move in together. Monica got jealous and wanted to live with us. 

Between the two of us Rachel and I have four cats. This became a good excuse for not wanting a third roommate after Monica expressed desire to live with us. After needing an excuse for not wanting to live with Monica, Rachel and I started to analyze our dynamic with her. We realized Monica is actually quite mean and insecure. It‚Äôs little things and little comments and giggles even when it‚Äôs just you and her. It‚Äôs so weird when she comments and laughs at you when it‚Äôs just you two in the room, like who is your audience? We all work together 4/5 days out of the week and she‚Äôs obviously aware that we‚Äôre pulling away. In response she‚Äôs been demanding to be included? I don‚Äôt know how else to put it? We include her in the ways that feel natural but are reaching a point we don‚Äôt even want to be friends with her. She wants to be included in every conversation and wants to be privy to every bit of information we share with each other. Last night we had a one on one conversation where she said she has never felt more left out of a group before and was saying she was hurt we didn‚Äôt share information with her about our personal lives. I told her that if she keeps pushing us she‚Äôs probably going to get answers she doesn‚Äôt want and that right now we‚Äôre happy to be her friends to the extent we exist now. I feel like the asshole because I don‚Äôt think she has a lot of friends and while I can see why,  I also see how she‚Äôs fun and cool. I just wished she‚Äôd let us be friends as much as feels natural, it feels like we‚Äôre in 3rd grade and it‚Äôs mean to not invite her to every sleepover.

amitheasshole,AITAH? Told my girlfriend not to use my electric face razor on her vag but she did anyway.,2251,2025-03-29 21:54:55,749,"So long story short, in the past my gf (me 27, her 26) admitted to using my razor on her coochie. I told her to never do that again and even gave her my old electric one to use. Fast forward to recent and I found out she used it again. Along with that, I have been telling her for months to stop showering without the fan on or door open a bit as it‚Äôll cause water damage over time. Well, at the same time of finding out about the razor, she had made the bathroom walls wet with water again and I blew up a little bit. She has a hard time taking any criticism and has a hard time admitting fault so this went over not too great. Now a week or so later I was asking where something of mine was and if she possibly used it. Her response was, ‚Äúwhy do you always assume I‚Äôm using your stuff???‚Äù I threw back, ‚Äúsays the person that was asked to not use my razor on her vag yet she did anyway!‚Äù Now for the first time she has decided to go spend the Saturday on her own instead of having me come with. I‚Äôm not worried we‚Äôre drifting apart, however I don‚Äôt want these things to keep happening without change.

For reference the ONLY thing we really bicker about is chores and who has done what (I really wish this would stop but we both keep on keeping track). We have also been together for about a year and 2 months. Any ladies or anyone else out there have any advice on how to get my lady to see my point of view or how to get her to be more reasonable to admitting fault/not being defensive all the time? Thanks."
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my gfs cousin if she can‚Äôt park her car in her spot that it‚Äôs not my problem?,170,2025-03-30 11:56:11,53,"I 24(M) and my gf 23(F) were given a car for pretty cheap (around 800$) by my gfs parents since they just got a new car. We live in the city area so usually the only spot to park is on the side of the road on a hill outside of our house, but we have an alleyway behind our house with 4 cars parked there. For context it‚Äôs a double sided house with one side being my gfs parent‚Äôs side and the other side is rented out to her aunt. When my gfs parent‚Äôs offered us the car my gf wanted my opinion on if we should take them up on the offer. I said yes but only if we can have a parking spot in the back because I do the driving for me and my gf and it would be more convenient. They agreed but we had realized that as it was no other car could fit in the alley for parking unless they made room for our car. So we did just that and shifted the cars around and had made room, but then my gfs cousin that lives next door also 23(F) started freaking out and said she didn‚Äôt have a place to park. We went outside and there was clearly a spot about 1 and a half the size of a normal parking spot but she refused to park there and was throwing a massive fit over it saying there was no way her car could fit. I told her if she‚Äôs not able to park her car there then she had to park in the front on the hill and that it wasn‚Äôt my problem she couldn‚Äôt park since there was clearly enough room and even bigger cars could have parked there.(We tested it with a bigger car and it had fit in the spot) She then began demanding that we move our car so she could fit hers even though her car could clearly fit. We said no and that if she didn‚Äôt park crooked it would fit and went inside and this really set her off. She then began texting my gfs dad and mom telling them it was their fault she then started messing my gf to fight with her and they all blocked her. But the same night she used WhatsApp to make 4 different numbers to harass my gf all night. So am I the asshole?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my child's father see her until he pays child support?,0,2025-04-01 02:03:53,76,"So like the headline states am I the asshole? This dude owes almost 19k in cs and I use to let him pick her up and drop her off to school (not everyday just once a week) but I think I am going to block him from her ipad so he won't come anymore. My child has an amazing life with just me and I make decent money for just us two. Ofc the help will be great if I had it but I don't. So now I plan on blocking him to have communication with her via ipad because I feel like it and because he shouldn't be able to just do whatever he feels like it. 

Btw there is no visitation ordered by the courts. 
So I'm not violating any mandatory visitation rights. 

Edit: I know I didn't give much info on the original post so here is more. Child is 8 years old , I took him to court for child support when she was 4 after him not wanting to contribute financially for her. By the way he never showed up to court to cooperate. I have her on my health insurance, I pay for all her expenses including extracurricular activities. He comes in and out of her life when he pleases. He talks to her via her ipad. He doesn't call/txts her everyday just when he wants. Last year he only made an attempt to see her maybe like 4 times. He has been inconsistent with her since she was 2 years old. When he does see her he only spends 20-30 minutes with her because then she wants to be dropped off. Sometimes my daughter ignores his calls and I ask why and she just states that she doesn't want to talk to him. He gives her junk food when he sees her because I don't really give her that kind of food. He doesn't even know what size she wears or the names of the teachers that she has.  He's absent most of her life wouldn't that be emotional abuse for her to have to deal with that?"
amitheasshole,AITA for calling my dad out for excluding me and my brother from family activities?,8,2025-03-31 04:11:38,23,"
I (18M) have been trying to spend some one-on-one time with my dad (46M) for a while now. I‚Äôve asked him multiple times if we could go camping or fishing together, but he always either ignores the request or makes excuses. Today, he decided to take my stepbrother (16M) fishing instead‚Äîthe exact thing I‚Äôve been asking to do with him for ages. It really stung, especially because I feel like he‚Äôs been prioritising his new family over me and my biological brother (17M).

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve felt excluded. A few nights ago, my dad told me I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have dinner with him and my stepmom‚Äôs family. This led to an argument where I told him he couldn‚Äôt keep disregarding me and my brother in his plans‚Äîwe‚Äôre his kids too. My stepmom (45F) ended up stepping in and saying we could come, which I appreciated, but it still hurt that my dad didn‚Äôt want us there in the first place.

For context, I really like my stepmom and step-siblings, and I don‚Äôt have any issues with them personally. If anything, I‚Äôm more jealous of the attention my dad gives them. I hate feeling left out, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting. AITA?

Update: (1)

Hey everyone, thanks for all the comments and perspectives. I wanted to give a quick update on what‚Äôs happened since my post earlier today. Instead of sitting around feeling bad, I decided to keep myself busy‚ÄîI worked out, distracted myself, and eventually went to the store to grab some snacks. I figured if I couldn‚Äôt get one-on-one time with my dad, I‚Äôd try to bring everyone together instead. So, I set up a movie night with my dad, my brother, and my stepfamily, and honestly, it helped a lot.

I also wanted to clear up a few things because I know my post probably made my dad seem like a terrible father, and while what he did wasn‚Äôt okay, there‚Äôs more context to it:
	1.	This is his first serious relationship since divorcing my mom back in 2011, so I can understand that this whole dynamic is still new to him.
	2.	He‚Äôs also on the spectrum, which means he sometimes struggles with social cues and may not always realise when he‚Äôs excluding people or handling things poorly.

I‚Äôm not saying these things excuse his actions, but I do think they play a role in how he handles relationships and family time. That being said, I‚Äôm still trying to figure out if I‚Äôm just making excuses for him or if I‚Äôm being too forgiving. Either way, I appreciate everyone who took the time to respond."
amitheasshole,AITA for flirting for food after 8 years of giving him the cold shoulder?,0,2025-04-01 04:53:28,33,"I'm using my friends account because I'm not on Reddit. 

I 34(F) bartend at a local bar in a remote area. We get the same people everyday. One local guy is kind of a man whore and the dating pool here is so abysmal that he's basically hooked up with everyone in town, but whatever that's not my business. He relentlessly hits on me and tells me he's madly in love with me every single day, though and I always roll my eyes and turn him down. There are hardly any restaurants here and basically all of them except for the one I work at are closed for the winter.

He is from Mexico and I love Mexican food but the closest Mexican restaurant is over an hour away. The other night he offered to bring me homemade tamales from his t√≠a and my stomach overrides my brain so I said ""yes please!!""

He ended up bringing chicken and ribs instead but that was good enough for me!! The next night I jokingly asked him what's for dinner tonight and he brought me some delicious Tinga! 

He has not taken the hint in the last eight years and I have realized and accepted that this is my reality for the forseeable future, possibly for the rest of my life, so AITA if I give him a glimmer of hope and send him that Snapchat message asking him ""what's for dinner tonight?"" because I know he will continue to bring me food. It is not only benefitting me, but also my friend/coworker who has had to deal with his drunk ass everyday for the last eight years as well.




Edit: Just to clarify, he is bringing the food to my job that he frequents multiple times a day while my friend and I are working. Also, I have never flirted with him once in eight years and tell him on a daily basis that I am not interested and never will be. The only thing my messages say is ""What's for dinner tonight?"" I only mentioned his promiscuity to explain why I would never be interested. I don't want to hook up with someone who has banged half my customers. #toocomplicated"

Me

M (my friend bfs wife)
K (M‚Äôs best friend) 
B (our 9month old)

Back story I am not from Wisconsin but my bf is. C and J have been friends since middle school. J and M are highschool sweethearts. K and M have been friends for about 2 years. C and I moved here 5 years ago. We are the only ones with a kid. I have had to tell M and J in the past sometimes I just don‚Äôt feel like snapchatting. Nothing personal I just don‚Äôt feel like I should have to talk to my friends every single day to keep a friendship. Now J doesn‚Äôt like K. Complains about her to C and I all the time.She‚Äôs always negative, trying to start drama, complaining that she‚Äôs not getting enough dick Ect. 

Fast forward to Thursday, B is being extra difficult and I leave them on read on snap. I don‚Äôt think anything of it. Friday happens and we are supposed to have dinner with C‚Äôs dad, J and M. We all get there and M doesn‚Äôt talk basically the whole time. We go to leave and C asks J what their plans are and if we can come over. J shrugs and says to ask me. I‚Äôm talking to C‚Äôs dad not paying attention. C reasks do you want us to come over or not. J says  it‚Äôs up to me and I‚Äôm acting like out ex roommates. (a story for another time, they were absolutely horrible). C tells me this once he gets in the truck. We head to their house. 

I chat a little with M she holds B and I chat with J and test out his dirt bike because I want to learn to ride. We go inside to play card games and drink. M gets so drunk and isn‚Äôt talking to me the whole night. It‚Äôs midnight and we go to leave and J tells C if we need help with the carpet on Saturday to let him know and they will come help. 

Around 11 on Saturday C snaps J and says we are gonna start soon and J says he made other plans that they are working on his truck. That‚Äôs cool we can do it ourselves. I text M around 3 saying that if when they get done with the truck they can come over and we will order pizza. (We eat out all together Friday and Saturday and they come over on Sundays for spaghetti) M texts back they are working on the truck all night. I just say okay!

Now we all have each others locations. Have for years. K is now over at M and Js house. K all of a sudden removes her location only from me not C so I do as well. 5 pm comes around and they all drive up 40 minutes away to a restaurant that C and I picked out 2 weeks ago and they kept saying no it‚Äôs too far. But I thought they were working on a truck all night right?! Nope M just lied to me. Around 11pm Saturday night J and M remove their location from me as well but not C. And then proceed to not come over ok Sunday for dinner or talk to me  

Not once have they communicated what is wrong. They are literally ruining a friendship because I didn‚Äôt snap them back. I know for a fact K was talking shit with M otherwise the locations wouldn‚Äôt have been turned off."
amitheasshole,AITA for not helping mu colleague,1,2025-03-31 15:18:04,5,"Hello Reddit! Help me out please, I'm not especially feeling guilty aboit this situation and therein lies the problem. I am a ""patient and helpful but after that it's malicious compliance or outright assholery"" kind of person. 
I work at a well-established international company, that has well-established practices, regulations, yada yada that haven't been observed ever, because our boss is an excellent salesperson, and as long as the money keeps coming in everything goes...except now we got bought from a proper owner, that wants to follow proper procedure (which would bring in more money for everyone, but would make our director's life harder...you know, actually working instead of saying ""make this happen"" and the team actually making it happen). 

I quit my role as supervisor because I felt the expectations were unreasonable, there were procedures that we weren't following and I got scolded demeaned, or outright insulted for not performing well and not meeting our director's unrealistic demands (calls to my personal cell at 6/7 am in the morning, Sundays, vacations, etc). I asked for a different role in the same company (I'm actively looking for another job), and a junior colleague took over my position, even though we warned her of how it was probably going to be (toxic as fuck). She received next to no training from our supervisor, even though I volunteered to oversee the shift and help her, I got the ""it's not your place, I will teach her from the height of my experience"" by our supervisor, so I went not my monkeys. 

Today she came to ask for help (after more than a month of her asking for help) on a matter that we have a procedure for, that people were not following, and I told her straight up ""I didn't quit this role to keep being dragged in, and to have to babysit old superiors that refuse to learn new tricks. It's not about you but you have to stick to your guns and tell them that you want the procedure, because I refuse to help and I shouldn't be one they call upon when they get stuck."" I told her multiple times I wasn't angry at her specifically, because she is very sensitive, but I stood firm, adding that ""I'm sorry, but I told you this is how it was going to be, and I don't want any part in it."" 
I could have easily helped, easily told her what to do in the ""old"" way. AITA for not doing that?"
amitheasshole,AITA IF I DONT TIP AT RESTAURANTS ?,0,2025-04-01 05:46:38,2,"Okay so I was listening to hey, we read Reddit stories podcast and it was an episode about how a guy goes to a restaurant to tip $100 at the end of the day to impress his day and goes back and changes his $100 tip to a $20 tip and they go on about how they think. People who don't tip are assholes so it has me thinking am I really that big of an ass for not tipping for context clues, my view on tipping is pretty much what the general idea is of people who don't tip. I just don't think I should considering the fact that a person who is serving the food is already getting paid. Yes, I understand that they're dealing with people on the day-to-day basis and I also understand that some people survive off tips but my thing is is that why did you accept that job? If you know the pay is s***** or why does it fall upon me to give you extra money when you're already getting money for the service that you do? I mean don't get me wrong. I can see why I should, but I'm more on the side that I shouldn't and not that I can't afford to tip. I just don't want to tip because I don't see any value in doing it if you guys have any questions that you want to ask me to see where my mentality is at for it, go ahead shoot. I'll try to do my best to answer everybody but I just need to see it. Am I really that big of the a-hole here?"
amitheasshole,AITA to want to end my friends toxic friendship,0,2025-03-31 18:35:50,4,"My friend group consists of 6 people but who are important is A and G (17) and since about yr10 a new girl (D) joined our class and she was to be nice, awful! Towards the end of yr11 we have GCSEs in the UK, what we kind of have only found out now is that G did have a crush on D at some point. D has a boyfriend M throughout this entire time. Anyway exams cause G a LOT of stress and G has autism so didn‚Äôt react in the best way. But after G kind of blew up in front of someone else, D said she wanted space etc and annoyed G but only speaking to G when she wants something. Come to results day and G gets a message from M telling G to stay away from Ms girlfriend and the only way he could have gotten her number was from D and he was fuming with this.

Come to first day of yr12 G was speaking to D like nothing had happened. For the rest of the first term D and M must have broke up and got back together at least 3 times, and whenever she got back with M or broke up with M, D always said to only G ‚ÄúI want space‚Äù and only expects him to leave her whilst she‚Äôs fine with everyone else. Now I don‚Äôt know if G did ever ask D out to be Gs girlfriend so that could mean a whole different range of stuff. As the term went on D and G had many falling outs and me and A, had to put up with this drama happening and try to be supportive for G. And whenever D said she wanted space and distanced herself from only G, D is the person to start speaking again. Anyway end of the first term, D asks a teacher for the equivalent of a restraining order and didn‚Äôt want G to speak to her for 2 weeks as she ‚Äúneeds space‚Äù. That didn‚Äôt go well with G and he got quite annoyed and me and A kind of wanted this to never happened again as this caused a lot of stress on mine and A‚Äôs part as we had to cope with this drama

Cut to this term after 2 terms where G says they were ‚Äúacting civil‚Äù with D Does acting civil meaning when you‚Äôre walking with your friend and say hold and has a full on conversation with D ‚Äúto keep the peace‚Äù. But we had a careers fair last week and for some reason G went around for the thing with D, M and one other ‚Äòfriend‚Äô, who is far too controlling. Now A had an exam that day so didn‚Äôt get to go and I was with our friend group which G is a part of but went off round with people who actively make him miserable and stressed. But today me, G and another girl in our friend group was walking around school and we went past D and he went off and spoke to her and I said to my other friend why do we have to go through this again. A then confronted G about it and how me and him have kind of had enough and we kind of don‚Äôt have the energy to go on with it, which G got annoyed with but made up later. G then spoke to D at lunch

Now me and A want to stay friends with G but we cant continue having the same issues again with D being a toxic person to G and G still speaking to D and I want to just stop G and D from speaking to each other for his sake and mainly for mine/As sanity. AITA"
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I tell my child actor friend he's an asshole with an ego?,16,2025-03-30 23:09:10,29,"I 17M go to a public high school with my child actor friend 17M who I will call J from now on. I've known J ever since 6th grade, so roughly 5 years. J is no where near an A-list celebrity, so please dont go speculating on who he is, but I know for sure people have seen him on screen whether they know it or not. He was on very prominent TV shows during the 2010s, but has been focusing on his studies recently and not acted in a while. 

J has always been a little weird, not a social outcast, but a little socially awkward. He can't really read the room and always butts into conversations that has nothing to do with him, I dont think he's on the spectrum but he is a little weird. Sometimes we're standing in a group and talking to my friend about a show that J hasn't watched, and the whole time J is just ""yeah i have no idea what you're talking about"" or ""i love being part of this conversation"" in a sort of ""pick-me"" way. One time I asked J about a friend that I hadn't heard from in a while and J responded in a joking tone with ""yeah he's in the hospital for overdosing on ibuprofen."" Obviously like any normal human I was shocked and concerned, but J just played it off as if it wasn't serious.

Recently J has been getting a bit of an ego. Somehow after every test he takes he has to let everyone know that it was extremely easy. And after our recent test he said ""yeah i got 100"" about 30 times. He kept on doing this because no one acknowledges him because of how annoying he is. And god forbid that you complain about anything because his life is 10x harder. I would say I'm so tired I only slept 4 hours and instead of responding with ""dang that sucks"" he says ""oh yeah? i get to school at 5am and leave at 10pm, im so tired all the time"". Which I don't doubt that you're tired but you chose to do that, you chose those classes and just because someone does less than you doesn't take away their right to be tired. He always needs to 1-up you, no matter what. Just a few weeks ago J was telling everyone how he got into this summer yale acting program that is extremely exclusive, which is awesome but the way he brings it up out of nowhere comes off as a 3rd grader telling everyone he drives a lambo. Then he says ""yeah jodie foster wrote my letter of rec, yup that actually happened"". Getting into this yale summer program has just made his ego shoot through the roof. J just goes around saying ""yeah im gonna get into yale"". Which I think he has a really good shot at, but it's just so insanely inconsiderate the way he says it to people. He has some sort of superiority complex that needs to be addressed. Its getting to a point where me and my other friends don't want to be around him or talk to him.

I've been thinking on telling him about this for awhile. I just don't know how he'll take it. On one hand he might just think I'm joking and not be serious. Or he could get absolutely pissed and be really confused and claim that he doesn't act this way."
amitheasshole,AITA for over explaining something to a friend?,0,2025-03-31 17:32:28,23,"To start off, I have Asperger‚Äôs and don‚Äôt always notice social cues. This definitely affected the situation. Also have ADD though that played a less big part.

Basically a friend of mine was drawing (digitally) and I was talking to them over discord.

I happen to have just completed an education where I get a lot of drawing classes. Therefore also a lot of tricks that make things easier to do. I was trying to explain to him to draw an eye if he wanted to he could copy it (he already did that himself before I tried to say anything)

What I was trying to help with is explain he could use the warp feature to make it have more perspective. Unfortunately turns out it‚Äôs really hard to explain that over voice only. He did say multiple times it was fine. But I took this as me not explaining well enough.

Suddenly he sounded mad and left the call. I realise I definitely ignored him telling me to stop. Multiple times. But when I‚Äôm passionate about something I just really wanna help and I didn‚Äôt notice.

I explained all this to him. Feel really shitty about it. He as still not responded to the message. Tbh I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about that. I know I made a mistake but I didn‚Äôt realise I did. If I didn‚Äôt care about him I‚Äôd have never bothered trying to explain this or message him after to apologise and explain why.

Tbh I do feel he owes me a response at the very least. We have been friends for years but him doing this is making me feel even worse about the situation. I also already wasn‚Äôt doing great mentally and it‚Äôs just really got me down right at the start of the week.

Am I the asshole? "
amitheasshole,"AITA for exposing guy who in secret chat insulted, ridiculed and made gossips about someones?",0,2025-03-31 13:37:35,6,"Recently my best friend betrayed me. Main story started with it. 

I'm friends with Donald(fake name) since school days. We always helped to each other and always trusted to each other. I always helped him with guestions that need intellectual skills, and he helped me with guestions that need social skills. I really trusted him, he always was sayin that he forever will be human and never be asshole as society. Couple days ago me no way wouldn't believe that he would betray me, because i thought even in critical situation he can be last hope. 

Previous year we joined one collective. I also joined, because that organization had money and same targets as mine. They're collective in my city was toxic, but they're superiors(they're in other city) can finance mine projects, because we had general priorities. 

One day i showed myself, my skills, and guys noticed me and i joined organizators club. In organizators club was only some guys from collective and leader of our city(she's not superior). And in that organizators club was girlfriend of my best friend. 

But one problem, while i tried to develop our project, our collective, organizators in secret chat only made gossips about other members, made ridiculous stickers from their photos. Donald's girlfriend also did, but she also ridiculed her boyfriend. I readed it. But i didn't answer. I just decided to show it to Donald. Before it, Donald gave promise that he won't share about it to nobody. 

Donald break his promise and he send our chat correspondence to general chat where there all of our collective. And he told that is me the one who send it to Donald. 

I got expelled from organizators club and everyone from that club, started to hate me. And there was guy Roman(fake name). He was number one of spreading gossips. In my screenshots that i gave, was his messages too. 

One day i came to our place. And in night, when i leaving that place, some guys from our collective stopped me and brought me to back of the multi-storey buildings. I was in clean clothes, so i wasn't wanna fight. But they're afraided that i could write a witness statement, so they're didn't beat me. But Roman told me not to come to our collective, but if i will, he beat me with guys who brought me here. 

I think Roman just couldn't take responsibility for messages that he send and blamed me for all guilts, because i exposed him. 

I think my big mistake is that i trusted to my best friend. 

Am I The Asshole? I exposed guy who spreaded gossips, but i was in secret chat where i wasn't shouldn't to do it. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not paying for my mum‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day lunch?,17,2025-03-30 22:33:59,12,"A few days ago I found out my siblings and parents were going out for Sunday lunch for Mother‚Äôs Day and we (me and my partner) got invited. My brother organised the lunch, I mentioned we already have something planned for mum for Mother‚Äôs Day next weekend so we‚Äôll pay for ourselves and he said that‚Äôs fine, he wants to pay for her and dad as a Mother‚Äôs Day gift anyway.

Move forwards to today - we go for lunch. It‚Äôs nice! We get to paying and my sister says let‚Äôs split it 3 ways (also, my brother and sister both have 2 kids each, so their meals are also included in the bill). I say oh I think we‚Äôre just paying for ourselves. My sister is astounded and presses the matter. We are kind of surprised she is on the attack and just say again we‚Äôll pay for our meals. We‚Äôre packing up and sister says loudly ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want to pay for mum and dad so we‚Äôll split the rest then, that‚Äôll be nice for MOTHERS DAY‚Äù. I was surprised, didn‚Äôt say anything, we paid for our food we all said goodbye and left.

I messaged my sister afterwards explaining we thought brother wanted to buy the meal for the parents, we‚Äôd pre-discussed the situation with him, and I didn‚Äôt love how she was all passive aggressive about it. She has absolutely not apologised, and essentially said oh well we wanted to pay for mum and dad because of how much they do for us. Bearing in mind that we have an entire day of fun planned for my mum next weekend. I also messaged my brother saying I didn‚Äôt mean to cause drama with the bill. He says the same as my sister, despite having previously said he wanted to buy them the meal himself as a gift. Mum also got involved and has said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll discuss at the weekend‚Äù. Am I missing something? I really don‚Äôt understand why they all seem so disgusted by the fact that we paid what we said we would? 

For context normally a very conflict free family, which is why I‚Äôm so surprised by this."
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my mom borrow $200 of my commission money for a trip I don't want to go to?,7,2025-03-31 03:49:53,18,"I'm a 17 year old artist from the Philippines, so $200 is a lot (it's roughly php10k). My mom (51) is the holder of my PayPal account, which means she can do whatever she wanted with the money in it. Of course, I told her not to touch it without me knowing. 

So now I have around $200 in my PayPal account. I was with my mom when she asked if she could borrow it  for a trip we'll be going on in around two weeks. Of course, naturally, I said no since I wanted to have money in my PayPal so I could use it for subscriptions, donating, etc. She said that she'd pay me back in two months. Reasonable, but again, I didn't want any money to be moved out of my PayPal, let alone all of it.

I said no, because in the Philippines, it's hard to cash into PayPal as it is not widely supported here.  She insisted because we were going on a trip and didn't have any ""pocket money"". After explaining my reasonings, she conceded and said that I would have to do everything myself (my laundry, cooking, etc... she never taught me these things properly lmao).

  
Honestly I kinda feel guilty but it was the money I worked hard for and wanted to use for other reasons, especially for my upcoming trip to Paris for a competition. AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITAS (21F) for asking my boyfriend (3OM) to pick up after himself even though I stay home?,8,2025-03-31 02:13:44,45,"I handle most of the household chores, except for taking out the trash (since we live on the third floor and it‚Äôs often too heavy for me). The issue is, about 80% of the time, after I‚Äôve cleaned the kitchen to perfection‚Äîdishes, counters, sink, oven, sweeping‚Äîhe ends up making a big mess. When I go in the next day to do the dishes, the kitchen is in disarray: paper towels left on the counters (he doesn‚Äôt even try to throw them away), wrappers, non-perishables scattered around, and even the hand towel ends up on the floor. This isn‚Äôt just a kitchen problem; it's similar throughout the house, though not to the same extent as the kitchen is a high traffic area. 
Over time, I‚Äôve gotten discouraged. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve cleaned less because of it. 

We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half, and this has always been the case. I‚Äôve tried to communicate with him, but the conversation either turns into an argument where he says things to me I don‚Äôt wish to repeat or he says he‚Äôll try to be better about picking up. Unfortunately, the behavior doesn‚Äôt change. Recently, he told me he doesn't care to keep things clean or pick up after himself because it always messy anyway. But I‚Äôve explained that even when I consistently clean, the mess still happens.
Am I wrong for asking him to clean up after himself? He does pay for everything, and he often surprises me with small gifts or snacks, which I truly appreciate!! 

However, I feel that while I am happy to contribute by cleaning and cooking, it‚Äôs not my responsibility to constantly pick up after someone who is fully capable of throwing away their own trash. To me, this feels like a blatant disregard for my time and effort."
amitheasshole,AITA for not applying to MIT,9,2025-03-31 01:27:56,13,"For context, my parents both never went to or applied for colleges, both of asian immigrant families who came to America at young ages. I'm their first-born daughter, and just went through the first college admissions cycle ever, applying to 6 UCs, 3 Cal States, and 17 other colleges (I never wanna see the words status update ever again).   
  
It was going well, and their lack of support didn't really prod at me until I kept getting into really good colleges (Cal Poly Slo, NEU, BU, NYU, SDSU) and all I got was 'wait for the ivies'. They were so overconfident, that for Ivy Day they prepurchased a 'congratulations' cake, thinking my two interviews with Dartmouth made me a perfect shoo-in for it.   
  
Anyways, Ivy Day, waitlisted at Cornell and rejected from the 4 others I applied to, did not care because day before I got into NYU. I got what I wanted.  
  
Only, my dad found out I didn't apply to MIT like he wanted with the other schools he told me to apply to. With me still crying about the Cornell waitlist because it was genuinely such a surprise, he went upstairs with a scowl on his face.  
  
Him and I are both incredibly stubborn people, and there's been mutual ignoring each other for three days now (our biggest streak was a straight week). I don't exactly see a way to fix this, but just need help because everytime I try to talk about it with him, I freeze up because he gets hostile or aggressive with his tone.

There's usually the midpoint where I just break and all I want is to talk to him, and yesterday I reached it because it was prom and he obviously did not care the slightest, in the photo him and I took we both look so tense with each other. That just made me more stressed about it, even if he was somewhat friendly when he met my boyfriend for the first time, thank god. 

I just don't know where to go from here. I know nothing changes with I'm, it never has. I'm about to go to college in four months, and don't know how to go forward with this. 

I know it was selfish of me not to apply for MIT amongst all the other colleges he forced me to apply to. But I was scared -- all he talked about without letting up was how he'd force me to go, and I know how spoiled of me to say that about MIT lest I would have gotten in, but I genuinely cannot play this game with him anymore. I'm tired of this, and I can only take this routine for so long. 

How can I go about this? I know visiting the colleges I got into is probably out of the question, and I'm trying to give him a few more days to cool off, but how do I go about?"
amitheasshole,AITA For telling my brother that his friend is too rich to share our account?,0,2025-03-31 19:18:42,24,"Hey guys throwaway here cuz I don't really have an account. So a bit ago I was on call with my friend and he was talking about a game he wanted to play on his ps5. I told him why doesn't he share it with us (ps5 game sharing is basically when u get an account with a game that u don't have and u put that account on ur ps5) and he said he can't because one of my brothers friends is also sharing and if more than one person shares then it will kinda fuck up the ps5 which has happened before to us, so I told my brother if his friend (17m we will call him Blake no not his real name) can stop sharing and he said no so I got a little angry and told him why not it's not like he needs it as much and my brother said no he asked first and I told him that he literally is 20x richer than us and he can just buy a ps plus card on his own and my brother got angry and said that an inappropriate thing to say and I told him that he's right but it still is true and also we/me play with the other friend more than he plays with the other friend plus that friend kinda has done more and has been nicer to us than Blake. And Ik that's not something nice which is why I didn't mention that but everything I've said it's true and he told me something which is kinda fair but still not fair which is I should ask Blake to stop sharing. Now for context Blake is 17 I'm 13 and my bro is 17. Also me and Blake don't really get along well he kinda thinks I'm the annoying younger sibling and I used to really like him but now I don't really care about him. So with that context I said can't u just do it and say that I said so and my brother said no which I think is dumb because he is 5 yrs older than me and finds me annoying kinda so he probably wouldn't even listen to me so we kept going back and forward until he said that he doesn't care unless I tell Blake he isn't doing anything and that's where we are at rn. It's not like a huge argument we are still playing laughing and showing each other things but I kinda need a solution which is why I'm here I wanna Inow if j crossed the line and my brother is right or am I in the right and my brother should tell him.

amitheasshole,AITA for blocking a coworker/friend (32F) on my (33F) social media after they lied to me?,0,2025-03-31 19:14:42,12,"This coworker and I were best friends in this new work place that we both joined together in this new city. 

Back story is that I have maintained a lot more friends than her both at the work place and outside of the workplace (this becomes relevant later). 

We've been friends for a few years now, and while we are seen as close friends, I keep her at an arms length because she does tend to attract drama, but I also didn't know how to leave the friendship without it causing conflict at work. 

Right until last month, we organized an event together and there was an issue with a guest coming (her friend) that I didn't want to come. So I asked is she's actually sure if she wants the person to come and she did say she doesn't actually like her never knew how to say no. 

So we worked together on a plan, and I told the guest that the plans have changed, and everyone was on the same page. Me and my friend were happy that the unwanted guest was not coming. (I did say that  the guest can come if she really wanted her but I will then not come).

Come around the event, guess what, the guest and my friend both show up together. 

And that's when I realized I had fallen trap to one of having been lied to.

Everyone at this event is from work and the ones seated next to me asked me who the new person is and I told them it's a person that's not supposed to be here. 

Things were awkward but  cordial for the entire night. I went home quite disappointed that I've been lied to, so I decided the friendship needs to stop. So I blocked my friend. 

I thought that would be the end of it as I had moved on afterwards with the rest of my life. 

But the friend had then messaged my coworkers telling them I've blocked her and that I'm sharing around this story and that it's causing her to feel isolated (I've only told what happened to one person after that dinner). She then told the coworker that she's reported me to management. 

The coworker, in their own time wanted to fact check by asking some of the other people if I have spoken to them about anything, to which all of them said no because I obviously didn't speak to anyone else about this. 

The coworker showed me the text conversation they had with her, and she's blatantly lied about everything.

Hearing this make me reassured that I did the right thing to remove myself from blocking her. But the mutual coworker is saying that blocking someone is a bit intense.

Am I the asshole for blocking someone after I realized that I cannot have a conversation with them without them lying to me? 

Additional asshole question, would I be an asshole for reporting this incident to my management/HR for slander? Especially if she's contacted my coworkers and blatantly lied about my character and the incident in retaliation of me blocking her? 

My coworker says that she feels threatened that I have more friends than her, and that me having blocked her is going to isolate her if and when people find out what happened, and that she's doing what she's doing because she's scared about what might happen.

amitheasshole,AITA for not consulting my sister-in-law to schedule my wedding in 15 months?,1190,2025-03-29 21:00:56,468,"AITA for not having my wedding based on my SIL's schedule?

I (26F) am a Canadian living in Germany, with my German fianc√© (27M). We have been together for 6 years and we are planning our wedding to be in summer 2026.

My MIL & FIL are both doctors and my SIL (25F) is in med school. My family is from a regular middle class background, we are not doctors, we don't have fancy cars or expensive hobbies. My fianc√© and I grew up very differently. My SIL has never had a full-time job, she drives a luxury German car, has her [second] horse, has all the latest Apple products, and her rent completely paid for by her parents.

My in-laws are completely estranged from their families ‚Äî MIL doesn't talk to her siblings or parents, they ""kicked her out of the family"". My FIL also doesn't talk to his mom or his brother, claiming them to be toxic. Therefore, my fianc√© has no ""real"" family in Germany except for his immediate family: mom, dad, sister, and by extension, the sister's boyfriend.

I have a big immigrant family in Canada and a lot of friends. Our international friends have all expressed enthusiasm to travel to Canada for the wedding. I moved to Germany to be with my partner. My partner and I are planning the wedding over 16 months in advance to (1) save up enough to pay for it ourselves and (2) ensure that all the people important to us can come. We know it is a big ask for our non-Canadian guests (mainly friends, as no family aside from the immediate were gonna be invited). Last week, we signed a venue contract to secure our date in July 2026. We mentioned to both our families that July was our target month as it's a beautiful time in Canada and after the FIFA World Cup.

After signing, we made a Save-the-Date graphic and sent it to our immediate families + closest friends (max. 10 people so far). My family was thrilled, my MIL's first response was: ""Why didn't you consult us and your sister first? That's during her exam season."" A few days later, my in-laws decided to cancel their stay with us (we live in different German cities) and said they are offended by our actions for not consulting them on the date and have now decided not to go to our wedding in Canada, to be in solidarity with their daughter, who may have an exam on that date. My SIL's exam schedule is not released until mid 2026. 

My partner and I are paying for this wedding ourselves. My in-laws are also threatening to ""kick my fianc√© out of the family"" because we are ""selfish.""

My in-laws will be in town next week and want to set up an ""appointment"" to discuss this and how the ""family will move forward."" 

Are we the assholes in this? Should we change the date because my SIL *might* have an exam during this time? BTW the wedding date is on a Saturday and money is no issue to my in-laws. My partner and I are completely financially independent from both of our parents. 

This wedding is taking place 15 months in the future."
amitheasshole,AITA for ruining my friend‚Äôs birthday?,4,2025-03-31 03:18:20,6,"I (F22) was invited to my longtime friend‚Äôs (F22) birthday party, planned two weeks in advance. The night before, my ex-boyfriend texted me. I‚Äôve been struggling with this breakup (a 5-year relationship filled with lies and cheating‚Äîmy first serious one) and have been going to therapy every Tuesday. Since the party‚Äôs lunch portion fell on a Tuesday, I decided to prioritize my mental health and attend therapy instead. I let my friend know about my ex reaching out but didn‚Äôt check my phone that morning, as I usually isolate myself when triggered. I planned to join the second part of the celebration.

I admit I should have given a heads-up, and I apologized. However, when I arrived at the party with two other friends (who had informed her in advance they‚Äôd miss lunch), the energy was tense. Birthday girl was cold and distant, barely engaging with us. During cake cutting, she made a rude comment about not saving a slice for another friend who missed lunch due to work, which surprised us since that friend is always accommodating.

Later, she sent the working friend a passive-aggressive text saying she wouldn‚Äôt wait for her. When asked if it was rude, we all said yes, but she dismissed us with, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my birthday, wouldn‚Äôt you feel this way?‚Äù

As we left, our friend NB friend (22)asked about the lunch again, and that‚Äôs when everything exploded. Birthday girl lashed out at me for ‚Äúghosting‚Äù her, despite my apology. She ignored my explanation about my mental state and the difficult breakup. Another friend (F22) defended me, emphasizing how much I‚Äôve been struggling. Birthday girl snapped at her, saying she ranked lowest in our group and then, out of spite, announced she wouldn‚Äôt attend her birthday. This upset my friend, who then left.

Left with just birthday girl, her cousin, and NB, the atmosphere was unbearable. Once we got away, NB and I discussed what had happened. The friend who had left called me in tears, upset about how unfairly I was treated. Later, our group (minus birthday girl) met up and shared frustrations. Then birthday girl texted us, acting passive-aggressive and saying I ‚Äúchose a man over a friend‚Äù and that we didn‚Äôt prioritize her. This was unfair since we always accommodated her in past hangouts.

Finally, she asked for space, saying she wanted to spend the rest of her birthday with her mom, so we left her alone.

So, am I the asshole?

So i got a little mad and i was trying to eat my food and watch tv at the time, she then started saying how lucky i was to have a mother and started to joke about how she‚Äôs the best mom.

amitheasshole,AITA trying to get out of parking spot outside of a busy NY hospital street,7,2025-03-30 23:48:59,10,"Welcome.

Context: Manhattan, NY. Outside hospital.¬†Picking up sis.¬†[Drawing of scene](https://imgur.com/a/VNzWmMF). If this double parked car was not there, I have enough space to just turn out left without reversing since there is ample space between me and the front car.

Tried honking/flashing a few times. Nothing. As soon as I approach the driver side, the driver rolls down the window slightly to say ""reverse, your car can reverse"". The lady is in the driver's seat and holding a baby. I ask her if she can move forward a little bit because I rather not reverse since I would have to go into the pedestrian sidewalk and avoid the turning cars to get enough space to go around her. But she replies back that she isn't doing nothing because she has a baby in her hands, which she does. At first, I was a little confused because how did she drive over here in the first place with the baby and suddenly now she refuses to move because she has a baby in her hand. I look in the back and there is no baby seat (mandatory?) or any other person; so I ask her how did she drive over here then. Later upon reviewing my dashcam, there was a young teen that was in the back seat that left as I was waiting, I guess he was holding the baby? But at that present time, I did not know since I was not focusing on that. But, she replies that she's holding the baby for the mother (never saw prior) and repeats me to ""reverse because cars can reverse"". She ignores me and just repeats ""reverse"" to me, which at this point, I just say ""well that's stupid"" and head back to my car because I figured she ain't changing her mind. But as I head back to my car, this lady runs after me out her car with the baby out screaming that I disrespected her by saying ""that's stupid"".

Ironically, a second woman (I'm assuming the actual mother) came from what looks like a few cars above us and grabbed the baby as the first woman (driver) came to follow me with her phone to take picture/video of me as I already sat in my car to try to move. She goes on saying look at all his space, indicating the crosswalk, for me to reverse. Funny, her reaction to doing this, actually helped me because the pedestrian and cars stopped moving because she went behind me to take picture/video of proof that there is space and that she does not have to move. Her making a scene allowed me to reverse back, basically taking like 1/2 of the crosswalk before being able to go around her car.

As I'm going around, my sis tells me that the actual mother who took the baby, went to another car. So, I guess that driver was delivering the baby? I thought NY was illegal to drive with a baby in the car without a baby seat. Couldn't she technically have placed the baby in the seat (if had) and moved?

AITAH because I could reverse and pull out but by going onto the busy crosswalk and street of a hospital in order to get around her? Should I have not even bother to speak with her and just attempted to get out in the first place? Thanks, have a good day/night."
amitheasshole,AITA for buying my wife a vacuum for her birthday?,0,2025-03-31 18:39:50,12,"To be fair, I did not buy the vacuum. However, she let me know the vacuum that I bought is not good enough because it is heavy and must be plugged into the wall. It was a suggestion of mine that I buy her one. We could have his and hers! It could be so romantic. "
amitheasshole,AITAH for maintaining a boundary with my parents?,8,2025-03-30 23:20:12,18,"My son just celebrated his first birthday this month and my wife and I have had a consistent boundary in place since he was born of no kissing him.
My side of the family is naturally very affectionate - with typical Midwestern goodbyes every visit and all babies and kids in the family getting kisses on the cheeks, top of the head, and being encouraged to give kisses to grandparents and aunts/uncles etc.
My wife‚Äôs family are NOT naturally affectionate and frankly quite reserved. My wife already felt uncomfortable with my family‚Äôs naturally high level of affection since we started dating. My wife largely feels like spit transfer from others kissing my son and then her kissing him is just kinda gross. She also feels like it‚Äôs important that our son has autonomy over his body and gets to choose when to be affectionate and with whom.
ANYWAYS, my parents texted me a few days after attending his first birthday - asking to confirm if they could love on him with kisses on cheeks yet (not on the lips of course). They brought up the fact that our dog licks his face frequently (conveniently ignoring that we tell our dog to NOT lick him on his face EVERY. TIME she tries!). Also they thought something might have changed since my son has started going to childcare during my SAH wife‚Äôs exercise classes during the week.
I said that nothing has changed, but encouraged her that our son knows that they love him no question and he certainly loves them in return.
They responded by asking to have a conversation to ‚Äòshare their heart‚Äô and ‚Äògain understanding‚Äô - going as far to ask if they had done something wrong to push us towards keeping the boundary up past our son getting all his vaccines and his one year.
I confirmed that they had done nothing wrong and that the no kisses was just what we had decided was best for my son.
They responded back saying that they WANT to honor our decision even if it‚Äôs different from how they raised me.
THEY WENT ON to ask if it was a decision just for my son‚Äôs infant years - into his toddler years or beyond? Adding that they wouldn‚Äôt want him to feel like he is receiving less love than my nephew is from them - since they want to love their grandchildren all EQUALLY.
I responded that we were not putting a timeline on when we would change anything on our stance - saying that we see their love for my son as just as intentional as their love towards my nephew.
As a final note - a side concern my wife and I share is that opening up this boundary with my parents means the entire extended family would now smother my son with kisses and expect physical affection whenever they please - the expectation that we see them have with my nephew. 
I just don‚Äôt fully trust that they would honor his autonomy and feelings.
So, AITA for maintaining this boundary? 

Edit: Three minor clarifications in response to some great feedback: 1. By ‚Äòno kissing‚Äô we don‚Äôt mean ‚Äòno contact‚Äô - family is free to hug, snuggle, carry my son around and have him sit on their lap - we are only asking for them to not kiss him anywhere - especially his face and mouth. 2. The boundary has become an issue because my family has a history of conveniently ‚Äòforgetting‚Äô to not kiss him throughout his first few months and not respecting me in the past or as a new dad 3. My wife and I agree that we don‚Äôt want to raise our child with the same lack of affection she had. We are super affectionate with our son - we both kiss him all over, hug, snuggle him, my wife exclusively contact napped with our son until very recently, and still does for one of his two daily naps, and we three cosleep together all night. Many thanks to all üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è"
amitheasshole,AITAH for having the cops at my dad‚Äôs house while I move out?,6,2025-03-30 23:10:03,2,"My dad (57M) has never liked my significant other and can‚Äôt give me a reason why. Three days ago he kicked me(30F), my 8 month old daughter and my husband(35M) out after an altercation between my dad and husband. Two days prior to this my dad threatened my husband‚Äôs for something I did and assumed my husband did not hear his threats. Then, two days later makes one of his shitty remarks at my husband and all hell broke loose. Things did not get physical, but they were about to before I stepped in between. My husband threatened my dad and we were kicked out. 

9 months ago, just before I gave birth my dad begged us to move from another state and live with him. He wanted us to have time to save some money and get our bearings as new parents. I was reluctant knowing my dad and how abrasive he is and didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea. He insisted things would be fine and we decided to give it a chance knowing how helpful it would be to not have rent looming over us as we welcomed our daughter. Since we arrived, my dad has been nothing but rude to my husband. Without diving deep into the details this has left my husband feeling extremely uncomfortable and walking on eggshells to keep the peace. At 6 month postpartum my husband agreed to quit working and instead let me go back to work, which I really wanted. He was going to stay home with the baby and after a few months we would move closer to his parents (who are retired and would help us with childcare) so that we can both work. About a month ago, we let my dad know we‚Äôd be moving out and relocating 2 hours north where my in-laws live. This caused a really big argument between my dad and I, where he called me names and told me it was my fault he would have to sell his house (keep in mind we haven‚Äôt been paying rent, despite every attempt every month we‚Äôve been there to give him money). Since then, tension has been growing. 

My dad has always made quite a bit of noise when my daughter has been sleeping. She is not a great sleeper as it is & we‚Äôre up every 2 hours with her all night since birth. Needless to say my husband and I are exhausted and over him waking her up. 5 days ago, at 6 am, he is in the kitchen slamming cabinets shut and woke the baby up. I start work at 6 am & usually my husband will take care of all the babies needs while I‚Äôm working, even though I‚Äôm home. The baby is quite particular at this age and wants me to do the soothing. So, I had my husband move my mouse in the office while I put her to sleep. The noise continued and I hit my breaking point and slammed the door. This set my dad off and he was screaming threats towards my husband assuming he slammed the door.  When my husband heard these threats he wanted to leave immediately. After fighting with him all day to bide our time and stick to the plan for moving he agreed he wouldn‚Äôt say or do anything towards my dad. We were going to leave in peace. 

Until, two days later my dad made a shitty comment at my husband and my husband came unglued. My dad expected me to leave my husband then and there for disrespecting him in his house. Because I told him that was out of the question & stated that he made threats first he made me and my daughter leave as well. He gave me 45 minutes to collect my things and leave. So we left. 

Today, I let him know we‚Äôd be by Saturday to get the rest of our things and asked if he could leave for a couple of hours so that conflicts didn‚Äôt continue. He told me he wouldn‚Äôt let me get my stuff with my husband‚Äôs help and he was not welcome back in the house. Then he told me that because I won‚Äôt leave him, it was my fault we‚Äôd no longer have a relationship and he wouldn‚Äôt have a relationship with my daughter. I told him that I would be there on Saturday with a police officer and will collect whatever I can in the 15-30 minutes allowed. 

Keep in mind my husband is a very kind and gentle man. He has never been abusive towards me, never made me question his loyalty and until a few days ago has never been disrespectful towards my family. Hell, I‚Äôve never even seen him be physical or aggressive towards anyone until then. 

I‚Äôm very hurt with my husband for going against what he promised me and haven‚Äôt shared much words with him in a few days. However, I understand there‚Äôs only so much one can take before they lose it. Regardless, his actions did lead to this. 

That being said, I‚Äôm having a hard time forgiving my dad for kicking me out like that with an 8 month old baby. For him making threats to begin with. And ultimately for the cruel things he‚Äôs saying and doing to me. 

AITA for threatening to have the cops there? Is it on me that our relationship is now tethered? That he will not have a relationship with his granddaughter? I‚Äôm so heartbroken right now and I‚Äôm worried that maybe it is my fault. "
amitheasshole,AITA for not being more supportive after a friend's cat died?,12,2025-03-30 20:06:24,41,"My husband I have a good friend (all 3 of us are in our 30s) who's a certified Cat Person. About 2 weeks ago, he had to put one of them down. A sad day for sure, but it wasn't a surprise- the cat was something like 15 years old and had a lot of health problems. He called my husband the day of, and we both expressed our sympathy over the phone. He pretty much said yeah, it was a bummer, but at least she wasn't suffering, and that seemed to be the end of it.

Yesterday was the first time we saw him in person since then, at another friend's engagement party. Full disclosure, I was not at all thinking about the cat- it was a fun night, and our friend seemed perfectly fine and like he was having a good time to me. Then, after everyone had gone home, he sent an angry group text to me, my husband, and 3 other mutual friends who'd been at the party. Basically saying that he was really hurt nobody asked him about the cat, or asked how his other cats are doing, or gave him a condolence card or anything.

Reactions in the group chat were mixed. One friend clearly feels really guilty, one told him he was drunk and being nuts.  My husband thinks he WAS being a little extra about it, as is his wont, but we should have been more supportive. He wants to invite him over for dinner one night this week as an apology. I have no problem with that because I feel bad our buddy is upset, but I don't feel like any of us did anything wrong. (Who tf gives condolence cards for a cat??) I just want some neutral third party perspective on whether we messed up here. "
amitheasshole,"AITA for helping my niece "" gang up "" on her dad?",374,2025-03-30 01:02:44,175,"I 36f was dropping some things off for my brother 41m at his house today and I stayed to visit for a while with him and my niece 13f. 

There have been plumbing issues with one of their bathrooms so my brother, niece, and SIL 40f have all been using the same bathroom and apparently my brother has an annoying habit of leaving the seat up. 

My niece came out from the bathroom upset because her dad had left the seat up again, she started complaining about how he always leaves the seat up and how annoying it is, I could relate to this because my husband 38m frequently leaves the toilet seat up at our house. 


So I agreed with my niece and pointed out how my husband leaves the seat up to and how annoying it was for men to do that, she seemed to appreciate my support and she talked about how annoying it was when her dad leaves the seat up. 

We got a little too into it and turned to my brother and ( In a joking silly way ) asked him "" is the toilet seat just too heavy for you men to lift ? "" "" Is it ? "" And we then both went ( again in a joking silly way ) "" I bet it is ""  "" yeah "" "" yeah "" ( we both repeated "" yeah "" back and fourth a few times ). Then my niece and i shared a laugh. 

The rest of the visit went okay but later after I left I got a call from my SIL. My brother was very upset with me for encouraging my niece to disrespect her dad, she said that my niece has developed a bit of an attitude lately and it's been an issue for them that they're starting to become concerned about. 

She said they're trying to fix my nieces attitude problem and do not appreciate me encouraging it. My brother and SIL are very upset with me and want me to apologize to him. 

I never meant to encourage my niece to disrespect her dad, I honestly just thought it was a silly thing to joke about with my niece, but my brother and SIL are upset with me for it so maybe I went to far.

amitheasshole,AITA For doing my own dishes?,7,2025-03-30 22:18:54,13,"This has been a constant disagreement between me and my parents forever. Whenever I finish cooking, eating, drinking, etc. I immediately walk to the sink, and wash/dry my dishes. I do this every single time. my son and I have been staying with my parents for the last few years, and this has again become an issue. They will bitch every single time. in their opinion adults should just throw their dirty dishes in the sink and expect someone else to wash it later. the actual core of the argument is that I ""never do the dishes."" and I say I do the dishes every single day. if I make food for me or my kid, I clean up after myself. if my kid makes food he ""attempts"" to clean up after himself, and I clean up after him. the same way I make my bed after I sleep in it, fold my laundry after I wash it, brush my own teeth, etc. 

I think it's fucking insane for my 64 year old dad to make a sandwich and then throw his dirty dishes in the sink, and leave crumbs all over the counter expecting someone else to clean up after him. 

I'm a  37 year old single father. I clean up after myself. I don't wipe my dad's ass after he shits, why would I wash his fucking spoon after he uses it? "

amitheasshole,AITA to not want to live with my sister with my wife,225,2025-03-30 03:22:22,52,"My sister and their partner,  have been together for more then 6 years now and they have had arguments after arguments in their daily day to day lives. My sister would call me whenever she does get in an argument to rant all the time wether is be about the food or not able to do something for him. My brother in law is not a bad guy it's just he's been raised very traditionally men take care of the expenses while women take care of the house, I don't agree with this backwards thinking but you can't teach a dog new tricks. 

I moved near my sister when I got married, new city new things to explore so my partner and I thought it was good idea to be close to family. Everything is going okay for almost a year until at the end of the year all the family went back to your home country for a wedding, most of us returned and my brother in law went for pilgrimage afterwards with his brothers, who also attended the wedding, then went traveling back to their home town. Once my brother in law came back, he was acting very strange like super depressed can't talk properly doesn't eat, and then he says to my sister he doesn't want to live in this city he wants to move back to his home town.  My brother in law asked me to live with my sister with my wife while he's away.  And I said no, I'm not gonna do that.

Let me give you some context, I love my sister but from afar, she's very draining and I can't be myself around her neither can't my partner, we always have to tiptoe around my sister and brother in law because of the age difference and different mentality we have. When we get together once a week sure easily doable. But spending 6 months to potentially 1.5 years I don't think I can do that. 

I genuinely don't know what to do it's been weeks since I said no, and everyone from my parents to my brother saying you have to live with her, but it's easy for them since they are not living with her. 

My wife and I are very happy together, but this situation is pulling us apart she says that maybe she can but if she can't she'll move back to her home town for a bit. Neither of us want that. I want to fix and help everyone but I genuinely don't know what to do

EDIT::
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I really appreciate everyone commenting it really has given me an idea on what to do.

For some context I come from a south Asian family and family is a big thing, so I don't want to continue this generational emotional manipulation, that's why I was asking for advice. I appreciate everyone for your help and my wife was laughing reading these comments I appreciate if thanks guys "

amitheasshole,"AITA for not pouring cereal ""efficiently""?",964,2025-03-29 18:55:28,275,"So this morning, I (21F) went to pour myself a bowl of cereal. Instead of pouring from the box, we keep our cereal in a plastic container with a lid. The lid has a small flap you can open to pour it out, but the opening is tiny‚Äîso you have to shake the container multiple times just to get enough cereal. I didn‚Äôt feel like doing all that, so I just took the whole lid off and poured the amount I wanted in one go.

My dad (54M) saw me take the lid off and immediately asked why I didn‚Äôt just use the flap. I tried to explain that I felt like it was just faster and easier for me to do it this way. He kept insisting that I *could* have used the flap and still gotten the same amount, so I repeated that I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and preferred doing it my way. After some back and forth, he blew up and said, *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit what you feel! You can still get the same amount of cereal with the lid on! This is the more efficient way! Do you not understand that?!‚Äù*

I eventually started crying out of frustration, because no matter how calmly I tried to explain myself, he kept talking over me and accusing me of having an attitude. I said I didn‚Äôt think how I poured cereal mattered as long as I wasn‚Äôt hurting anyone or doing something *really* stupid. He then turned the conversation into *me* supposedly giving him ‚Äúattitude‚Äù and said that I always avoid him or act grumpy when he tries to talk to me.

For the record, I *do* sometimes feel annoyed when he tries to talk to me, but it‚Äôs usually because I‚Äôm in the middle of doing something and he interrupts me‚Äîsometimes even messing with my shirt or trying to be silly when I‚Äôm clearly not in the mood. I don‚Äôt find that kind of stuff amusing, and I just want him to respect my space.

The crazy part? He later apologized and said, *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how you pour the cereal. I just think sometimes you don't want to talk to me.‚Äù* So now I‚Äôm just confused. If you didn‚Äôt care, why blow up at me in the first place?

I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. AITA for standing my ground over something small and not just doing it his way?

**\*EDIT:** I just realized that I'm actually so stupid. The container is one of those plastic ones with a small flap on the lid meant for pouring. I originally took the whole lid off because *sometimes* when the container is full, I find it hard to pour cereal through the flap without shaking it repeatedly. That‚Äôs what I was used to doing out of habit.

But in this case, I later realized the container was actually *almost empty,* so I didn‚Äôt really need to take the lid off‚ÄîI just did it automatically without thinking. I even asked my brother how he pours it, and when I tried using the flap like he does, it worked fine. So yeah, I‚Äôll admit I kind of overthought it in the moment."
amitheasshole,AITA for celebrating that my roommate quit smoking?,1,2025-03-31 07:49:23,13,"This happened a long time ago, not looking for any advice, just some outside perspective. I‚Äôm not even in contact with this person anymore for other reasons. 

So I lived with 2 people who I was good friends with, let‚Äôs call them Angela and Vic. We‚Äôre all in our 20s (me 24, Angela 28, Vic 26). Here is some important context:

Angela and Vic had briefly dated but when Vic wanted to become more serious, Angela shot him down and said that they would only be friends. Like best friends. However, Angela continued to cuddle, kiss, and treat Vic like they were a couple. Eventually, Vic was so uncomfortable he distanced himself to the point that Angela was incredibly upset that he ‚Äúgave up their friendship‚Äù. 

Vic explained he was uncomfortable and needed space, and Angela felt like this was bullshit and that he should have kept their promise to stay friends if things went wrong with their romantic relationship. There was a long time they barely spoke, but during this time Vic was trying to be on friendly/better terms with Angela. 

Here is where I and mentioning Angela quitting smoking comes in. I was close with both, but closer with Vic because we had a lot in common and just got along really well. 

I would be there for Angela when she needed and we‚Äôd be home together at the same time a lot WFH, while Vic had a 9-5 at an office. 

I considered us good friends. She was reading a book about quitting nicotine for good and told me about her progress and when she tossed all her vapes and cigarettes out. She told me about this while another friend of mine was also present, and we were both happy for her. 

One day, Vic and I were hanging out in our living room and Angela came home from a doctor‚Äôs visit. She was in a good mood, ate a healthy snack, and declared she‚Äôd live for a long time. I responded cheerfully that she‚Äôs going to live even longer because she quit smoking, to celebrate her and hype her up. 

About half an hour later, as I was chatting with her in her room, she asked me not to talk about her personal life in front of Vic anymore. I was confused and asked for clarification and she told me that she didn‚Äôt want Vic to know she had quit smoking. She said she wanted to keep  personal details from him and that I should not mention her life around him anymore. 

I was frustrated and honestly didn‚Äôt know what to make of it. I didn‚Äôt really talk to Vic about Angela other than to express I was worried about her sometimes or just basic roommate stuff. I felt like I was being asked to just censor myself around the house. I struggled to communicate that with her and pretty much just stopped talking if all three of us were in the same space. Or I‚Äôd talk to just Vic, since Angela asked me not to involve her life in front of him. Which was weird. She then got upset that I was also acting distant, like how Vic did. 

I really wasn‚Äôt sure how else to navigate the situation since Vic was also my friend and didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong? AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for denying my mom‚Äôs birthday wish?,11,2025-03-30 18:36:36,19,"My mom has been bugging me (25F) about my hair for YEARS.  She can‚Äôt stand that I don‚Äôt really care about ‚Äúhairstyles‚Äù or getting my hair done.  It‚Äôs very fine, thin hair, dark auburn brown, long, and I just keep it flat to my head in a ponytail or simple loop bun all the time.  I‚Äôm starting to get a few white hairs, which genetically makes sense since my dad had almost totally white hair by age 45.  Every year or so I‚Äôll chop off the end of the ponytail to clean up the ends but that‚Äôs it.  I just don‚Äôt care to do anything else, this works for me.  I wear a ball cap almost every time I go out walking my dog or whatever. 

My mom is convinced (and, as mentioned, has been bugging me for years) that I have no ‚Äúvolume‚Äù because I keep my hair sleek and flat, and there is some magic haircut involving secret angles that hairdressers know about that will make me look amazing and stop me from wearing a ponytail.  All I can imagine is old lady hairdos‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just. not. interested.  And she‚Äôs obsessive about my white hairs being ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù to her.  I don‚Äôt want to get sucked in to an expensive issue where I‚Äôm having to spend money on maintaining the roots coming in every two weeks.  ‚ÄúJust be natural‚Äú is my view.

Cut to my mom‚Äôs birthday coming up‚Äî I wanted to get her an ‚Äúexperience‚Äú (something like theater tickets) instead of more clutter or perfume, so I asked her if there was any show she had in mind or what she would like to do.  She immediately LIT UP and said ‚ÄúI want you to get your hair cut... AND COLORED.  I‚Äôll pay!!!‚Äù  I said no.  We rehashed the same argument that has been circulating for years, and I still said no.  I‚Äôm just not into it.  

So now she‚Äôs butthurt, sulking, pissed off, and not talking to me.  I wouldn‚Äôt do this ‚Äúone small thing‚Äù to please her.  Just once for her birthday.  (But I can tell she thinks it will be a new lifestyle from here on out where she won‚Äôt be embarrassed of her daughter.)  And YES a big part of the issue is that I‚Äôve said no so many times in the past that I want to hold the line and maintain my stance.  I don‚Äôt really cave to anyone.  

I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm the ridiculous one (or the asshole) for putting my foot down so that she doesn‚Äôt get her way.  "
amitheasshole,AITA for giving myself a 100 on my groupmate‚Äôs self and peer evaluation form?,26,2025-03-30 14:02:49,30,"So, long story short, this was our final project for the term, and honestly, I think I got stuck with the worst group possible. I (19M) am super grade conscious, and when it comes to group projects, I don't mess around. I actually put in the work.  

There wasn't really a group leader but I stepped up just to make sure everything was organized. I assigned everyone their parts, but of course my group was full of procrastinators who crammed everything last minute.  

Now there's this one guy who was the worst of the worst. He would straight up ignore my messages, which was extra frustrating since we were on a tight deadline. I had to dm him, call him, do everything just to get a response. I was still being patient at first, but by the time I had to call him multiple times just to get him to acknowledge his tasks, I was over it.  

Then came the self and peer evaluation part. Everyone had to score each other and one person had to submit it for the whole group. Since I was basically running everything, I was the one submitting. I gave that guy a low score (but still fair, I was being nice). The deadline was an hour away, and guess what? Everyone submitted their evaluations except him. I messaged him multiple times, both in the group chat and privately. but he was MIA.  

At this point, I had to make a choice. If I didn't submit the evaluation, it would've messed things up for all of us. So, I just did his part for him and gave everyone including myself a 100, just to get it done on time. An hour later, he finally replied and got mad at me for doing it. And I just hit him with, ""You were just gonna give everyone a 100 anyway.""  

Next thing I know, we got called into counseling, and he complained to the professor about it

So yeah, am I the asshole?


EDIT:

Thank you all for the comments. I do take your opinions in consideration and wouldn't complain, cus I do realized It's not right to do it. 

But for more context, this actually happen long before and during the pandemic. It was college, and purely online. I did gave hints to the professor on what was happening with the group during the making of the project, but I haven't received any response until after the due date.  It fucking sucks as most of my groupmates did their assigned tasks on the same day of submission (and I didn't got the chance to finalize and double check everything). Even seeing how that guy submitted the longest and it's been through AI generated answers. And the self and peer evaluation part, it comes with the final project. And, if we do not submit it on time, we have major deductions. 

For those who are saying that I gave everyone 100 in all evaluations. I did not, each of us evaluated the whole group and not surprisingly, everyone gave everyone a 100. (Not me though, I just gave the scores as honest as I could and what they deserved). As for the guy, I assumed he would also give everyone a 100 since why would he care so much to evaluate if he didn't care about the main assigned tasks?

For those who are saying that he has other classes or other priorities, what could be so important when you are inside your home due to pandemic, and note that I always message him during our asynchronous class on that specific subject so he should prioritize our project. 

He also complained to the professor when I gave him the lowest score. But it doesn't fucking matters since he still got 97% on average for the evaluation part since everyone gave everyone 100. 

Ever since, I never saw him again till this moment. 

So yeah, it's so frustrating. But I can see how I can become an asshole too. What do y'all think?"
amitheasshole,AITA for calling my husband a selfish wimp?,654,2025-03-29 19:41:40,275,"The other day I (28F) had a huge fight with my husband (28M). I'll call him Larry for this story. 

Lary's parents were in town last weekend visiting my brother and sister in law and they wanted to see our kids as well before they left. His parents and I have a strained history and have admitted that they don't like me. I have set boundaries with them that they don't like. Despite a lot of things that have happened my husband and I believe that our kids deserve to have a relationship with them and that the strained relationship between us shouldn't affect that. So before they left for the weekend Larry decided to meet up with them at a local Chic-fil-a to chat and let the kids play. 

I decided I wouldn't come so that they could enjoy it. My in-laws also decided to bring my nephew along so the cousins could all play together. 

When my family came home, Larry told me that our nephew ended up peeing his pants on the playground at the restaurant. I cringed and said something along the lines of, ""oh that sucks. Did anyone step in it? Did they get it cleaned up before it got messy?"" To which he responded, ""I don't know. We left without telling anyone. They were closing and no one else was in the playground when we left so my parents didn't think it was a problem to just leave it."" I was SHOCKED! Speechless. I asked him if HE told one of the workers that there was pee up there. He said no, that it wasn't his responsibility because it's not his child. He said his parents were taking care of my nephew not him. 

In past conversations we've had Larry has always been very dedicated to the idea that people should be able to make their own choices in life and that we all should respect those choices, even if we don't agree. In the past I have found this very endearing because I agree that people deserve respect and love despite their path in life. However... this situation made my blood boil. Who leaves pee on the playground without telling anyone?? 

So we got in a huge argument. I ended up yelling at him for being selfish and for caring more about his mothers fragile ego instead of caring about the other kids and employees that will be at that chick-fil-a. I kept calling him selfish and he said I am being an A-hole and not respecting other people's decisions and that I'm just very against him and his parents when they are together. 

His brother and sister in law agree that it wasn't that big of a deal to leave the pee. 

This has been an ongoing battle for a few days now between me and Larry. I've had time to cool off and I feel really bad about calling him selfish but also still feel like I wasn't wrong. He should have told someone right? Or AITA? 

----Edited to answer questions: 
I've been trying to respond to comments but this seems easier. 

-Larry told me it was a puddle of pee.
 
-We haven't been having active nuclear fights for days. We just haven't seen each other much this week because we had alternating work schedules (night/day). We spent time as a family and still felt tension. We both know opinions haven't changed. We just didn't have time to talk about it thoroughly until today. Hence why I said it's been going on for days.

-Larry told me about the pee because he was disappointed in his parents. He told me by saying something along the lines of ""it was crazy because (nephew) peed at the playground and my parents didn't tell anyone."" To which I responded with ""did it cleaned"", was it messy, etc. Then I got upset when he said he didn't say anything either because he wanted to respect his parent's decision. He said he would have said something if it was our kids that peed. 

-We do love each other. 

-Larry has said multiple times he would cut ties with his parents if I asked him to but I maintain that family is important. So I don't think I'm looking for something to be angry about every time they are together. 

-I recognize that despite our core values on societal wellbeing vs personal choice is very very different I still had no right to call him names and have apologized. We are going to try counseling. "
amitheasshole,AITA for asking my dad for money?,3,2025-03-30 22:58:28,7,"I know the title sounds okay ish but the intentions behind it aren't so great.

When I was about 8 years old me and my biological dad had moved in with my aunt and cousin's farm because he got kicked out of my grandmas house (she lives about 50 yards from my aunts home) and money was tight because my dad was bouncing jobs because he demands his ""respect"". So on a certain week my aunt calls me and my cousin out and says that ""if you can clean up all this horse poop I'll give you each $20."" So we did exactly that and got $20 the next day. Fast forward to the end of the week and my dad asks if he can use my $20 for gas and that he promises to pay me back

(My dad has a massive spending problem where he will buy sodas for himself and on the occasion, the mega monsters)

I say yeah In thoughts that im helping the family and give him the $20. I waited for a very long time and never got my money back.

Fast forward to present day and I came up with the idea of asking him for money slowly to have him pay me back (in small amounts of course). So every other day I asked him for $2 because I was ""thirsty"" at school. He had payed back $16 of the money and I called it quits because it felt like what I was doing was wrong. I mean it felt wrong to have a grudge for 7 years about $20 but at the same time it makes me upset that the person who promises to keep promises breaks his one promise. 

AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for yelling at my mom after she complained about me not going to church?,5,2025-03-30 21:35:10,18,"In this one I think I'm an asshole. My mother is religious, she goes to church every Sunday and invites me to go with her once a month. Today I didn't really feel like going, but she invited me to go. I told her I don't want to go, I preferred to stay at home after so many projects at college. She told me that, for paying for my studies and always going to my events, I have the responsibility to go with her to church, because since she has accompanied me to events I also have to do that.

That seemed illogical to me, she kept insisting and the truth is that I was irritable at that time, it's Sunday, she woke me up very early and I fell asleep at 3AM for being very tolerant with my team and allowing them to send me their parts of the project so late, however, I didn't yell at 100 decibels, but I raised my voice and told her I didn't want to go to a place where they would only steal money from her. We fought for another while, in the end I ended up not going to church and not going back to sleep for having done that, I know I was disrespectful, and it made me think that probably if my mom didn't go to an event of mine just because she didn't feel like it I would also get angry.

She hasn't arrived yet, she usually stays at my brother's house for a while and then comes back, I'm going to apologize when she does, but I don't know what to tell her.

I don't think I'm an asshole for not wanting to go to church as such, I think I'm an asshole because just like my mom has accompanied me to events that I consider important I also had to do it.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my father off?,19,2025-03-30 13:48:23,48,"I (23 F) just had a big argument with my dad and he is not willing to listen to me, like always.

Today, I was going on about my day as usual when I suddenly felt so emotional and that I'd start crying any moment, no angry fits just sad and depressed. I shrugged it off as my period is nearing and this must be my hormones acting up.

My father (52? M) planned to take me, my sister and my mother out so we can buy new mattress for MY BED to replace the broken old one (I have been sleeping on the floor for months and it's not bad. I even got a topper to lay down on and it's comfy enough so i never felt the need to buy a new one in a hurry). He never informed me of that before so it took me by a surprise. 

At that point I feel too emotional to go outside as I'd probably cry. He doesnt care despite me protesting and dragged me out anyway and keep saying that I am weak for not being able to stop crying. Needless to say, I cried the whole trip at furniture store with no real reason. The thing is I can't stop. I instantly know it's because my hormones. I would never cry in front of strangers. 

He keep saying that I am childish, I never answered back. After we got home, I excused myself to my room so I could sort myself out in peace.

Then he followed me into my room and keep berating me about how I am a disappointment, unable to take care of myself and childish that I cant stop crying. I told him that my period is near and I am unable to control my tears because my hormones are weird right now. He doesnt care though. He keep saying that I use it as an excuse all the time.Which is not true. This is my first time being unable to control my tears like that. I rarely cry in front of him let alone in public. 

So I decided to end the argument by telling him to leave me alone if he is not willing to listen to my point of view. I never talked back to him so this is probably new. Now we are not talking to each other at all. 

AITA for just dismissing him like that?

amitheasshole,AITA for calling my teacher irresponsible?,6,2025-03-30 20:41:21,16,"So basically, when I was in grade 8, my math teacher was horrible. She would always call us ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù, whenever a few of us got a bad grade on a test, or she would talk bad about our class to other teachers. But basically one night I forgot to do a quiz we had to do for homework, and our grade had this 3 day policy where we only have 3 days to hand in a missing assignment to get a 75, but if we don‚Äôt hand it in within those 3 days the grade stays a 0, and we also had to send the teacher an email saying we did it so they can change the grade if we did the assignment within 3 days. 

But as I was saying, I had this quiz I forgot to do for homework, so I did it the next day, handed it in, and sent my teacher an email saying I did it. Fast forward 2 weeks later, she never changed the grade for that assignment I finished. So before lunch I went to her and asked her if she could change my grade since I did it the next day, and she said yes. But what did she do? Still not grade it. 

I was eventually fed up with this, so the next day I told her in the morning when I had her class, and she literally told me, ‚Äúwell, thats not my fault you handed it in 2 weeks late, so it‚Äôs staying a 0.‚Äù i literally handed in within 3 days, and now she‚Äôs saying its late? I clearly sent her an email about it saying I finished it, so I told her to check her email, and when she did, she said, ‚Äúwell, It‚Äôs not my responsibility to be checking emails every night.‚Äù like what the hell? It technically is because you‚Äôre a teacher. So I told her, ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs not my fault you‚Äôre irresponsible that you can‚Äôt even check a simple email to change a students grade when it was clearly handed in within 3 days.‚Äù So she sent me to the principal‚Äôs office when I said that, and I got lunch detention for 3 days. so lmk, AITA for saying shes irresponsible?"
amitheasshole,AITA for insisting my BF get rid of clothes that don't fit,42,2025-03-30 08:29:59,39,"My boyfriend's mother is a sweet person.  She loves to buy clothes on sale or get good bargains, to give to friends and relatives. The clothes are not goodwill stuff, clothes are nice, new with tags and brand names.  She gives us large boxes of clothes for everyone, i.e. me, BF & kids. 
Some clothes don't fit me or not my style.  Also, my BF doesn't forward kid's clothes to the kids timely.  I have had the kid's boxes in storage since 2018.  Of course, the kids grow and clothes from 2018 do not fit anymore. 
So BF will not do anything with the kid's boxes. When we discuss it, BF gets upset because I want get rid of these clothes. BF wants to mail these boxes to other family members in other states. Which is ok with me, but it's so expensive I won't pay shipping. Shipping about $75 per box. Probably have 20 boxes at this point.
So am I an asshole because I want these clothes gone? "
amitheasshole,WIBTA if I turned off the WiFi until I can't smell or hear mice anymore?,764,2025-03-29 16:52:41,435,"For context, my spouse and I are both neurodiverse, and live with chronic pain. Keeping the house clean has always been a struggle, and it's a sore spot in our relationship. We also have different standards for what is a liveable amount of clutter/mess. I can handle clutter to a point, but I cannot tolerate mess that creates health hazards or attracts pests.

We both work full time, but most of the household responsibilities fall to me. Keeping house sucks for everyone, but it especially sucks when you're disabled. But I'm forced to push through my limitations while my spouse refuses. As an example, I have severe low back issues that make washing dishes painful at best, but often excruciating. My spouse has sensory issues and doesn't like touching dirty dishes (nevermind that if they just went in the dishwasher right away, they wouldn't have time to get gross). So her 'yuck' outweighs my pain. I think she has washed the dishes <10 times since we've been married.

Because of new construction nearby, our entire neighborhood has had mouse problems this year. But, everyone else has been able to get rid of them. Not us. If you've ever dealt with mice, you know that the only way to get rid of them is to take away any food sources that aren't in a trap. As long as you continue to leave your taco bell trash with a half-eaten burrito next to the couch where you finished it, the mice aren't going away. It is to the point where I am immediately greeted by mouse smell when I come home from work or open the bedroom door in the morning. And hearing them in the basement or behind the stove makes my skin crawl.

The only way I have found in the past to get my spouse to pitch in with cleaning is to kill the WiFi and refuse to turn it back on for the day--which is also how I motivate the kids to do their chores/homework
 I'm at a point where I'm ready to turn it off until I can't see, smell, or hear mice anymore even if it takes weeks. Would that make me the asshole to treat my spouse like I treat the children, and take away her Wi-Fi?

TLDR; Mice are taking over the house because my wife won't clean up after herself. WIBTA if I took away her Wi-Fi until she helps get rid of the infestation?

ETA: We have had a professional exterminator out. They have sealed entry points and set traps. But they told us that until we eliminate other food sources, the mice won't be forced to get food from the traps. In other words, there's nothing more they can do until we get the cleanliness issues under control.

Unfortunately, we have a lot of medical bills, and can't afford house cleaners. Even if we could, they can't be here every day. I wish this were an option, but it just isn't right now. And I barely have the energy to make it through the workday and try to maintain the home as is. I don't have anything left to put into overtime so we can afford a cleaner.

Assume that, in the short term at least, divorce is not a realistic option. Though I think we're definitely headed that way.

He was very popular and wellknown in our company. I have worked with him in a close team setup for several years and was really sad when I learned that he passed away. Next week is his funeral. I and some other coworkers who worked with him wanted to attend. Now the issue: We have one coworker who has sever FOMO and is kind of a brown noser to the higher ups. He only knows the deceased from the stories we tell about him and he met him only once at a company function where they talked for about 5 minutes in a group setup. He is now running around the company and tells everybody how tragic the death is and how affected he is. Also when I told my boss that I need PTO to attend the funeral I was told that it would not be possible as at least one team member has to be present in the company and said coworker already asked for PTO so he could attend the funeral. When I asked him if we could switch he told me: no be aide he wants to join the funeral as it would be good tone to join and management will sure appreciate it. That‚Äôs where I lost it and I told him to stop brown nosing and making the death of a coworker he didn‚Äôt know about him.

He since then complained to our boss that I was rude to him but most of our coworker are on my side.  So AITA?

Edit: I just had a meeting with our local and regional managers. They understand my point of view but asked me to use some maybe more diplomatic tone to voice it. They will shut down the local office for a few hours on the day of the funeral so everybody who wants can attend. The regional manager who also knew the deceased hinted that he also doesn‚Äôt like the grief tourism (I really liked this name) of this specific guy. He just isn‚Äôt allowed to voice it directly for HR reasons "

I am not dangerous and I am not stupid I just want to see them and say hello I do not try to hold them and I never interact with a child without a parent present (unless they are on there own and hurt to see if I can help)

Anyway yesterday I saw two beautiful ladies with a pram and I asked if I can look at the baby, they said yes and I commented how wonderful he was and asked how old he was (only a couple of months old). 

I also told them I liked there outfit and I said 'I don't mean to be rude but I noticed an accents and was wondering what your background was"" I like learning and hearing about new places anyway they said they were from Nigeria and I told them how a previous friend had been from Nigeria and commented a few things that I knew and mentioned how amazing the food is. 

They were smiling and happy (I hope) and we had a conversation about Nigerian food and they did say Nigerians take food very seriously and are very proud of it and I said how I would love to be able to cook more food like that as my aunt is teaching me some Zimbabwean dishes. 

I find people intresting and love getting to know them but my friend has said that even though they were black with an obvious accent and cultural clothes on me asking them there background was the same as being racist and asking where they are from (and insisting where are they really from, even though I would never asked that)
I belive I was interested and inquisitive and wanted to connect and I hope really hope I wasn't racist. 

Thanks (back ground is we are both white but I have an aunt who is from Zimbabwe and my friend is able bodied while I have a brain injury which causes cataplexy and narcolepsy as well as, mental health issues . I would have also asked background if there was an accent and they were white) "
amitheasshole,AITA for taking a nap when dad was hurt,0,2025-03-31 04:18:31,15,"This happened a while ago but I still think about it.

So about a month ago my dad suddenly texted me that i needed to take the train to visit him and help him because his leg was hurt and he couldn't walk. I did that and when I got there forced him to go to the hospital and there we found out his leg was actually broken and needed to be operated on.

While waiting for a time to operate he got a cast and medicine and stuff and was sent home. He obviously couldn't walk so he crawled around.

The day after coming home from the hospital I was still tired and dad was tired so he went to sleep. I was also tired so I decided to take a nap too.

Here's where some relevant info are needed I am deaf and can't hear if someone is yelling for help or anything. My room is also on the second floor of dad's house. I'm a heavy sleeper also but does have a special alarm clock that's made for deaf people that vibrates and light up to wake me up.

This is where I think I'm the asshole I went to sleep and about a hour later my alarm clock went off that someone was at the door. I was confused because dad couldn't walk and my alarm wasn't set to ring yet. So I went up and found dad had crawled to the door and was waiting at the end of the stairs, he was mad at me that I was asleep and didn't help him. I honestly thought he was going to sleep a lot longer and also I was tired.

amitheasshole,AITA 24F for asking my 28M bf to drive his second car while mine is broke down,0,2025-03-31 15:22:39,40,"AITA 24F for wanting to drive my 28M bf‚Äôs second car while mine is broke down?

A few months ago I gave my 28M bf 1k to buy his dream car (2012 335i BMW coupe) and we are both insured on the same policy and I pay his insurance on his car monthly. This is his second car. He daily drives a 2002 trailblazer that doesn‚Äôt go above 40mph as the tranny broke and is a garbage pit because he doesn‚Äôt take care of it and is better on gas than his BMW as the BMW takes premium gas only and we can‚Äôt afford the gas bill that would create as this car is already expensive and it‚Äôs the compromise we came up with. We live together and have for about 6 months and share finances. My 2020 Malibu (24F) just broke down. We‚Äôve been having this argument because he‚Äôs throwing a fit because I should have to drive his blazer and it‚Äôs unfair that I get to drive his dream car while we‚Äôre trying to get mine fixed (Will be a month or so). 

Here‚Äôs my POV: He‚Äôs being selfish as shoe on the other foot I‚Äôd without a heartbeat let him use my car whenever needed. He also keeps bringing up the fact that it‚Äôs his car and not mine (even though I helped pay for it, helped him get his credit score up to get a loan, and pay the insurance on it monthly). I‚Äôm the breadwinner in this relationship. In my past relationships and how I see other relationships around me, the man makes more of a sacrifice to make sure the woman is safe etc. (Sexist I know. Is this even a valid point anymore or is this just traditionalist thinking?). I have offered that we would both need to make sacrifices (keyword both) and I would only drive the car for necessary things etc but it‚Äôs still not good enough. 

Looking for other POV‚Äôs here. What would you do in this situation? AITA?"
amitheasshole,AITA for wanting a car that I like over what my husband thinks I should be happy with?,0,2025-03-31 07:48:35,2,"AITA? I need a car. My husband and I (30s) have a few kids and for the majority of our marriage I haven't had a reliable vehicle. Essentially when one breaks down he would take the working one with a promise to fix the other when we can. This usually didn't happen. I'd drive the unreliable vehicle near where we lived only when necessary. The last time he bought me a vehicle he specifically told me this was for me and our family and wanted to take a picture of me next to it to post online. I was excited of course and this was a few years ago. The next day he wanted to take the new car to work which I understood and had no issue with. This kept happening where I would have to have something very specific to do that day for him to maybe leave me my car. Whenever I would tell him I don't like this he'd say that I never go anywhere anyways so why does it matter. This was during the dark times so many fun things weren't open still. As time went on he started tricking out this new vehicle. When he didn't care that he did something to it I found inconvenient was the moment it really hit me that this isn't my car. So about a year ago his car had issues that would be too much to fix so essentially we've been sharing ""my"" car since that point. He promised to buy me a vehicle with a hint that it can't be too cool because he'll probably take it again. I'm at a point where that's not happening because I absolutely need to be able to get around with the kids. We looked at cars within our budget and I didn't like the one he was pushing me to get. I preferred the one that wasn't a base model. I understand that it was $5k more than he wanted to spend so I took it upon myself to try to find something that I like within that price point with low mileage. We got into an argument because he says I'm spoiled and prioritizing the bells and whistles over reliability when I do want something reliable but I also want to like what I'm going to be driving for the next 5+ years. Mind you he's driving a nice suv originally meant for me and intends to buy himself a sports car next year. He makes really good money but we just don't budget so it's always ""tight."" I'm a stay at home mom and I feel like he doesn't value my contributions. He says he deserves to drive a nice vehicle and I do feel that he should. I appreciate all that he does for us. But AITAH for wanting to at least like what I'm driving? For context he makes 6 figures and the vehicle I liked is ~$25k. This actually turned into an argument and I want to know if I'm really being unreasonable for wanting something I like. It's not even what I really want but I get that where we're at that would not be a good idea. He called me spoiled and said it's because of how I grew up which hurt. I just feel like after waiting all these years I want something that I actually like. Please tell me if I'm TAH. We can't even find a compromise because he says everything I like at his price is either ugly to him or the miles are too high. I want to add the vehicle that I actually want is exactly what my husband originally bought ""for me"" but it's too expensive so I'm trying to find a compromise. 

TLDR; I want to get a reasonable car that I'm going to be happy in and my husband thinks I'm spoiled. We can't agree on a car at the price he wants and he's been driving what he bought me before. He's buying himself a sports car next."
amitheasshole,AITA for setting boundaries with my mother?,1,2025-03-31 03:52:18,3,"My wife (30F) and I (30M) moved back to Florida last May after I left the service. My mother and brother (37M) live nearby, about 10 minutes apart, while we‚Äôre an hour away. Her family is 30‚Äì40 minutes away.

We visit my mother and her family about once a month, but I only see my brother occasionally for birthdays and holidays due to a strained relationship. For my mom‚Äôs birthday, we went all out with a new TV and dinner. Around Christmas, she organized a gathering with a $50 gift cap for couples. We followed the rule, assuming time together mattered most, but others ignored the limit. Everyone seemed fine, and laughed it off so we continued to enjoy each others company. Before leaving, we told my mom we‚Äôd take a break from family gatherings, my family and hers, until February or March. She understood, and we left feeling good.

In January, my brother called to berate me for not visiting our mom enough, accused us of treating them like outcasts, and was offended by our gifts including Mexican skulls because he hates Mexicans‚Äî, my wife is Mexican. He demanded we see them twice a month and spend all major holidays with them. I told him off and cut him out of my life completely now.

I called my mom, who was disappointed in my brother but also confirmed that she was upset about Christmas, saying she felt unappreciated and unwelcome in her own house, even considering moving away. She hung up crying. My wife revealed she‚Äôd been dealing with similar guilt-tripping from my mom throughout our marriage.

A couple of days later, my wife and I discussed a compromise. When I reached out, my mom blew me off. So i didnt talk to her ultimately accepting she doesn't want to talk. A month later, she finally texted, and we talked, addressing our feelings. She assured me she never meant to push me away, and I explained Christmas wasn‚Äôt meant as an insult and how whatever thing we supposedly did never happened hence why we thought it was a good time. We agreed to move forward slowly.

Over the next few months, we texted occasionally. In March, she suggested meeting in April, but I had to work out of state. She responded that she was hurt I hadn‚Äôt tried to see her sooner since once again i live an hour away and she was just being honest. I feel drained and like a broken record, but also feel like ah for wanting to maintain boundaries instead of excusing her behavior.

amitheasshole,AITA the asshole for applying to my mom‚Äôs job after she kept avoiding questions of employment.,4,2025-03-30 21:44:18,9,"Hi, I am 28/F am I the asshole for calling my mom‚Äôs job to see if they were hiring. I had a full-time job and my mother convinced me to go into refineries. She said I was too comfortable at my job and need a higher paying job. I went to a hiring agency in refineries, but didn‚Äôt know they aren‚Äôt really having too much good turnarounds so I left my job for what I thought was a guaranteed career since they told me over a month ago they had a position for me but  they‚Äôve been delaying training. I did not know much about refineries. I just took her advice to get a TWIC card and now here we are.

I have been jobless for almost over a month and I‚Äôve been very stressed because I have bills to pay and I really can‚Äôt afford to do anything.  my mother seems to not want to deal with me being emotional. But I find it funny that she was able to hire my sisters, but not me . My older sister is a certified RN, but at  the same time, I do have the same medical credentials as my other sister and she still won‚Äôt hire me .growing up, she has been a very mentally abusive and really emotionally absent  as a mother, and when I tend to cry, she seems to get angry at that. I asked her weeks ago if her job was hiring, and she told me to not disturb her while she‚Äôs with company. I went out of  my way to call her job to see if they were hiring and put my application in. 
Once she found out I called her job and applied she been claiming I was jeopardizing her career and being evil. She called me sisters and everyone said I was wrong and none will talk to me and it‚Äôs been days. So I am jobless taking her advice and clearly a villain trying to show her I have work ethics. AITA

amitheasshole,AITA for not inviting a long time friend on a trip,3,2025-03-30 20:00:27,6,"I met this friend in college and became close friends in a group of 5 of us. That was in 2017. We‚Äôve all stayed close throughout those years, but all agree that she has a hard time respecting boundaries.

She‚Äôs constantly late. I recently got lunch with her and planned for noon. She pushed the time back to 12:15. Told me at 12:30 she‚Äôs was hopping in the shower. Showed up at 12:45. This isn‚Äôt a one time occurrence. It‚Äôs a constant where at this point she‚Äôs not respecting my time.

Another example. We as a group go to an island on vacation. We rent a car (imagine a Toyota Corolla). I‚Äôm driving and google maps takes us on a dirt road. The further along we get the more packed with vegetation it gets. We start scratching the bottom of the car on rocks and at this point I‚Äôm thinking we need to turn around. We go a bit further and at this point it‚Äôs constant and in front of us I see the road start to go up a hill of rocks. Mind you it‚Äôs just rained. I get out of the car because I‚Äôm panicking. This is a rental! I‚Äôm stressed and she keeps trying to push me to go forward even though I‚Äôm visibly upset and nervous. There‚Äôs nothing around us but trees so I don‚Äôt want to get stuck. 10 minutes of me begging to turn around, no joke, a man comes out of the jungle yelling ‚ÄúGO BACK‚Äù. She goes up to him to talk and is like you sure we can‚Äôt keep going and he says no go back. She finally listens and we turn around. Later that night I tell her I think you don‚Äôt take someone‚Äôs No as No but as a reason to convince them of what you want. She verbatim said ‚Äúwhy is your no more important than my yes‚Äù.

One of our biggest issues with her is when she wants to do something she will badger you about it to break you down until you agree. It‚Äôs so stressful and I‚Äôve come to the realization that it‚Äôs a lack of respect for boundaries and it was made even more apparent after her comment. Isnt a no ALWAYS more important than a yes?

She does things like this consistently on trips and I‚Äôm at a point where I just want to have stress free times with my friends. Her and I live 20 minutes away from each other but saw one another maybe 4 times last year. Is it crazy to not invite someone on a trip that you‚Äôve grown apart from?

I mentioned a trip to Vegas then she messaged me asking what my vibe will be, if we‚Äôll be drinking all day, if we‚Äôre gonna be partying so she can prepare. I kept telling her I don‚Äôt know what my day will look like a month from now, and I had to keep repeating myself. She said she just wants to know so if we‚Äôll be drinking she won‚Äôt drink for three weeks in advance. That concerned me so on top of the fact I already know she‚Äôll stress all of us out by doing what I explained above I also have to worry about making sure my vibe is the same as I said because I don‚Äôt want to mislead her even though things change all the time.

None of us want her to go but feel bad leaving her out."

I called my boyfriend and said how amazing it is that we have free will and how there are so many opportunities we have in life. He responded to that by talking about all of life‚Äôs limitations and how awful the government is, then started to complain about his financial problems. About ten minutes later when I was starting my schoolwork, I realized that I got in a bad mood and asked him to cheer me up. He asked if he was the reason why I got into such a sudden bad moon. When I said yes and explained why, he got upset and said that he feels like he is walking on eggshells. He said ‚ÄúI am sorry that my joke about the government wasn‚Äôt funny‚Äù. After that I told him that I was hanging up.

Am I being too sensitive


UPDATE: ‚ÄúI am sorry for overreacting over my mood being killed. ultimately I am responsible for my mood and being upset that you don‚Äôt share the same point of view is needy of me‚Äù

amitheasshole,AITA for enforcing a chore chart,3,2025-03-30 23:31:54,7,"I (19F) and my roommate (19F) have been living together since October 2024 and have never discussed household responsibilities and just silently agreed to cleanup after each other and ourselves.

Ever since she hosted a NYE party theres been a shift in effort and I feel like im becoming a maid; It took me until early February to have the place back to normal (popping balloons, re-arranging furniture, vacuuming glitter *everywhere*). I clean up after every function she hosts and take out the trash almost every two days because she eats out more and drinks a surplus of canned soda (almost a 24pk every other week). Instead of taking care of the garbage she just piles stuff on top and around it. I have been the only one doing the dishes for a few weeks and I dont even think she's even glanced at the toilet bowl once. Her boyfriend (18M) being a very frequent guest does not help, literally and figuratively, despite contributing to the problem just as much as she does; he is not on the lease but has a key. 

on 3/28 I noticed the trash was full and decided to wait and see if she'd take care of it for once. I could literally smell it before walking in the unit after work this morning and there's more trash than ever. She usually rushes to clean before a function but just decided not to yesterday for some reason.

I've been working 10-12 hour shifts, seven days a week since February and have had my days of not cleaning but fix my behavior before the week is over because its a shared space and I don't believe that energy is being reciprocated so I proposed a chore chart; This was after I decided to view other forums and a lot of people were saying doing this is controlling, is that true?

Then, I texted when I left 2 hours later and when I made it back to my apartment. I sent a Snapchat from inside the club halfway in. She needs space now and doesn‚Äôt want a conversation. I think I could‚Äôve done better at saying an ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù or something but idek what kind of update I‚Äôm supposed to send. I also feel like needing space for a day is little overboard. She also does this very often when she goes out. I tell her to lmk when she leaves or where she‚Äôs going and doesn‚Äôt a good amount of times now.

amitheasshole,AITA for telling my friends that they should break up?,2,2025-03-30 23:17:32,19,"I (M23) met Adam (M23) and Bibi (F22) in my first year of college. Adam and I became friends quickly since we had a lot of common hobbies and a similar attitude toward many things.

After about a semester, Adam started dating Bibi. At first, they had a great relationship and seemed really happy together. Over time, there were some arguments between us, but I always thought it was normal for friends to have occasional disagreements.

The worst fight we had was at the start of summer break. I made a joke referring to B‚Äôs cousin as a ""hobo,"" which is just part of how I normally talk when joking around with Adam. Bibi overheard the conversation and got really upset. As a result, Adam stopped talking to me because Bibi demanded an apology, and I refused to apologize for how I speak. After summer break, things went back to normal fairly quickly (within two weeks at most).

This past year, before Christmas, I started noticing problems in their relationship. They began fighting more frequently and would go days without speaking to each other. Since then, they‚Äôve broken up multiple times.

During their latest breakup, I told Adam that I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea for him to get back with B if they couldn't even stay happy for two weeks straight. Apparently, during one of their fights, A mentioned to Bibi that I had said this. Now, Bibi has once again forbidden Adam from talking to me if he wants to continue any sort of relationship with her.

So, AITA for telling my friend he should move on instead of getting back together with his girlfriend?

Edit:changed the names for clarification 
Edit 2: From the Hobo thing to the breakups it's been 2 years and Im not sure she was still mad for that because the first time they broke up she came to talk with me for support."
amitheasshole,WIBTA If i message my boyfriend's friend's girlfriend for underpaying him for his help,0,2025-03-31 14:08:09,66,"On Saturday, my (25f) boyfriend (25m) did all 4 brakes for his friend's (25m) girlfriend (26f). They bought the parts, my boyfriend just did the labor to replace them. Total it took 4 hours to do. He isn't a professional mechanic but he has worked on cars his whole life. In the process he did strain his back (hes 6ft 5 and it was a sedan), it was killing him all day Sunday.

Afterwards, the friend bought my boyfriend chipotle. His girlfriend later sent my boyfriend $75 for his time. That night, we all went to their place to have a few drinks, the friend asked my boyfriend to pick up a pack of white claw for him, which is about $18-$20. The friend didnt pay my boyfriend back for it.

So in the end, my boyfriend got paid about $70 ($75+ $15-$20) total for 4 hours of labor to replace the brakes, which at a mechanic would usually cost $800-$1200.

Cost wasnt discussed ahead of time, the friend just said he would pay him. My boyfriend does feel like it was a kick to the balls, but hes too nice to say anything. He just says he won't help them with her car next time they ask.

I do agree he was underpaid. My boyfriends mom says it would be more polite if i contacted the girlfriend since its woman to woman, but she is very old fashioned. I know my boyfriend won't speak up. I have known the couple for 2 years now, i'd say I am friends with the friend and acquaintances with the girlfriend. The girlfriend and I have nice conversations when we see each other but we don't hang out together as friends or feel close. 

WIBTA if i messaged the girlfriend saying my boyfriend is too nice to say so but he felt underpaid for his service? I could be the asshole if I reached out to the girlfriend because it's technically my boyfriend's business, and the pay wasn't specifically established beforehand. I don't want to come off as overly confrontational, just to advocate for my boyfriend."
amitheasshole,AITA for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday not going well because i misjudged his behavior?,3,2025-03-30 22:49:27,9,"So, this happened on Friday‚Äîmy boyfriend's (22m) birthday was really strange. When I arrived at his house to spend time with him and his family, it was super quiet. Everyone was in their own corners, and he seemed kind of down. But as soon as I sat on his bed, he started talking about how hot it was in the house and how the open windows were making his allergies act up. and we started talking about my school and stuff, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first.
Then, during dinner, things got even weirder. It was still quiet, and everyone was making small talk just to fill the silence. I felt like I walked into some strange tension. Nobody was being mean, but my boyfriend's quietness didn‚Äôt help. Generally, everyone is soft-spoken and a bit sarcastic, but this time felt off. My boyfriend and his brothers were really quiet, just talking among themselves, and I felt like I was just an observer, which made things awkward.
After we finished eating, his mom and I took a break to prepare the cheesecake we had made the day before. We planned it together since he mentioned wanting one and decided to make the topping fresh. I started to question his behavior when he and his brother left for Hobby Lobby without a word while we were preparing the frosting. I was annoyed because it was his first time leaving me alone with his mom and her boyfriend. When they returned, they were playing with stretchy gorillas.
So, that was when I felt even more out of place and started to get frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt read the room anymore. Nobody seemed interested in the desserts, and when my boyfriend mentioned eating them, his mom said we were just waiting for them. The boys were just sitting on their phones, not talking to us, while his mom and her boyfriend made little comments about their behavior. I felt like I was stuck in the middle, and it was really overwhelming. 
When he finally opened his gift, everyone questioned if he should do it now. I said it was up to him. He thanked me and put it away. Later, when his mom offered us time alone, we built Legos together. I apologized that I felt anxious about giving him the gift; and but soon he started giving me attitude, when i called him out he claimed I deserved it because his mom and I were stressing him out on his birthday.
My anxiety got the better of me, so I told him I was frustrated because it felt like he left me in the dark. He claimed I sided with his mom and suggested I should have just asked him where he was going. Since she was gone all day, he didn‚Äôt think his brothers leaving was significant. I apologized and asked if he could understand my perspective, but he said he didn‚Äôt want to discuss it anymore because it was his birthday. I ended up feeling so overwhelmed that I cried for a long time, apologizing because I felt horrible about the tension on his birthday. All I wanted was for him to feel loved and celebrated, and it felt like I let him down. AITA?

amitheasshole,AITA for correcting my mom or not knowing stuff?,3,2025-03-31 02:33:54,12,"Idk wtf her problem with me is. Earlier today at like 2pm (when I take my dog out) I walk upstairs and head to the garage to the room where my dog stays during the day, I open the door to see my pizza box of pizza fries that I had planned to eat tonight. I began to ask my mom why the box was out there but she cut me off yelling at me saying ‚ÄúWHY DO YOU ALWAYS WAKE ME UP WHEN IM SLEEPING‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know she was sleeping. There‚Äôs more stairs to go up to her living room where she was and a wall blocking my view. She just yelled at me for no reason, says I every time she‚Äôs sleeping I wake her up. I cried for a good half an hour from that thinking she hates me. Then later tonight, a couple mins ago we were talking about a plane crash and she had the location wrong so I simply tried to help her out saying the right one. She was insistent that the one she said was right so I look it up to make sure and I tell her again what the right one was and then she yells at me again saying ‚ÄúYOU DONT HAVE TO DO THAT. YOU DONT HAVE TO ALWAYS CORRECT ME LIKE IM A 2 YEAR OLD, YOURE NOT MY MOTHER IM NOT A CHILD. I DONT LIKE BEING CORRECTED YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO PROVE ME WRONG‚Äù I truly believe she hates me. All she‚Äôs been doing lately is yelling at me. I‚Äôm crying rn as I‚Äôm tryna go to sleep now and she doesn‚Äôt care. She‚Äôs just talking about random crap like I don‚Äôt exist. Idk if I can talk about this to my older brother because I feel like he‚Äôd tell her and she‚Äôd hate me more. My other 2 older siblings left the family and haven‚Äôt looked back since and I am beginning to understand why. She also yelled at me earlier this morning for not taking dishes out of the dishwasher when I didn‚Äôt know if they were clean or dirty. When I heard her wake up I went to ask but she didn‚Äôt even let me speak she just yelled at me. Her bf who also lives here hates me too and idk why. He tries to make her hate me more by making up random lies. I don‚Äôt know what I did to him to make him hate me and want to make my mom hate me? I‚Äôm an overly sensitive person and she knows this. When I was younger she would check up on me after she yelled at me and she‚Äôd say sorry. She hasn‚Äôt done that in many many years. "
amitheasshole,AITA for texting my friend my issues with him out of nowhere?,1,2025-03-31 01:41:37,7,"So regardless of what the actual issue is, would you say that it‚Äôs not cool to text a friend to communicate issues you have them out of nowhere?


So for context, basically I don‚Äôt appreciate my friend always pushing me to do shit after I already have told him no. Like I‚Äôm trying set a boundary and he always has to question why. And there‚Äôs a lot of other things beyond that which make me honestly resent him.


I think that rather than hold resentment I would rather tell him my issues. So I text him after thinking about what exactly I have a problem with and explain my point of view. 


After doing this, he understands where I‚Äôm coming from but thinks I‚Äôm an ass for springing this on him randomly rather than in the moment. Like he said he‚Äôll work on what I addressed but says it‚Äôs unfair and not cool to just drop this whole argument on him through text. 


I can see where he‚Äôs coming from but when I‚Äôm hanging out with people I don‚Äôt come there premeditated assuming I‚Äôm gonna argue with them so when they do something that bothers me in, in the moment I‚Äôm just taken aback and am not really in a place to properly articulate what I‚Äôm feeling. That only comes after I process what happened. So I simply end up telling him after I processed everything. And it‚Äôs easier for me to text it cause I don‚Äôt wanna get heated and end up saying shit that‚Äôs unnecessarily mean. 


I think I‚Äôm handling it the best I can because there‚Äôs never gonna be a good opportunity to address something to someone. While he thinks of it like dropping a lot drama on his lap and making him deal with it. Or even that I‚Äôm escalating something small by treating it seriously rather than just letting it go. So AITA for bringing up conflict randomly? 


Edit: thanks for the comments and understanding as well as the legitimate and fair criticism. I see where I went wrong. I see now it‚Äôs not bad to take a step back to gather my thoughts but it‚Äôs wrong and unfair to confront someone through text, I‚Äôll apologize and approach conflict better in the future. "

We‚Äôve been through a lot, but lately, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs time to cut her off. We were hanging out at a coffee shop the other day, just like we always do, and when it came time to pay, she pulls the classic move ""Oops I forgot my wallet"" Now, I‚Äôve been falling for this trick for way too long. Every single time we hang out, it‚Äôs the same thing, she forgets her wallet, and I end up paying for her stuff. She knows I‚Äôll always do it because I feel guilty saying no. But this time? I had had enough.I flat-out told her I wasn‚Äôt paying for her this time. She starts with the usual, ""Do you not have enough? Are you seriously not going to pay?"" and I‚Äôm sitting there, boiling with frustration. Like, no. I wasn‚Äôt going to let her pull that crap again. I didn‚Äôt even try to stay calm. I just snapped. I started yelling at her, right there in the coffee shop. I didn‚Äôt care who was looking, I was just done. I told her exactly how I felt, that I was sick of being manipulated, that I wasn‚Äôt her personal ATM. Of course, she tried to turn it around on me, like I was the crazy one. ""You‚Äôre really gonna act like this in public?"" she said. But honestly, I didn‚Äôt care. I was finally standing up for myself. The thing is, I¬†*really*¬†want to cut ties with her. She‚Äôs always pulling me back in with her apologies and excuses, making me forget all the crap she‚Äôs done. And I do forget, that is, but I pretend like I do because I still have feelings for her.

amitheasshole,AITA - Friend/landlord wants me to help pay for house repairS,2,2025-03-30 21:03:58,7,"About three years ago, I moved to a new town for a new job. For most of that time, I lived in a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment. However, I met a good friend who had recently bought a house. After a month or so, she mentioned that her mortgage and bills were higher than expected and that she might need a roommate to help with costs.

Living in Florida, where things can get expensive, my apartment rent was already high. So, we came up with the idea that I could move in with her to lower expenses for both of us. I currently occupy a small bedroom, a linen closet, and a bathroom. However, after moving in, she told me she wanted my bathroom to double as a guest bathroom‚Äîsomething I wasn‚Äôt aware of beforehand. Both of our bathrooms are on the same floor and equally accessible, but even her own mom preferred to use her bathroom instead of mine when she visited.

I asked if we could install a door in the small hallway leading to my room and bathroom to give me some additional privacy. She has the same setup on her side, but she does have a door. She said she didn‚Äôt want to spend the money and suggested a curtain instead. I‚Äôm willing to pay for the door myself so that I don‚Äôt have to get fully clothed every time I walk from my bathroom to my room. Also, the way the house is set up, you can hear everything from the living room when I‚Äôm using the bathroom, which is awkward.

However, that‚Äôs not the main issue. Recently, she‚Äôs had some unforeseen problems with the house, one of which was a fumigation issue. She asked me to cover a quarter of the cost, saying that since we share the space, it was fair. I politely declined, wanting to stick to our original verbal agreement, which included everything in my set rent amount.

Later, I spoke with her again and said that while I‚Äôd be willing to contribute‚Äîbut only because we‚Äôre friends‚ÄîI don‚Äôt feel obligated. I also took the opportunity to set some boundaries, explaining that as a renter, I don‚Äôt have to worry about out-of-pocket costs when things break, but the trade-off is that I‚Äôm not building equity in the house.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? More importantly, AITA?!"
amitheasshole,AITA for telling my sister's friends that I'm gay,128,2025-03-29 21:59:26,50,"Help, this is like my 3rd time tryna post this. A while back, my sister brought home 5 friends to hang out at our house. Anyways, my sister (14) is at that phase in her life where she doesn't want to have anything to do with me and my parents, and she just wants to be around her friends. Anyways, after around an hour of her friends coming over, I (16) started to talk to one of the girls, as it turned out we had loads of the same interests like music and stuff. So we started having a conversation, I saw that my sister was getting annoyed and she left with a few of the others into our room. 

So I'm here with this friend, let's call her Sandy, and another girl, we can call Luna. We started to bond over lots of stuff, talking and laughing, and just having normal conversations, but halfway through, Sandy said that she was bi, so I was like ""I'm gay as well!"" and then Luna said that she also liked girls. But after that Luna left to do smth and Sandy said that she said that bc she liked one of the other girls that my sister was hanging out with, so I gave her some advice on what to do. Then, after Sandy went to the bathroom, Luna came back and told me that she had a crush on Sandy, so I just gave her some advice as well. They both told me not to tell my sister, as my sister doesn't know and my sister isn't exactly accepting of queer people, including me, so i agreed. After that, I just made gay jokes as that's just what I do sometimes, but my sister came out at this time and heard only me making gay jokes, and she was not happy. A few weeks later, my sister invited Luna and 2 other friends, but for some reason, Luna wasn't talking to me, after she told me on Discord (I gave her my Discord last time) that my sister said to them not to interact with me for some reason.

Last week my sister suggested to my mum that she should go out with her friends somewhere around 30 minutes away by bus. My mom said sure if I came with them, but my sister was not having it. I was in another room, but I heard her tell my mum, ""Last time my friends were here, she just kept on telling them about how she was gay"". My family is very religious, so when I came out, it was mostly me getting shouted at, and then trying to shove it into a corner and forget about it. So when my sister went to shower, I tried to explain to her everything, and that for 14-year-olds, stuff like this feels like a lot, so I was just trying to help. My mum still insists that I should not have told them, and I don't know if I'm in the wrong.

Since then, Sandy and Luna have not talked on Discord, as we all think that it's too much of a hassle with my sister being her. Example, my sister would notice that I'm texting Luna so she on a call with her other friends start bad talking Luna and sandy, but she doesn't mean it as she trying to do it so that I will tell them and there will be like tension and shit, I don't even know what she's trying to achieve with that. So with that, am I the asshole?"

His idea is to have all adults in the living room, and his nieces (6, 8, 14 and 16 years old) in the ‚Äústudio‚Äù room where we have two gaming PCs (REALLY expensive ones, 3090 i9-12k 128 ram, & 2070 i7-8k 64 ram) + my work laptop + a ps5, Nintendo switch, and more consoles.

ALL of these things are mine, I met him way after buying everything, and I gave the 2070 PC to him so he could have his first one. I work with my laptop and 3090 (motion graphics mainly), and of course I love gaming and I‚Äôm trying to make him a gamer, so he doesn‚Äôt really understand much of this world.

I told him that I really don‚Äôt mind letting them play with anything, as long as I‚Äôm there to check on how they are using the controllers etc. He got kinda mad and told me that I‚Äôm being ‚Äújealous‚Äù and that I should be letting them play with my consoles and PCs, while we hang with his family at the living room. I told him several times that I think he is not understanding me, that all of that is super expensive and also fragile (mainly the Nintendo switch stuff), and that I do want to let them play if I can be with them. I also pointed out that I don‚Äôt think he would be chill if instead of my electronics they were playing with his instruments (drums, piano, etc), but he didnt really answered this.

Now he told me that he is not going to celebrate anything, he doesnt want to anymore.

AITA for not letting them play without my supervision? I know I tend to be super obsesive when it comes to my pc, consoles, phone etc, and that‚Äôs why everything is in super good condition. Should I just let them?

UPDATE: he came back and apologized. He said I was right and that he would feel the same if it were his instruments. He said he was reflecting basically how he feels regarding his own stuff, and that he wanted to be a good uncle, and he felt attacked like I didnt trust him. But he understands, and we are going to celebrate his birthday with the kids playing with toys and then have a play date with them separatedly! "
amitheasshole,AITA for stealing someone's girlfriend,0,2025-03-30 23:32:10,2,"Last year, I (18M) helped my girlfriend (17F) break up with her previous partner (23M).

Rewind to the events of last year

So i had been really close to this girl lately. She had been my friend crush for a while and we started hanging out almost every week ever since i started talking to her. We've really clicked together on pretty much any aspect, whether it be our sense of humor or our interest in pretty much any media.

What i haven't realized is that she's taken. In an online long-distance relationship that is. She never told me or her friends about it, and for those months i've looked for information regarding that. Afterall, i can't be this close with someone's girl.

In the end i confessed because it's been months since we've become really close. After i confessed, she also confessed to having a relationship.

But what she said is that she wants to be with me instead, and asked for my help to break up with her previous partner of 3 years.

For these past year, i've been loving her so much, trying my best to get her close to my family and vice versa. I really want to take this relationship seriously and help her with everything. She had also helped me a lot, and i felt really secure with her.

But the guilt still lingers. I guess it's from fear of social rejection because i took someone's girl? Just recently i started coming to terms with this fact.

She said she had helped me, and said i did the right thing. Because apparently they started dating when she's 13 and he's 19. The legal age in my country is 17. 

AITA?"

Not acceptable stayed up all night making noise and disturbing the roomates and kicked our cat ! Tried to take the car keys too! 
I HANDLED it badly though ; called her family very bad slurs and names you wouldn't talk to someone for ten years for. Now the fallout begins but my anger got the best of me

I don't think it's fair (or legal) for them to be driving like that ! "
amitheasshole,AITA for not going to my brother‚Äôs wedding?,244,2025-03-29 17:44:41,79,"I am not going to my brother‚Äôs wedding for a number of reasons. He and his gf are acting like I should drop everything to be there because family is so important to them. We are all in our late 20s- early 30s.

For context, my brother and I were close when we were younger and about 10 years ago he up and left the area where we all lived without warning, blocked the entire family, and didn‚Äôt speak to us for years. It‚Äôs worth noting that his reason was an issue between our dad and him and nothing to do with the rest of us. Even since he cut us all off, our dad has invited him and now his gf on family vacations (probably 20+ invites at this point), fully paid for, no strings attached, which my brother declines. The last few years he has spoken to me a few times, but the convo is short and shallow. He doesn‚Äôt answer simple questions like ‚Äúhow are you doing?‚Äù. Anyways, I feel like I don‚Äôt know him as a person anymore and decided that it‚Äôs not worth forcing a relationship.¬†

I have only met/seen his gf of 4 years twice. It seems that he portrays himself as a family guy, that he keeps up with me and the rest of the family (our sister, my mom, and our dad). He now lives near most of our extended family, so this guise of family guy is easy to maintain since he can show face and use it as proof to his extremely family oriented gf. (My sister and I don‚Äôt understand how the gf hasn‚Äôt caught on to any of this and has no idea that there‚Äôs problems?).

Anyways, without warning this past Christmas he got engaged to his gf in front of her family! The following week he informed us (me and my family that he cut off in the past) the wedding would be in 3 months. Wow! Because it happened so fast, I had to wonder, is this a shotgun wedding? Nope. Why is it so soon after their engagement? ‚ÄúBecause they have been dating for so many years and wanted a short engagement, oh and the venue is cheaper that weekend.‚Äù

This is too last minute for me in my pre-planned commitments. I just sold my house, got a promotion with more responsibilities, I am moving across the country and buying a new place (this has a lot of logistics). He is unaware of my life‚Äôs busyness bc he doesn‚Äôt talk to me!

In order to make this wedding, I would have to plan in the middle of my complicated move to fly and then drive (the closest airport is 2+ hrs away) to his rushed wedding that is conveniently down the street from where he and his gfs entire extended family live with the exception of me and my family (aka: our sister and parents) who all live a flight plus away. He is mad that I can‚Äôt be there and is telling everyone that family is so important to him that he would drop everything if it was reversed. If it was so important that I need to be there, he would‚Äôve consulted with me first, which he never did and what he conveniently leaves out when he tells the family that I am not going. My invite was probably a pity invite in the first place.

So, AITA for not going to my brother‚Äôs wedding?"
amitheasshole,AITA for calling my bf insecure and taking care of his friend?,233,2025-03-29 17:33:23,240,"My (17f) bf (18m) and our friend group (5 other ppl) all share a life 360.

Last night I saw one of them (17m) going like 110 down the highway, I checked his location history, and he had already gone from his work back home, so I assumed he left something there and was going back, but then it showed him going past the exit and he kept going.

I know some stuff with his girlfriend happened that day and she told him it may not work, and he was bummed about having to work during our friends swim senior night. I called him to make sure that everything was alright. He didn't pick up twice and picked up the third time and you could tell from his voice he was upset. His speed was consistent and it was maybe (11;30 -11:45ish). I asked him if he was alright and I told him I know it's been a bad day but please don't speed, slow down please. He started to slow down, and I told him he could talk to me. He said it was fine. I told him I knew it wasn't and that I didn't want him to feel sad or do something reckless he would regret, and that I was there for him. There was some back and forth that's muddled in my memory, but he accepted my help, and we met at 'a fast food place and talked. Now I'm not gonna put his buisness out here but he had a really long day

Like a bunch of stuff just happened to him that day, and it kept building up, and the gist is basically that he just had an awful day, and a build up of a lot of stuff from the past kinda crashed down on him. We ate, talked, I let him vent to me, I gave him a hug, tailed him till he got home, then went home and went to sleep. I woke up the next day to an ungodly amount of notifications from my friend and my bf. My friend just kept saying sorry, and other stuff, and my bf had a bunch of miscalls. I called my bf and he picked uo angry, and started yelling.

He asked why I would meet up with his friend late at night. I explained what was going on and he said he didn't care, and that if I really wanted to do something he would have called all of us or told someone else and not basically go on a date with him. I said it wasn't a date and that he was going trough something and I just wanted to help him. My bf said that he felt super disrespected that I would do that with his friend. I told him he was being super insecure and that I was just caring for his friend. He hung up and I told his friend it was ok but he was telling me that my bf was mad and he was sorry, and I told him it was ok but it's only been a few hours and I'm starting to think that I was in the wrong and I'm second guessing everything and I feel so bad."
amitheasshole,AITA for standing up for myself? or do I have a victim complex?,17,2025-03-30 07:30:26,11,"I noticed that a close friend had started making jokes at my expense, brushing them off as ‚Äúbanter.‚Äù Sometimes, they would outright insult me and laugh it off. I reached my breaking point when we were out with someone I didn‚Äôt know, and they casually exposed something deeply personal( my visits to a psychiatrist) as if it were a joke. In the moment, I was too shocked to react and just gave a nervous laugh, but as soon as I left, I felt awful. Later, I confronted them over text, telling them they had hurt me. Their only response was, ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù No apology, no acknowledgment. After that, they didn‚Äôt contact me for 10 days. Feeling hurt, angry, and emotional, I decided to block them from my social media I didn‚Äôt want someone who showed no remorse to have access to my life. On my private Twitter/X account (where I have only nine followers and treat it like a diary), I vaguely tweeted about my disappointment in some friendships. I didn‚Äôt mention any names or details.Then, I got a text from them(with screenshots of my tweets)along with a long, insulting message tearing apart my character. They accused me of having a victim complex, called me insecure and immature, and essentially attacked me for how I felt. When I told my other friends, they were shocked at how they had turned the tables on me when I was the one who was hurt. I was just reacting out of anger and sadness. So, did I overreact, or was I just standing up for myself? AITA?"

My ex started seeing this guy maybe a year ago, n they just recently met the kids. Apparently this guy makes remarks about me all the time. He has so far told my children that I kept their daddy from being his true self, and how my ex husband never loved me. My ex husband and I got into an argument over the phone while our children were at his house and his boyfriend was there, and he said infront of my children that I‚Äôm just a bitter baby mama; and said to them ‚Äúmama isn‚Äôt that friendly, is she?‚Äù He has made more comments then this and says only bad things about me to or infront of the children. I confronted them both of these things in which they said I was blowing stuff out of proportion and it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal, then I said fine I didn‚Äôt want my children already his boyfriend if he was gonna talk about me like that. This caused a big argument, and he ignored my wishes anyways.

Tonight I kept my children home when I asked if his boyfriend was there and he said yea, and that he is going to be apart of our children‚Äôs lives. I said well then I‚Äôm keeping the children tonight or any nights that he planned to his have his bf there and I even threatened to put a petition for it in court. He called me a homophobic ah and said I couldn‚Äôt control who he dates and that I was being a petty b*tch.

My mother has a job on Sundays, and my father goes and helps her, so that leaves me and my sister home alone. We have 4 dogs that we have to watch when our parents leave. I watched them last Sunday so it's M turn to watch them. Earlier before my parents left M came to my room and asked if I could watch the dogs because she need to do something for Genshin, I said no because it's a game and I watched them last time and it's her turn. This was a couple of hours before my parents left. I don't know why she could not do it at that moment. She was mad and she told our father I'm watching them when I said no to M. Then we were called down to the kitchen to say they were leaving and who is gonna watch the dogs. I said I did it last Sunday, so it's M turn. M has not come down yet, but when she does, my mother says it's your turn. M gets mad she says she needs to do something, and she said to me will your shut up and stop telling our parents everything.vShe says she needs to do something, and that won't take long, only a few minutes. (When she first talked to me, she did not say how long, so I thought it was for the whole time. My parents are gone for 3-4 hours) I had to watch them for a few minutes so she could do her thing and my Mother is upset and did say after this I won't ask you for any favors anymore. So was I the asshole in this situation or my sister because I feel as if it was me.  
(Me and my sister have never had a good relationship, and we both are total opposites)

If you have any questions for me, please comment them and I will try to respond when I get the chance 

(I watch the dogs whenever she goes to horse (Wednesdays and whenever she wants to go there) with my father, and my mother has a night job. They leave at 5:00 and are back at 7:00 sometime 8:00.

amitheasshole,AITAH for kicking out my fianc√©‚Äôs friend,43,2025-03-30 02:07:47,71,"I 20F have been with my fianc√© since we were young (4 years now) he is 22M. We got engaged earlier this year and have an amazing relationship, we have had rough patches and worked through it. We‚Äôre in an amazing place. The problem is his friend also 22M was stuck for somewhere to live. So we took him in, the agreement was temporary till he could sort something permanent. There was no problems till the comments started ‚Äúthis is permanent now then‚Äù and comments about how he was getting meals made for him (payed for by us too) and it was restaurant service, he would leave dirty dishes in kitchen after this. This I could get over but our situation is that my dad owns the house but lets us live on our own in it rent/utility free (I‚Äôm aware that our situation is very lucky), his friend knew this and started comments about how he had ‚Äúmore of a right to be here‚Äù as he was paying toward utilities to my dad. I did have to stop myself from being petty and commenting how this is due to the fact he isn‚Äôt family, I‚Äôm not proud that it came into my head but I also think I was correct and not in wrong, I didn‚Äôt speak this out loud. The friend continued to not help around the house and it came to a head, I told him to start helping or go somewhere else. He moved out and now is blaming me to everyone we mutually know that I kicked him out and that I was in the wrong. He was here for 6 months. So am I the asshole? I really want to know as I second doubt myself. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions, thank you. 

Edit:
My fiance has supported me through this and had spoken to the friend previously. Nothing changed, our engagement party is soon and he fully agrees with not inviting said friend even though he has left the house as he understands how this has all made me feel. I didn‚Äôt think this was important as it‚Äôs my family‚Äôs home and the friend reached out to me, I made the decision to take him in, not my fianc√©. So please no more blaming him for what has happened, he was not at blame and we are honestly in a great relationship where we openly talk. Yes we are young get over it, I get that it maybe hard to believe due to is being young but I‚Äôve been through issues prior and we are in a space that is open and honest."
amitheasshole,WIBTA...trip for daughters' wedding...,0,2025-03-30 22:10:24,11,"So, my daughter is getting married in a couple weeks.  It's a quick wedding because her guy is Air Force, and they have to be married for her to live on base with him.  I'm planning on going up because it's my daughter and it's her wedding.  He's a good guy, and I like him.  Here's where the dilemma comes in.  So, she lives about 9 hours norrth of me.  I was at my parents' this weekend and my dad mentioned me coming part way over to them, and we'd leave one of our cars at a friends' house, and drive up together.  I've already made plans (before talking to dad) to meet up with old friends up there.  Plus, it would REALLY put a crimp in EVERYTHING I do in the car.  

  
I DO get along with my parents.  They are very religious, and I share some of their beliefs, but dad likes to preach...way too much.  Here's the REAL kicker.  My daughter is likely to be the ONLY grandchild that he gets to see get married.  Dad says there's no pressure to go up together, and it would be OK if I went alone.  That said, I could hear it in his voice that he wants to go.  I did get everything figured out that I could do a video call of the ceremony, so they don't miss it.  Mom would not be able to go.  

  
Honestly, I'd prefer to go alone.  They do talk to my daughter via text and phone calls, so they do have contact.  They have not seen each other in a while because of the distance involved.  It helps that if dad goes, he'll help with costs...and that's a BIG deal.  

  
So, people of Reddit...for the first time ever, I'm asking...would I be the asshole to go alone?"
amitheasshole,AITA for not inviting my Aunt to my wedding,60,2025-03-30 00:00:02,26,"Throwaway account for privacy. I‚Äôm getting married this summer, and we‚Äôre planning a fairly large wedding. My fianc√©‚Äôs parents have been incredibly generous in helping fund the event, while my parents haven‚Äôt contributed much‚Äîwhich is totally fine. We‚Äôve decided not to invite a few problematic family members, but the one causing the most pushback from my side of the family is my aunt. She‚Äôs about 12 years older than me, and to be honest, she‚Äôs not a good person. She‚Äôs struggled with drug addiction for most of my life and has stolen from, berated, and harassed other family members. Her two children had to be adopted by other relatives (one of them is now my sister) because of her negligence and selfishness. Both of them are invited to the wedding and have made it clear they don‚Äôt want her there either. I‚Äôve heard from other family members that she‚Äôs sober from drugs now, but she‚Äôs still drinking heavily. Since we‚Äôre having an open bar, I‚Äôm worried about how she might behave. I don‚Äôt want to risk her ruining our day. My parents think I owe her a direct explanation about why she‚Äôs not invited, but I feel like simply not sending her an invite is enough. What do you think?

Edit: I‚Äôm getting pressure from my parents and grandparents to include her. They have somewhat of a relationship with her and I think don‚Äôt want that to be awkward. I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs my problem but I don‚Äôt want to cause unnecessary issues for anyone else either."
amitheasshole,AITA for cancelling a day trip super last minute due to illness?,10,2025-03-30 09:32:52,41,"For context, I have been unwell for over a month. I had a seizure which has since rendered me pretty useless - I feel lightheaded, dizzy, and stressed every day, and can‚Äôt spend long periods of time without lying down. A lot of it is probably psychosomatic, but none the less I‚Äôve been feeling pretty bad. 

I had some improvements in the last few days and when invited on a day trip, I decided to say yes as I knew I was improving. I had reimbursed a friend for the ticket, as they had booked it for me. The night before the trip, I really struggled to sleep, and averaged out at about 2 hours sleep. My first seizure was partially brought on by lack of sleep and I woke up feeling similar to how I felt that day. I was a little stressed out and ended up backing out of the trip. It was a group trip so I wasn‚Äôt leaving anyone alone. I had really wanted to visit this place, and apologised for being such a flake. I felt guilty and embarrassed for having to back out at the last minute, but my friends were aware of my situation. 

Both friends were somewhat pissed off and didn‚Äôt really want to engage with me. One friend is particularly annoyed, and honestly, I‚Äôm not really sure why. I understand it‚Äôs irritating for someone to back out but it would have been worse to put them out by having another episode and ruining their day. I also don‚Äôt owe them any money as I had sent them what I owed them for the ticket. They also haven‚Äôt explained how they feel or why they feel that way but confirmed they were annoyed. 

I‚Äôm already having a really tough time as I‚Äôm never well enough to stay out for a full day/night and I was looking forward to seeing a new place. I‚Äôm sick of missing out on stuff and constantly being stressed, which they know. I do feel really guilty for having to cancel so last minute but I didn‚Äôt think it would make a difference to their plan. 

Edit: they were actually there when I had the seizure, so they saw how terrified I was. I was taken to hospital and had various tests, nothing much came back (other than anemia) and I was told just to be on watch in case it happens again. As I‚Äôve mentioned, I do feel *physically* unwell, but it could be psychological. And I have an appointment booked with a doctor  for next week. ( the wait is only because I am on a study abroad programme and would rather see a doctor in my home country, which is where I‚Äôm going next week) "
amitheasshole,AITA for not letting my wife hang out with her best friend,1,2025-03-30 22:02:14,2,"Last year,I 32(m), have been working a couple hours from my house, 5 days a week for a few months. My wife, 28, and I haven't gotten to see each other a lot in that time but we make it work. Her birthday was Friday and she said that she was going to hangout with her best friend 29(f) before and after I got home. I didn't think it was a problem since it was her birthday and she wanted to have some girl time with her.
 
I decided in the meantime to spend time with my brother for a few hours until she was done. She called and said that she was too drunk to drive and to come to her friends house and hang out, since her friend was a mutual friend. I arrived and started hanging out and drinking more and I started drinking. I slammed way too many and way too quickly and got wasted to the point of where I couldn't find the restroom to take a shower (I haven't taken one since the day before). I wind up passing out on the couch until she wakes me up that evening to come to bed.

 I woke up the next morning and my wife and her friend were acting a little off, but I thought it was just because of the hangovers. I didn't think much about it and proceeded to have an afternoon with my wife until we had to go get our kids. 

Fast forward to Sunday evening when I was getting my clothes packed for work the next week. She come out of the bedroom and asks for me to sit down on the couch because she had something to tell me. My face got home, expecting the worst. She proceeded to tell me that while I was asleep that night, she cheated on me with her friend. She said that she didn't sleep with her, but only got top less and kissed a little bit, before stopping it. She was crying and saying that she was so sorry for doing it and not telling me. I asked her why, and she said that she was having a good weekend and didn't want to ruin it. I threw all of my clothes in my suitcase and went to my car to leave her. She came out and begged me to come back, I agreed but didn't speak to her for the rest of the night. 

She's the kind of woman that will never lie to me, no matter how hard it is. But now, I can't trust her anymore and it sucks. Because every time I'm at work, I always think she's seeing her friend behind my back, and can't think anything else. She's told me time and time again it was a mistake, but I can't get past it, despite it being over a year ago. I told her after this she is never allowed to see her, talk to her, or bring her up ever again because I cannot trust something wont happen. She was distraught since it was basically her only friend, but she messed it up.  Am I the asshole?"
